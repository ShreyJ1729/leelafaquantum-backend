So let's jump right in, of course we got some disclaimers, this material is for research purposes only, C60 oil is not approved for consumption by the FDA, you understand that making and consuming C60 oil is experimental and you do so at your own risk. I don't endorse products, I don't have a stake in any company or product and I don't get made for making videos, this is just from me to you, educational purposes only."
