And don't worry about the 100 bucks to buy your stuff, because, you know, you're going to be using it over and over. But what really counts is the ingredients. And that is the number. And there you go. That is the end. So, but I do want to talk about one last thing before I go. And that is, there actually are a couple other considerations in my research that I came up with.

You know, this thing is, you know, depending on brands of stirs, they can get noisy. And I know that the ultrasonic cleaners are quite noisy.

You know, for a one-liter Myron glass bottle, it's about 14 bucks on Amazon. Very, very cheap. And what Myron is, it's a violet, it's a violet-colored bottle.
