Welcome to Layla Q otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade, a video FAQ series to answer frequently asked questions in our Telegram chat groups. Today's question in this video is the frequently asked question we get on what is quantum energy. Now there's two answers to that. First of all there's a"

So I personally have done two video series on the subject. One of the video series and all the links will be in the video description below for anyone who likes you know who likes to kind of get into the detail of things but essentially what my approach has been is to look at quantum energy initially from the classical academic concepts of"
