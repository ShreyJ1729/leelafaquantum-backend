Basically, it's a video FAQ series for people that are new to Layla Quantum Tech and or just existing customers who have general questions. So we're trying to just kind of make videos to answer the questions because sometimes it's just easier to make a little video to give you all of the different, you know, information related to a particular question,"

And so, you know, what are the options and what are the best approaches towards, you know, bringing quantum energy into my child's life. So now as it relates to children, I do want to kind of just share that. You know, you really got two options."

And so you could set your child up for a U subscription and then and then have the benefits of quantum energy for your child. And then I'll go into the detail here in a second. Your other option is to provide your child with a wearable. And so there's different wearables that they could wear."

You can either send the energy to them so that they're always in this little protective quantum energy bubble or they can wear something on their person and be inside of a little quantum energy bubble. So those are your two main choices. The first one here I want to kind of focus it on is the quantum upgrade service. Now, as I mentioned, it's a kind of based on the concept of quantum entanglement. You enter in the information about your child into the subscription and then"

You can pause it at any time. You can adjust the settings on terms of energy levels. You can set timers day and night. And so there's a lot of flexibility. And literally it is the easiest thing. If you have a child, the quantum upgrades subscription for you where they, the child would be the you would be the perfect thing"

So, you know, you don't want to spend a hundred bucks, two hundred bucks, and then the kid loses it. Right. So so there's really that's the most brilliant part about the upgrade service is you can provide your child with this protective energy bubble and all the benefits that come from it without having to worry about anything that's going to get lost. Again, it's 24/7 and the boosters."

By the way, there is a free trial if you just want to give it a shot, right?
