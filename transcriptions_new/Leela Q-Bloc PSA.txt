A couple of weeks ago, I had a great interview with Philip Von Holtendorf at Leyla Quantum Tech about their new product there called the Leyla Quantum Block. Now, that video went an hour and 45 minutes, which was way longer than I anticipated, but it was just such an interesting discussion about this new product. So, what I tried to do is just I just spent the last couple of days,"

        "text": "and what I've done for anyone who's interested is that I've broken down the main questions I were asked during that long interview into an FAQ. I put it up on my blog, link below, so that if you want to just go straight to the question that's interest you, I created an overview section of the questions there. Like, what is it? What does it do? How do you know it does what you say it does? How big's that field, you know, all that stuff?"

You know, how to transfer sound in my favorite, how to use it for quantum entanglement, which is something I am definitely going to be experimenting with, tinkering, and then, you know, purchase instructions. So, right here, you know, this is, if you click on any one of these, like, click on this one, what is the Leyla Cube block? It's going to pop up an unlisted video that you can go ahead"

I think it's going to be a lot easier if you had any interest at all in the Leyla Cube block. Now, in terms of purchase instructions, I just want to just throw this out there that I didn't know when I was interviewing Philip is that he's made an offer. Now, so if you go to the website, you know, you'll see in"

I think he promised to the end of the month, at least, for like $9.99, right? So it's like, like, you know, a third off. But then what he did was is in the telegram chat group for the quantum, you know, the quantum power group, which is our, you know, which is our telegram group attached to Leyla Cube, he made an announcement. And I don't"

So that is literally, you know, I think it's like almost 75% off at that point. So I just wanted to point that"

So I just want to throw that out because, you know, telegram, the way that thing works, right? You, you can jump in and you might have missed like 100 posts, and you just skip it and go to the bottom, see what's going"

You know, I don't get anything out of selling cube blocks. I just wanted to let you all know in case anyone was interested in getting one, or you had questions about them. So there you go. And just as an FYI, the infinity block is coming out next week, and I'll be interviewing"

It's just different and bigger and stronger than the cube block. So that'll be interesting conversation. And I'm looking forward to that. And I will definitely have that up next weekend. And other than that, Aloha. Have a good day."
