So here we go. Now when I mentioned glass suction filters I'm talking about these little glass rigs where there's a funnel on top glass thing you know glass flask and then right here is you either have a"

So let me just real just quick so we're on the same page. These glass ones there's a lot of pros and cons for both but the glass ones are obviously the most economical.
