That's it guys What is quantum energy? Well quantum energy is ether But it's also the energy, you know, but it's also, um"

How do I use this in my day-to-day life? Well If we understand that everything's energy, then how do we manipulate it? Well through sound and geometry and frequency and so forth So that kind of wraps up where I really believe at this point and this is my theory that ether"

There's well over 16 now that Layla has done and exactly what is the Within the context of the energy universe, um, you know, how does it work? What's driving those results and I kind of kind of figured it out where it's like those biological processes"

And that's a real important aspect of it as well. And then how does that all fold in the quantum healing? So that's going to be part three"

That's my blog. Of course I got the youtube channel if you enjoy this type of content like and subscribe, but thank you very much I hope you gave I gave you something to think about Uh, and I'd love to know if you agree disagree or whatever, please comment below, but that's my theory This is my humble opinion"
