Well, this study was done obviously back in 2019, published 2020, and basically it was a study to determine if there was a better way of producing hydrogen using electrolysis that was less toxic. So they decided to take stainless steel plates, plate them with nickel to see if that was not as bad as just plain stainless steel."
