Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech and/or quantum upgrade. The question today in this video to answer is, does quantum energy stimulate mold had a chance to talk with Philip von Holzendorf, the owner operator of Layla Q. And here's his answer kind of related to EMF. I mean, you know, some of the research that shows EMF actually stimulates mold. You know, so I wanted to ask you about mold fungi and pathogens."

        "text": "The question is, if I have a block in my house or quantum upgrade location, am I stimulating the, you know, the mold in the house? No, not at all. You actually contain it and we've, we've monitored this multiple times. And we, we even had, I think, someone from the community with a significant mold issues after some flooding. And we also specifically monitored her home. And no, not at all. It actually helps with that. Okay. Yeah."

        "text": "So your actual studies are showing that outside is just as effective, you know, being treated to quantum energy outside is just as effective as mitigating and or restraining mold proliferation as insight, right? Inside your body. In regards to mold, that is what we can say. Yes. Okay. Oh, that's perfect. Okay. That's, that's the base. So that's the answer to that. So that's it. Quick and easy. So thank you very much for watching the video. Vylandang to our German friends. And if there's any other questions you might have, check the playlist here on"
