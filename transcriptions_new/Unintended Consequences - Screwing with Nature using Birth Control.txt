And when I thought about this, I think that we're going to go in three different directions. And I think that when you look at the three directions we're going is that as natural selection continues, they'll always be people. And when you look at 300 million women, there's nine billion"

But the one that's most concerning that we have the most amount of concern about, and we have the data for that's been shared with you just now, are the ones that are producing genetic weaknesses. When you mate with the wrong person genetically, you produce a genetically weaker offspring, what happens if those genetically weaker offspring go on to themselves like mothers encouraging daughters to use oral contraceptives and so on and so on.
