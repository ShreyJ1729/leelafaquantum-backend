I'm your host Kalmer and in this video I'd like to share with you a bioelectromagnetic healing device called the biophotonic multi-wave oscillator. It's essentially what I would think that if there's ever going to be medbed technology that this would be incorporated into that because this is clearly the concept of healing in the 21st century. So let me let me kind of just explain what"
