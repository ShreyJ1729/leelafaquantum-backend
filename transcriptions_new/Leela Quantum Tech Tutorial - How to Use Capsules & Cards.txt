And we are gonna do today a tutorial on how to use Leila capsules and Leila quantum cards. And so I wanna first say, good morning, Philip. How are you today? Welcome. - Hi Kay, happy Friday. - Yeah, happy Friday. It's July 4th week, and everybody today, we're recording this on July 1st."

And so he's the go-to guy. He is our sensei for the quantum power group, and he's the man."

So how would you say in terms of energy level, you know, are these, are these, is that, 'cause I've always thought that the empty capsule because it has about as much, it has a little bit more metal than the card, but I was always thinking that they were the same.

But, you know, I agree with you, because I've been hanging out in the chat room for two years. And yeah, the majority of people can just start off with five spheres, no problem.

You could turn up the energy, or you can turn down the energy just by adding or taking out spheres, right? And I think that's an important part.

What is the max time a card should be in the IB? I think that we've covered that. It's like, if I wanted to make a foil with an IB, with using a card as the source frequency, it was like 15 seconds, right? I'm just trying to remember. - Yeah, it's pretty much done in 15 seconds."

That's really fine, then I would remove the card because, again, you know, the cards you don't want to have in there for too long, not for three minutes, cumulative. So, yeah. - Okay, 15, 20 seconds, tops. Okay, now next one, regarding the neutral capsules and spheres coming out, charged in that 2,000 Hawkins scale IB, why would it not overload our nervous system wearing it?"

How do they get in, they don't own a block? Is Layla gonna start selling replacement spheres? - I don't think so, to be honest, but if you lost spheres, then just reach out to Emma on Telegram or at support@lilaq.com"

And so there's a way to add an intention to a capsule. And even like with the Agni,"

So if I wanted to add a mantra or an intention to my capsule, I'm just gonna say it if you correct me from wrong, then all I need to do is just write down my intention. Like I, you know, whatever your intention might be, like let it go, you know, you're having a problem breaking up with someone or you know, whatever it might be, you know, help me lose weight or I will not eat as much.

And that's how you add an intention to a capsule. Is that correct? - Yes, that's definitely one and an easy way to do it. If someone also has a block, for example, then you could take a little piece of an aluminum foil"

You can still make it work though. And yeah, but those are the two ways that I see that are available to us."
