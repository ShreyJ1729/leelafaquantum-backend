A friend of mine today asked me how to go out about making them and links to supplies and things like that and I thought I would just whip up a quick video tutorial to show him and also anyone else that's interested in how to go about making your own. So you know if you go to the website the primary"

Okay so the main thing that I've learned over time is that the best practice is really my best tips for you is just make a neutral capsule and all of my capsules right now because I haven't switched to this way of doing things but all of my capsules right now are frequency specific meaning I put the frequency in the capsule itself but you know going forward though I'm actually gonna be making just one neutral capsule"
