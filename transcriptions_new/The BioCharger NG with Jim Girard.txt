I'm your host Kay Elmer and today I have got a great pleasure to be doing an interview with Jim Gerard on the bio-charger and G. It is just going to be a fascinating discussion if you haven't known who you know you don't know who Jim Gerard is. Let me go ahead and I'll just do a quick intro and then Jim will bring you in.
