I mean, in the beginning of January, it was very expensive to buy C60 oil directly. And this was what caused me and a lot of folks that I know to start making it ourselves. And so as people more and more and more and more folks are making it and selling it, the prices have come down. And now what's interesting for you guys in the market"

This seems to be the trough right here between 10 and $11 is going to be what the price going forward may be as the standard quote market price. So that's pretty interesting how for the last three, it's just really in this real really narrow channel in terms of prices. So it seems like the prices have really stabilized. The prices for Rossi 60 are a little, you know, Wild West right now,"

So, you know, until that really, I mean, really, when you're looking at price fluctuations, you shouldn't have a variant of 300%. That means you have a very unstable and volatile marketplace. But now, you look at this right here, you have a very stabilized marketplace. The prices are remaining"

Last thing I want to just make a point of and, you know, while this pricing guide is about buying C 60 oil, I am a proponent of making your own. It's so simple. And you know, a lot of folks in the beginning, when it was like this up here at 18 bucks, I used to read comment after comment after comment in YouTube videos about C 60 where people were just be like, I can't afford it. This is"

They just, there's no way they could put out, you know, 50 bucks or a little tiny little bottle that'll last them a two weeks, you know. So, that's that was, you know, that's why I kind of got into the whole make it yourself. I wanted to teach people how to make it themselves. So they could, they could, you know, take this, this incredible supplement. So here you go. So I just wanted to update the cost your own. So,"

Okay, 86 bucks, you know, this is current right now on Amazon, 87 bucks free shipping. Okay, that's all you would have to buy for equipment. That's it. And then let's say put that aside. And then you just get some olive oil. Okay, one liter of olive oil, get a gram, get the 220, because that's the only guy that's going to ship it to you. The lowest price right now is bucky labs 220. They will ship today. And so you buy that and boom,"

That's 1049, 716, you save 32%. Okay, now note back here, when C 60 raw C 60 powder was way cheaper. I was, I think my first video where I made it, I think it only costs me $3.65"

And you know, if you take as much C 60 as I do and some other folks, where it's like me and my dog, and we're like grinding through like, you know, a bottle, easy, a week, you know, and you know, big bottles. And so you can still save a lot of money. And that's saving a lot of money. Really, really, really, really adds up over time. So anyway,"
