I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and in this video I'd like to address a question that was popped up in our telegram chat group on the quantum power channel And it was involving someone asking about you know Has there been any studies on chemtrails or I guess the question specifically was is do the blocks have any effect on chemtrails? So I just wanted to kind of highlight one of the studies that was done by the BESSA Institute"

Let's go find out What the effect of quantum energy is on? Chemtrails because as you for those of you who know what those are You know it's stuff that sprayed in the air and it sinks down and then what better place to then kind of test it"

I actually did a 10-minute"
