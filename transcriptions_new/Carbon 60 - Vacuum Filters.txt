So I learned a lot and I wanted to share what I learned with you."

You stir for a couple of weeks and you let it settle for 10 days or a couple of weeks. You can change up the duration of these two steps any which way you like. You don't want to skimp on settling though so you can go longer. That's my tip there and you'll have you know you'll have C60 oil. Now the last step is filtering. So now why"
