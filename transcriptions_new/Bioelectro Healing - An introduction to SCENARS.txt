So, of the dozens of different bioelectrical magnetic devices that I have, I do get asked every now and then if I could only have one device, which one would it be? And you know, the answer is, I would want a Cenar. And let me tell you why. However, before we jump into that, let's talk about disclaimers."

Again, if you want to learn how to use it, then you could go, you know, and read through the manuals, but I did want to tell you that I've got this little training folder right here that I'm going to share with you. And basically it's over the years I've been collecting all these different videos as I find them on YouTube and wherever about how to use one. And so these are like, it's like all these different tutorials on how to use the denazs,"

And that's the most, for me it's one of the most important things because, you know, my family includes my dogs. And so it's a little different, okay, now, and this is something I want to do point out, like this little guy right here for the human hair, it doesn't work on animals, okay? And so what works on animals, okay, is they make special cuffs, which I don't have a picture"

You put the probe on the gel and then that way the electrical pulse can pass through to the skin. Otherwise you have to shave them, and you know, some of you might not want to shave"

And they really, and you know, so far I haven't seen any of these guys actually produce an accessory that works for that, but I did find an accessory with the frequency specific guys, the FSM guys, and they actually created a cuff to go with their devices that does work as well as, you know, and I use, I just use an electro gel."

Okay, so, but this is not cheap, okay, so the cheaper way to do it is by a regular one in this one."
