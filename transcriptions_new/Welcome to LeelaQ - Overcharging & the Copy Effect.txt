All right, so let's jump right in. Now, the first thing is, is what is overcharging? Well, it doesn't happen with quantum upgrade. It just cannot happen with quantum upgrades. So nothing to worry about that. But if you have a block, okay, then if you were to take something and put it in a block, and this only applies,"

And so now if you go over that time, then that's simply called overcharging. Okay, so it's as simple as that.

The recommendations from Layla is if you've got an overcharged item, if it's a card, you know, cards are not like the weakest object that they sell. And, you know, like, again, it's like a four inch field. It's not that big. That's radius by the way. Then you just keep it six inches apart. So you would if you had like all these little foils that you've been put in your blog, treating different people and animals, no problem. If you don't want to"

It just is what it is. I mean, it's just, you're just creating more energy in a particular object. And if you want, you know, and you could actually be doing that on purpose and for a very, you know, for whatever reason you want. However, you know, again, you know, there are two downsides.
