People lived in a world where there wasn't any radio frequencies, airport radars, satellite, beaming stuff down into your brain."

And now there's no electrical field here because, you know, they thought about electricity, but they didn't think about a magnetic field."

And I do know that the health threshold, if you think about frequency, because you got more than just fields, you've got frequency, is that this, you know, like everybody talks"

Now the frequencies are going to permeate the area that they're in. And so if you're sitting in the middle of a room and the room has got wires all around it, then you're in that frequency or you're going to be subjected to the frequency. So this is another meter also sold by LECEMF and it's called a Steitzer."

I don't want it to be that high, then all you got to do is you take in, you take one of the stetzer filters, and then you would just go ahead and plug it in to, and not hopefully, and the minute I plugged in the filter, you could see it dropped.

It goes into the filter, the filter then brings the frequency down, and then the meter now shows that it's at a healthy range.
