Now number 13 from other conversations about upgraded infinity blocks. Each generation has its own character, right? So this came from this morning. And so the idea here was a couple of years ago, you and I had a Q and A where I was asking you about the different generations."

Was what I think was an IB four. And then you said you hadn't checked, you hadn't tested all of them, but you knew that every time you upgrade to a generation, the reason to recommend the people would just, you know, acclimate to that for a few months was it has its own character and it gives your body and your environment time to acclimate to the higher energy."

So there's this idea of character per generation. So the question is, is if they boosted, are they going to, you know, they kind of leapfrog past all of that stuff? So I guess the question is, um, every, every upgrade, every generation has a character to it. Um, and it's wise to bond with that before the next upgrade."

So that if that's the case, the question is, would we be missing out on certain characters and learnings if we jump straight to 2700 with the capsule upgrade? Short cut. Well, it's a good question, but the answer is no, you're not missing out on, uh, on"

You know what I mean? It's just way more beneficial for your whole system and being, uh, to have all"
