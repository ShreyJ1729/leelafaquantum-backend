You know, God bless him But when he was tinkering around in the early days along with myself and a bunch of others He discovered where he took the frequency of plant food"

So if you had a block in the middle of your garden And you want it to then, okay, I'm gonna, I want to do more than just frequency or I mean more than just energy Right here's an infinity block than what I would take is literally just a little cup Of plant food And I put it inside the infinity block and that frequency of that plant food is going to go throughout your garden"
