I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and this video is a Lele Q, otherwise known as Lele Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade product updates. I had a chance to talk with Phillip this week, the owner, operator of Lele Quantum Tech, where we talked about a bunch of different topics. And one of those topics was what are the new products and services that are recently launched that we haven't talked about in our on this channel, as well as what are some of the new things that are coming down the pipe over the next year."

I'm looking forward to it as well. So I just wanted to share with you that video clip on all of the new stuff that's in the works and when it's gonna be launched or when it's planned to be launched so that you can kind of get an idea, like what's coming up and all the good news for that. So here we go, I'm gonna go ahead and play the clip because this is such a popular topic"

So if you don't mind, can we just kind of, I know you got a hard stop in five minutes or maybe just like a quick little elevator speech but the list that we're seeing right now on the slide, these are the five things that you've posted about and just kind of wanted to get an update on them. And if you have time, maybe what else is not on the list. But so since we last talked about new products,"

So for people that didn't know about that, could you kind of describe what that is for Traum EZ? It's part of the app now and it's called 360 Perception Boost. - Yes, this is a quite interesting one because it's literally the case when you wear glasses, sunglasses or contacts of any kind,"

And you're then suddenly just very focused on what's in front of you and you're not really connected to the big picture anymore and you lose your 360 Perception."

Because that's a different level of consciousness and awareness that they have and connection, right? That they have so deeply established that that just doesn't happen. But to the random person, which I would say is like over 99.5% of the people probably, it happens to them, right?"

I know you've got a hard stop in three minutes, so let me just ask you each one of these and if you could just tell us when do you think they'll be released and we'll get into the descriptions. I can provide those in the chat group afterwards, but you mentioned the super grand block in January. Is that correct? That'll be released in January? - That's what you're trying. - You're trying, okay. - That's what we're trying."

And then in the Quantum Masterclass, I'm assuming you mean the basically Quantum Wellness Practitioner course. - Okay, that's what it's called, okay. - I think more or less, I think we haven't fully named everybody. We're working on it and I honestly, I think we wanted to launch it this year and maybe we start in this year,"

And then it's about the whole description website, blah, blah, blah. So, you know, it would be January, maybe a little bit before. Quantum diagnostics, okay, yeah, that's a TAFA one.

But that's an exciting, exciting process. - Yeah, I'm looking forward to that one. Okay. So then you mentioned the jacket. When, when's the new jacket gonna be out now,"

(laughs) - Hmm, what should I say? - Yeah, I always say that you usually do, but don't count on it, you know, whatever, but what's the words? - I'm not allowed to say it, but you know, you-- - No spoilers."

I really appreciate it, Phillip. I know you gotta run, but thanks so much for clarifying all this stuff. I'm gonna put this together and get it out to the group.
