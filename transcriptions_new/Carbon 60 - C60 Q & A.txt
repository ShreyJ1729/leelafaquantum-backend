I've had a couple of questions lately about sonication, and Mr. Buxke here just posted this morning on the C60 Good Vibe chat room, and you know, five questions for me, and it's a lot easier to just record the answer than type it all out, and then I realized, you know, I might as well just make this public because you probably, other people probably"

I do appreciate it. The first question now is, number one, is the ultrasonic DIY method by using the recommended device, not only the fastest, but also the generally better way to DIY C60 that you could personally recommend ultrasonic better than stirring for 14 days?"

You know, when you look at making C60, there's a fast way, and then there's the benchmark standard Bati way, which is in two weeks, turbo, right? So that's the standard, that's the benchmark stir two weeks, but there are ways to make it faster, and ultrasonic is one way, and the other way, which I've just been tinkering with in the last couple of months, is using heat."

So let's stay in the fast lane. In the fast lane, there are two ways to do it, and I would recommend that the better fast way is using heat, and only for the purpose, because it's just a lot less hassle. When you use a sonicator, you've got a lot of things you got to worry about."

You can literally mix your C60 in 24 hours, and let it sit for 10 days, and boom, off you go. So it does really cut down that 14 day stir time, cuts it down to one day."
