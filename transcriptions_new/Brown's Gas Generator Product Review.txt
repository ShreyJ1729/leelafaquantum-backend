I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and in this video, I'd like to share with you a Brown's Gas Generator for Health Product Review. Now, what I've done is for the last month, this whole week, I've basically been scouring the internet, trying to find every possible generator out there, H.H.O. / Brown's Gas, generators that have been specifically designed for health purposes. I did come up with 15 different generators, put together a product comparison matrix, and I thought you'd be interested in it."

Yeah, certainly you could do that, but I want to point out something that's so important about this whole concept. And that's an article, well, not really an article.

A dry cell is where the electrolysis process is not immersed in water and water is inside of the, you know, of the electrolysis plate. So the water comes in here and it kind of goes through these plates and then it goes off into the bubbler back here, right? This is just like the ugliest examples, but the only ones I could find."

So it's either gonna be outside the water where the water's inside this, you know, electrolysis cells or the entire electrolysis cells is inside the water. So it's wet versus dry. That's the difference there. Now, why is it important? Well, if it's a wet cell, the thing can run like 24 hours"

Now you put the metal inside the water and then you put, give it some current. Okay, and then off of the anode comes oxygen and off of the cathode comes hydrogen.

And then the oxygen just gets pumped out the back to exhaust or the smarter ones are the ones where they've got two ports where they're giving you the oxygen and they're giving you the hydrogen.

Okay, so in, you know, using off of a generator. So you're getting oxygen generated by, you know, and combining with hydrogen. And that is to me, you know, it's basically like, you know, a plus, right? You've got, you've got the benefits of hydrogen. You've got the benefits of oxygen.

So I don't think that there's, personally, I don't think that there's a detriment to getting an H-H-O generator for health over getting a brown-scast generator for health. That's my personal opinion. However, for those of you that are truly, really into the science, you know, or the, you know, the, I guess it's the biohacking aspect of it."

But a brown-scast has the oxygen, plus it's got EXW, and you're getting even more benefit. And so that's kind of like the difference to me."

So, wanted to make that statement, but that's why they're included here. So now, that's the difference here, is whether or not it has a membrane.

Okay, and that's the difference there. Now, the gas production, as I pointed out, you know, all of them are adequate for two people at a time, which is really good, and because, you know,"
