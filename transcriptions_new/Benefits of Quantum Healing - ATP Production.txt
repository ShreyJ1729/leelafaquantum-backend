This video covers a study produced in 2023 on the effects of quantum energy as it has"

Well it turns out that it is the metabolic process within every cell that exists in our bodies, in plants, any animals, everything living that has cells has to have a metabolic process by which it converts food into energy and that's really"

At this very moment trillions of energy releases are happening all throughout your body contributing to a variety of functions including body temperature. ATP or adenosine triphosphate is commonly referred to as the energy currency of the body. It's created through aerobic and anaerobic respiration as well"
