Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech, where I'm basically going over all of the frequently asked questions that pop up in the telegram support groups for the Layla quantum devices, as well as the quantum upgrade. I had the opportunity to sit down with Philip and get his take on several topics. And this video is"

So let me go ahead and play that clip for you. And just want to say thank you very much for watching the video. First slide is the solar flares. Okay, so that was a big one that's come up. There's been three X squares just this week. Today's October 10, 2024. We are"

Earlier in March, we had one of the biggest flares ever recorded that literally shaped and and vibrated the magnetosphere for months. So, you know, there's there's been questions about the solar flares and all that cosmic, you know, energy coming on to the planet. So the question really is, is like, you know, there's been a lot of discussion, but"
