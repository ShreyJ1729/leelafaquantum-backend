And it's this little guy right here and just kind of give you a perspective on how big it is. It's actually about the size of a wine glass. So you can kind of see how little it is.

I guess that's a safe way to put it. All right, so that's good to know. Now, something you said, somebody asked a question I thought was wild, which was can I take my travel block, put it in the grand block and would it upgrade my travel block?

(laughing) - Yeah, as a parents to be like, - Stronger block, it's hard to tell, but it definitely is stronger block. Of course, if you do that, don't ever put a block in there that's still assembled because that's not going to work."

And then at the same time, you know, if I were to take my infinity block plates and put it in the ground block, would those infinity block plates pick up that harmonizing feature?

The last question here then was another question that we seem to get now when we're talking about the ground block being so much stronger in conscious levels is, the question is, is how many generations of upgrades for an infinity block would equal a ground block?

It's gonna be a big difference actually in that regard because it'll feel more rough. - Yeah, 'cause there's, right, because the infinity block doesn't have that special buffer. So only, okay, so my recommendation, you know, honestly on infinity block upgrades, you know, what's your purpose for upgrading? You know, I mean, obviously you wanna keep pace with your own ascension and vibration"

Phillip, because if you upgrade faster than you are able to keep up with your block, then automatically you will disconnect from your block. Is that correct? In terms of just warning people. - Yeah, well said. - Yeah, you'll end up disconnecting from it and it'll take a long time to reconnect with it from an entrainment standpoint."

You know, it's all nature and it needs time to adjust and, you know, while everyone's always gung-ho and they wanna try the next best thing, more energy is not always better, right? - Correct. - If you're not ready for it.

So there's, and you can find more information on the Layla Quantum Tech website by the way, all the links below to everything I mentioned will be in the video description. So you've got the Layla Quantum Tech website, you've got the Quantum Upgrade website, tons of information on both of those sites about what those do. Of course, there's the Tingers Academy."

So you can jump in there for a topic-specific question and dialogue and discussion about anything you might need help with or you have, you know, want some understanding for.
