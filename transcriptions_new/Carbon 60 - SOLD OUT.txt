Quick disclaimers, this is not a product endorsement, I do not get paid in anyway for making videos. So let's talk about this, now I just want to make a real quick video, this is a hot topic going on right now, and as you know, if you're trying to make your own C60 everywhere you go, it's sold out."

Two companies are just not taking any orders at all. So for the companies that are taking orders, you know, here's one of your options if you're trying to buy C60, just get on the list and place an order, I've actually done that with"

It didn't break out huge, but a very small population, but it was a small enough population to overwhelm the existing industry at that time."
