Before I get into that, let's talk about a couple of disclaimers. This material is for research purposes only. C60 oil is not approved for consumption by the FDA, and that you understand that making and consuming C60 oil is experimental, and you do so at your own risk. As I like to remind everyone, we are the human trial."

And a lot of folks are starting off with pulver IC60 because it's cheaper. But then what people may or may not realize is that pulver IC60 is really harder to work with than powdered C60 from a filtering standpoint."

Do I use the stone or do I? And then it's like, what kind of filters? And I got to get the right papers. There's 14 different kinds of, and you just goes on and on and on. And it's just like freaking unbelievably complicated. And all you really want to do is filter at .22 micrograms, right, and micrometers. And so skip all that complexity."

And you know, honestly, if you're just going to make a one batch a month or every now and then, don't go down the glass thing. Don't do pulverized. Stay in powdered C60 land and throw away your filter rig. It's so much easier. Trust me on that one. And so simplicity. This is what I buy. I buy both of these depending on what's on sale."

Now for those of you who are totally new and haven't done this before, let's just talk, I'm going to go, let's recap what you need to get and about what you're going to spend. So you're going to need a glass jar, a glass beaker. I mean, I've done it in a mason jar. I mean, that's what this is. Just as a test, I wanted to see, you know, is there any difference if I use a mason jar and nope. So one mason jar is like a buck or you can get fancy and get a glass beaker or 849, right?"

There's no way, I've tried to come up with creative ways to do stirring, but there is nothing other than a magnetic stir. So if you go on Amazon, you can buy them as cheap as 30 bucks, all the way up to 40 bucks, but a stir is a stir. You don't need anything super fancy. You don't need one that generates heat because you want to do all this cold, remember?"

But the next level up is around 55 bucks for some, you know, for like a really hardcore vacuum pump that looks like something you'd find on a boat or something, right?

And to kind of give you, you know, a price check, the cheapest you're going to buy per ounce anywhere as of July when I did my last pricing study was like 563.

But that's expected to alleviate just like last year, there was a shortage of C60 oil and that alleviated itself. I mean, the market corrects itself.
