You know, this material is for research purposes only. This is not any medical or health advice. I wanted to remind everybody that C60 oil is not approved for consumption by the FDA."

And mostly when you get those powders from all over, you're going to get clusters as big as 300 times that. And so, what they've done is they've created this pulverized version.

There's one comparable product, but they don't sell the actual raw C60. If you want to buy C60 in a monomolecular form, then you'd have to buy the product itself."

And so, you can go to the link below and you can kind of read through the process on how he's suggesting to use the product to make your own C60 oil. This is just pure C60.

It's my own way of doing it because I couldn't follow the directions perfectly, was essentially, it's an eight-step process. First thing you do is you just remove the excess alcohol out of the bottle. You concentrate it down to the least amount of alcohol, so that's that much less that has to evaporate off out of the oil. You put the C60 in the oil and you stir it up for a weekend using a magnetic stir."

And then you give it its first filtering, and then you let it sit again for another week and a half, and you give it its final filtering using a vacuum filter. And you start it with a bigger filter first, and the final filter is really small, so that's the process. And where I'm at right now is I'm in, basically, step three right now."

Well, it mixes it back up again, and I'm like, \"Ah!\" So then I set it to the side, and I, you know, it's three days later, I let it sit for 72 hours.
