I'm your host, Kay Almer, and this video is another installment in the video FAQ series called Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech and Quantum Uprate. So what we do is we pluck out frequently asked questions in the telegram chat groups, and either I answer them or Philip answers them, the owner operator of Layla Quantum Tech. So in this particular video, Philip is addressing the question about etheric versus molecular"

So here we go, let's hear what Philip has to say about the difference. All right, and then the other one here that kind of came up, someone was asking me, and it was kind of a good question I wanted to ask you, which was, I guess it's in the marketing description. So in the marketing description of HEAL 360, and I'm sorry, I didn't go back and verify"

But there was just a question or clarification request because it implies the way that the wording implies that the HEAL 360 is, quote, whole body healing, soul, emotions, you know, all of that. And so the question was, it was, hey, I thought HEAL 360 was all molecular. So how does, how does, if so, right, if so, how do molecular frequencies affect etheric situations?"

It's not physical anymore anyway, right? So it's already sort of etheric as you use it, right? Because it's purely energetic and especially when it's then also upcharged"

It just came from something physical. And it does not matter because you can have, you can have molecular frequencies that work on all kinds of different aspects, right? So it doesn't mean just because it came from"

I think it's more difficult to do that, but it's possible. - Okay, okay. Yeah, that's a really good way of thinking about, 'cause I was a little like, when I got asked a question, I was like, well, that's a really good question, 'cause I was thinking molecular was physical,"

So yeah, you would definitely have etheric effects from frequencies. So, okay. - In addition, also it's also not even true that it's a hundred percent molecular because there's also an additional etheric part in it, right? So the benzene gas neutralization, for example,"

If you remember, that was a frequent contest, but we still-- - You added it. - Basically added a couple pieces, yeah. - Okay, all right. No, that's cool. Okay, so that's really great. That's good to know. That's a really good way of looking at it."
