I've been interested in fullerenes for about a year. I've been taking C60 oil, and so I learned way back that people are really interested in what I've been learning, and I just wanted to start sharing.

Okay, so what is carbon 70? Well, it's basically a molecule of carbon, also a form of carbon. It's an alatropic carbon that has 70 carbon atoms in a cage-like structure, sort of like an oblong sphere. It's very similar to the C60 molecule, but it just simply has 10 additional atoms."

And so you've got diamond, which is one of the hardest substances on Earth. Simply a group of, you know, it's basically a group of carbon atoms. Then you've got graphite.

So it is so hard is so is it so hard to believe there are other spiritual energies with different qualities which can be manipulated and into C 60 olive oil, C 60 will give a very masculine central or sexual desire. And that's been proven. It's a really good for your libido. Whereas then C 70 or does the same thing for women, but in a more romantic way."

So that's what I've been able to conclude for C 70 from science studies and from what red line has told me. I got my bottle two days ago for those of you on Twitter, you know, and this was me taking my second dose. So I've taken it for two days now."

But I will tell you that because I'm on C 60, I take it in the morning and then I wait. Oh, yeah, because like right here is a caution that red line shared with me. It's super important that no vessels which contain C 60 are used with C 70 because fire will destroy the nature of C 60. So it's kind of like it's really weird."

I think it's the yin is the female and the yang is the male, I think. But you know, that's what I'm seeing here. It's there's a C 60 and a C 70, a yin and a yang male and a female. And so what's really funny is you don't put them in the same vessel because they'll destroy each other. Well, isn't that the truth? And so then I asked him."

So obviously you don't want to take them at the same time, but but specifically though, red line said, Oh, yeah, you can take them, you know, simultaneously, I mean, like, you know, you put them in your body, but, you know, but don't take them like in the same mouthful. So I am taking C 60 and I'm taking C 70. And after two days, I can tell you that every time I take the C 70, it's kind of like I get a boost, you know, you're ready to get a boost from C 60."

But when I take the C 70 on top of it a couple hours later, it's like, it's like this shot of energies like just I just get this real shot of energy. As far as any detox systems, symptoms or anything like that, I haven't haven't really experienced anything yet. It's very early in the in the in the program in my regime of taking C 70 with C 60.

So, so we'll be testing out C 70 and I will be letting you know and I'm very fascinated and this is real interesting stuff. So now what this slide talks about is making your own. So obviously you can go and buy it if you want to buy it, you know, where red line is, but can you make it your own? Obviously, yes, you can. You can totally make it yourself."

So that would be like, you know, going out and get the powder, follow the standard one to one formula, which is one gram per one liter of oil. There's very specific about using corn, neki oil and olive oil, that is. And then of course, you know, because you're using powder, the process is very simple."

I mean, right now, if you go to like Red Lion's site and you buy like the cheapest you can"

If one gram at SES costs $375 and over at MTR, one gram of C 70 is $310."

And of course, and then from a purity standpoint, the best purity I can find anywhere that provides this carbon fullerenes is 99.0. So they're happening. I mean, there hasn't even been a way for anyone to get past 99.0. It's that difficult to synthesize and therefore that much more expensive."

I may or may not depends on what happens as I take it because it has female energy. I'm hoping that it tempers with male energy and I don't get all weepy or anything. So that's not it. That's not it. And so I'm just kidding. Okay, so, but that's really it. You can make it at home."

It's like a there's a lot to learn. That's really it. There's a lot to learn about carbon 70. It has it shows that it has the possibility of incredible potential being better than C 60. You can actually go out and buy it, you know, now, which is, which is like that's never happened before. And or you can go make it and it's really expensive and that's really it."
