In his video and there's a link below and it's a good watch is that the bottles that don't have that PEM membrane that I mentioned, they do create chlorine when salts are present"

Now some of them oxygen molecules actually form to combine O2 which is oxygen gas and you know so that's you got bubbles coming up and that's oxygen and hydrogen and also some of those oxygen molecules connect together form O3 which is called ozone. Now here's the thing if there's salt in the water it will split into two and it splits"
