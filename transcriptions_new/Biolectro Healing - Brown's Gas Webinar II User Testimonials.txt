We've got several other folks that have joined the webinar. We've got Mandy and Pete and Lorne. Thank you so much for joining us today. We're going to be chatting about Brown's Gas. And first, before we jump right into that, let me just do a quick disclaimer."

Well, I would say they don't try out because I'm like, I run the gas through two bubblers and I'm thinking, is there, because I know there's a way to dry the gas, right? There's, there's dryers where you dry the gas, take the immunity out of the gas."

Yeah, exactly. And that's why I, like I said, I purposely delayed treating myself with the, the, the hydrogen to see how the PMF would work.
