I'm your host Kay Elmer and in this video I'm gonna be doing an H2 Genesis Browns gas generator also known as H-H-O unboxing and setup. This H2 Genesis is brought to you by a company called H2 Biohacker and I just got a new one. I've got two others but I just got this H2 Genesis and I thought this time hey you know I did product"

Now the first thing you're gonna get is you know this is an overview of a Browns gas generator if you're not familiar with it. These are all the different pieces. Take them just a second to kind of familiarize yourself with it but basically this here is the generator itself. Water goes into a tank in here and then there's an"
