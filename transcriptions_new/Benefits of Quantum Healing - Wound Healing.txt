I'm your host Kaelmer and this video is another installment in the video series benefits of quantum healing where I have been documenting the results of independent third-party studies commissioned by Leila Quantum Tech to understand the effects of quantum energy on various biological systems. This particular video covers a report that just was released April of 2024 on the effects of quantum energy on wound"

For the purpose of determining this, we have used the quantum upgrade system and tested it to see if it would alter the rate of"
