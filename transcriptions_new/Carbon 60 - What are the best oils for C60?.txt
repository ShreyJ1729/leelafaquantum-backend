I'm your host Kay Elmer and in this video I'd like to share with you what are the best oils to use with C60 and so the idea here is that right now in the marketplace if you are buying a C60 oil product to take as a supplement you've got a lot of different choices and different oils that it comes in and so let's take a look at what's out there in the marketplace and then let's talk about healthy versus unhealthy oils right and then"
