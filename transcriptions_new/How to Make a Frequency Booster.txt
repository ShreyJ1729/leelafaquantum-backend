I'm your host Kay Elmer and in this video I'd like to share with you how to make a frequency booster using any one of the three Leila Quantum Tech blocks.

So let's jump right into this tutorial and before we start disclaimer. Neither Leila Quantum Tech nor the Tinkers Academy recommend or"

Okay that's the first thing I want to put out there so if you're going to be using a quantum block it's it's 60 seconds to copy a frequency but three minutes to charge the object you copied it to. If you're using an infinity or a travel block it's 20 seconds to copy the frequency and then it's 60 seconds to charge the object up which is"
