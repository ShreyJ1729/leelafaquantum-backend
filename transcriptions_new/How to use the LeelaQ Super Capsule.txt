It's a really big field. It's a really strong strength, you know, that sort of concept"

I can't provide that information However, I do know that when you take all five of the spheres that come with the capsule and you put them inside the capsule Then it's gonna radiate out in 360 degrees all around it and form it like an energy bubble or an energy field and all air"
