I'm your host Kayelmer and this video is another installment in the series benefits of quantum healing specifically as it relates to pets. So what I'd like to share with you today is a study that was conducted by the Bess Institute and commissioned by Leila Quantum Tech back in 2021 and before I get into the nuts and bolts of the study itself I'd like to just kind of share with you a little bit about who the Bess Institute is and how they do their studies and then we can"
