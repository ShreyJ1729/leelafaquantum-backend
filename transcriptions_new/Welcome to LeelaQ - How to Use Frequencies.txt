Welcome to Layla Q otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech and what these video series is for is for new customers and existing customers to cover the most common questions that pop up in our telegram chat groups as to where to get help you know what the differences are between the services and the products and and on and on. Now this video specifically is how to use the frequencies. So the first thing I want to kind of convey"

One is energy, energy medicine, energy healing and all that energy stuff right but then they're also doing what's also known as vibrational medicine are also known as frequency medicine so there's two different modalities at play here so you can just get quantum energy and you know it's just boosting"

Now the frequencies come in two different flavors and one flavor is you know through the quantum upgrade you can have different frequencies you know you know broadcast to you or whatever object you've chosen to subscribe and then in the in the physical world you can carry around a card or a capsule and have that frequency vibrate you know near you and then you can expose yourself to that way. So those are the two ways to experience the frequencies"
