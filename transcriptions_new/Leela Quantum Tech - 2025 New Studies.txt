I'm your host K Elmer and this video is Philip and Von Holzendorfel Lele quantum tech discussing new studies that are coming out in 2025. We had a great chat last week about the new products coming out in 2025 and part of that chat. We covered some of the new studies. So if you wanted to hear about the new study on brain waves, we did discuss that in the 2025 new products video. And then the rest of our conversation"

There's a there's a ton of research that is going to happen, you know, as always, I think there hasn't been a single year where we didn't have significant research. I, you know, there's the 2025 could be a breakthrough year in regards"

Yeah, so with with the brainwave study, certainly it's the mitochondrial performance. We had these in vitro studies by the University"
