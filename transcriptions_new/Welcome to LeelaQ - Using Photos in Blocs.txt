Now this particular video, we're going to be talking about using photos in blocks. And what do I mean by that?"

Just like the quantum upgrade service will collect your information and send you frequencies and energy to the people, place, or whatever, right?"

And so if you put a photo in that block, then that's where it's going to go. Energy, frequency, or intentions. OK, you can manifest intentions for whatever's in that photograph.

So unlike the quantum upgrade service, there's no way to boost the energy. OK, so there's-- in the quantum upgrade service, you can actually amp up the energy. Like you have there's a baseline energy level that you've got running during the day and during the night, depending on your timing set, your time settings.

Now, when you're using a block with a photo, you cannot charge anything in the photo. OK, so you can send energy to it. But if you wanted to charge, let's say, food,"

Well, the answer used to be we'll just put the photo of the car in there. But I clarified with Philip von Holzendorf, the owner operator of Leila Quantum Tech, about that.

Now I just want to add a couple of things that I just want to emphasize. Now there's a Leila Q FAQ that is, you know, on the website. And I kind of just want to highlight a couple of things in terms of the answer to, you know, how do I use a photo and a block? I just want to highlight a couple of things"

You know, just kind of, that's how this works. Everyone is always asking, you know, how long should I leave a photo in? And my answer is always follow your intuition because there's no, you know, there's no guideline for this because it's quantum. And so the whole idea is quantum is, you know, driven by consciousness. And so really it's just, you know, when you want to use, you want to send frequency"

So just follow that. And then just kind of just, you know, see. However, there's one caveat though, is that if somebody, it does matter how healthy or how conscious someone is that you put in there, you know, talking about pictures.

Like if it does interrupt their sleep, it does, it may, you know, 'cause all of this has been tested scientifically that this works. I mean, there's, they've actually proven quantum up, you know, quantum entanglement works. The frequency, the energy actually does get delivered to the target item in the photo. So, you know, that's what the studies are. If you go on quantum upgrade and you look at the science studies, it's real, it's really going to happen."

And then if you're going to try to help them and, or the dog cat, whatever, just really pay attention to, okay, I'm going to put you in the block for a few minutes and, you know, and see how that goes and see how you feel.

And so you want to kind of be just conscious of, you know, of these three things, okay?

I've got a dog that's been in my infinity block right now for a month and I've never taken her out and I actually did confer with Phillip and Roman took a look at the dog and it was, you know, I was worried that that might be too much but it turns out that it's still not enough for that particular animal.

How do I, you know, can I send positive energy to any one of those specific towns or maybe just the whole state of North Carolina or the whole state of Florida, or even the whole region of the country?

So, I asked him, I said, well, could somebody charge a whole city? And the answer was no. It's that the, his response was in, you know, just to kind of paraphrase was, it's just not strong enough to do that big of a space, you know, 'cause all the things that are in that space, all the living creatures, all the buildings, all the, you know, just that much land.

So, if you have a farm, you know, farms could be big, but it's one single property. It has an address and you could target. So, you could take a picture of, you know, like, one of the things that I did before, there was such a thing as quantum upgrading. I went on Google Maps and got a picture of my condo building when I was living in Hawaii."
