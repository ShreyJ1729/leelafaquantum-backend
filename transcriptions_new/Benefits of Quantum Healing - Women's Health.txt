I'm your host K Elmer and this video is another installment in the series benefits of quantum healing where I'm going over the science studies that have been commissioned by Layla quantum tech on the effects of quantum energy on various subjects. This particular study released in November of 2024 is on women's health. The specific study is called quantum upgrade study finals final report and the purpose of it was to"
