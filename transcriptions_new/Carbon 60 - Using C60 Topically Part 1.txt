There was only that much left. And it really wasn't a lot. So this might look like it's a lot, but when you wipe it off, it's not. So a lot of it got absorbed. But I still think that if you stay active and you have your sweaty, your hot, your pores are open, you're going to absorb a lot more. And that's just common sense. Now, the locations of our bodies that we were putting this on"

And he used the crook of his elbow. And I checked Mark there. Because that was what he really, really liked. It worked really well for him. He did try the inner wrist. Didn't work as well.

And one thing I want to add is, Jay also mentioned that after a week or so, it didn't seem like his body was absorbing much in the same place. So he'd switch from one elbow to the next. And that seemed to continue to allow his body to absorb the maximum amount. So moving your dosing location around on your body it seemed to be a good thing. Also, that we specifically picked places on our body"

It's close to the skin where your veins are. Stay active. Keep your pores open and so forth. So those are some of the things that we learned in terms of trying to absorb as much as you can. We did also learn that between one and a half hours and three hours is how long it takes for the feeling to kick in when you know you're C60's in you and doing its job. The second thing too was that we both were experiencing"

And then there's a third day where your body just says, nope, no more, I'm not dealing with you. And I don't care how whatever, I'm just gonna get some sleep. So your body just shuts down on the third day. You get a full night's sleep and then you repeat it again. But then what's interesting is after you kinda do this enough over a few weeks, there's a point where after like the sixth day your brain activity starts to balance."

If you take enough in oil, okay? Now Jay's a little crazier than I am. He actually wanted to see what it tastes like right out of the jar, which I don't know why, but he did, you know, it's in pure alcohol, right?"

So he made it last a little bit longer than it was ever intended to. So he had like the little tip he wanted to share with everybody.

So that's a suggestion as well that we both learned from doing this because C60 topically"

This is one hour after application and muggy heat. And so this is, you know, typical Hawaii. It's about, you know, 80 degrees, 75 humidity. So it's really out, you know, I took my dogs to the park. And so this was one hour after I put this on. This was completely black. And then one hour later, you can see how my skin just sucked it all in, in the little canyons."

So I thought this was really interesting 'cause when you look at your skin, you don't realize that. You're just a combination of little canyons. So the C60 definitely does absorb into your body and you definitely can feel it. So I wanted to share with you also the economics behind this. So for the third way of using C60 topically,"

That's 166 doses. And for the cost of C6 to this bottle from Red Lion, 162 bucks was shipping. It comes out to 98 cents a day. It has 98 cents per dose. So I normally take one to two tablespoons a day. And so to me, that'd be like two bucks,"

So for regular folks taking one tablespoon a day, it'd be like a dollar a day for the same amount of C60 that you would be having in a tablespoon of oil, right? We're talking quantities. So it's really inexpensive. I was really surprised how inexpensive this was. And compare that to olive oil. Now, if you took a look at the pricing guide, the most recent one I put out, the average cost per ounce of C60 olive oil is 10 dollars and 60 cents an ounce."

Compare that to dollar a day if you took it just directly, no oil. So it's interesting from an economic standpoint as well, in terms of making the decision to try it or not. Anyway, I did want to share lastly that there are some downsides. The downsides to taking pulverized C60 on your hands or I'm sorry on your skin is that it's just messy."

It's just messy. And so it's really easy to put too much out. And when you do, it's wasteful. It messes with your sleep if you take too much. And then there's this thing that Jay came up with. He calls it the Lucy effect."

And she just starts to activate more and more and more of her brain. That's kind of how he describes the feeling. I know what he means. I call it like sharpness, mental acuity. It's like, it's really hard to describe what happens when you take too much pulled ricey 60 on your skin. You get like this, you're in this zone thing and it's the Lucy effect. He calls it that I agree. Good term for it."

And lastly, you know, you're weird. And I didn't realize this part about my experiment. It didn't even occur to me, but, you know, here I am. I'm putting it on the back of my hand and then I'm going to my office, right? Now, you know, Jay's out in the tundra."

It's like a Monday and I got this smudge on my hand and people are looking at me like, \"Hey, so what's on your hand?\" And I'm like, \"Oh, yeah, I was just doing some stuff this week and I got some stuff on my hand.\" They're like, \"Oh, okay,\" and, you know, they're thinking, \"I got paint on me or something.\" And then the next day, they see me again, and then we say anything, and then finally somebody says, \"What's on your hand?\""

And so finally, finally, this is the kicker. So finally, on the fifth day, somebody finally looks at me and goes, \"What's on your hand?\" And I'm like, \"Oh, so I go, \"Oh, I do a science channel on YouTube"
