Elmer here and I just wanted to introduce you to the quick reference guide that I finally completed For the Leila Quantum Tech products the Quantum upgrade service and trom easy. This has been a long time coming It's taking quite a long time to put it together And I've spent a few hours with Philip going over it to make sure I've got as much information as accurate as possible So the one thing I do want to let you know about the quick reference guide It covers all of the products it covers all of the services"

There's a stronger version of the travel block There's a stronger version of the infinity block and of course with the infinity block as well"

They're stronger blocks You know, there's a lot of products out there now And so I just really wanted to kind of put all this information in one place and also the cards in terms of the product specifications By card so if you want to know how big it is what it weighs, you know, all that stuff How big the field is you know for everything? It's all right here in this quick reference guy now in terms of charging times again"

Okay, so that's just a capsule with five spheres These are the charging times using those capsules, you know for food, water, so forth and also to you can charge some stuff with cards So here's the information for that now the copying the frequency timeframes are right in here"

So pay attention to which block you have and here's your charging times Based on the type of block and again Here's where that sphere packet comes in so you can charge stuff with sheer packets And it's usually just ten minutes for everything, but and I kind of just try to keep the You know the way it's organized the same for every single table All right, so there's your charging times based on what device you're trying to use and we get into quantum upgrade"

There's a lot of nuances on you know How to set the you know the settings and things but bottom line though is you know basically it's like hey How big's that field size that is being you know the energy is being sent to you and obviously it's you know It's creating a field around you and how big that is Again, you know what your ranges are for Hawkins levels and what your ranges are for booster levels as they are now"

So here's that table. So kind of an example after 90 days Your booster level to get unlocked you can go up to 1400 for boosters and your daytime level goes up to 1200 So this is when you would get those those extra Features unlocked for you depending on how long you've been subscribed and of course those those gifs"
