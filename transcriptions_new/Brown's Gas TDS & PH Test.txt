I'm your host Kay Elmer and in this video I'd like to address something that popped up in our H2H HO telegram chat group recently where one of the members shared a pH test that he had done on his I believe is an awkward cure AC50 brownscast generator and it kind of raised quite a bit of questions from several members. I myself included and of course it compelled me to want to go ahead and test myself so I"
