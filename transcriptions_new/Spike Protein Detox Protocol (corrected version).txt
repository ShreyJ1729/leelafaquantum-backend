So for the protocol itself, it is a product that I recommend and I take myself which is Kirkham and 95 from Jarl Formulas and it's all Kirkham and you look at the ingredients"

So you got to be real careful about the, you know, the kind of the monkey around the words on you and they will sell you a turmeric making you think that it's Kirkham and it's not. This is all Kirkham and from Jarl Formulas, one bottle, 120 days, you take it twice a day, it's going to be 60 days for one bottle so you need to buy two to get through the protocol and so make sure you buy two of those and make sure you buy actual Kirkham. All right."

So for $102, you know, that's a pretty inexpensive way to detox, you know, these things out of your body, help people that you know are injured and stuff like that. So way lower than my first, you know, analysis and I'm, again, I'm sorry for the incorrect information in the first video."

So hey, this is what you would do, $102, do the protocol and help yourself feel better according to Dr. Proctor and Dr. McCollum and all the research that stands behind it. So there you go. Now I also want to just say thanks for watching the video, I really appreciate your patronage. You can find me and all the other stuff that I do at Tinkers.academy, you just type that"
