I'm your host Kay Elmer and in this video it's another installment on the series benefits of quantum healing with a focus on EMF which is electromagnetic frequency otherwise known as electro smog. So what I'd like to do today is share with you three separate studies that have been conducted on quantum energy as it relates to Wi-Fi exposure in human beings. They're fascinating"

So one of the first things that everyone should realize that EMF is radiation and it comes from everything. Everything from your appliances to cell phones to airplanes and you name it.
