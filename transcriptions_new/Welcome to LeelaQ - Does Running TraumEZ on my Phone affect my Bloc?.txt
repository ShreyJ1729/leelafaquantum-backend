Welcome to Layla Q or otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade. This is where we pluck out questions from our telegram chat groups. And either I'll answer them or I'll ask Philip Von Holshendorf, the owner operator of Layla Quantum Tech to get his take on what the answer is. And so this video is on the question. Does my phone running trom EZ affect my block, meaning it, you know,"

And if you're using it as a timer for copying and whatever and charging and you set it next to your block, is that going to interfere with the copying charging process? So here, let's listen to what Philip's take is on that question. Now, the next one here is the, the question was, is that running trom EZ while using a block for copying and charging stuff? We got, I got asked that question and I, and my guess was, well,"

So you should kind of keep it away from your block while you're using the block for copying and charging. And then people came back to me and said, but yeah, I'm using, but I'm using my phone as the timer. And it's right, it's right there on the table next to the block."

What are your, what are your thoughts? I know you probably haven't tested it, but what do you want to know? I have a clear answer to that. It's a great question and it's, it's, it's no problem to have the phone sitting relatively closed because it is not a"

But it's, you know, there's, there's no harm if you have it a little closer either. Okay. Well, that's good to know because I'm one of those people that I use my phone as my three minute timer. And the phone is literally like a foot away. And I never, I ever thought about it. And so someone brought it up and I'm like, Oh, yeah, that's a good point. Okay. So per fill up, it's not an issue."
