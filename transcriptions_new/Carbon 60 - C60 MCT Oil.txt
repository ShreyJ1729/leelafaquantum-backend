Well, the first benefit is it's very antimicrobial in terms of being able to fight off bacteria and viruses that help balance your gut flora and support your immune health. It provides clean, quick energy, especially to your brain when you take it and you will"

And lastly, there's some discussions out there that it may actually improve insulin sensitivity. So there's a lot of benefits to MCT as opposed to, let's say, just taking coconut oil by itself."

Well, MCT stands for medium chain triglycerides, which are fatty acids that have an aliphatic tail of 6 to 12 carbon atoms. And what that means is, and by illustration, is here's a diagram of the most common fatty acid found in coconut oil called lauric acid. It's comprised of two parts. The main part here, which is like the root of the molecule, is called the carboxyl group."

It's the number of them that determine whether or not, which is, it's a small, medium or long chain triglyceride. And so if it has 6 to 12 of these carbon atoms, it's going to be a medium chain triglyceride. Now, MCT oil is most often derived from coconut oil, but it's sometimes made from palm oil."

So what I'm going to do is take this and I'm going to make a third batch with it, but you can see how much less dark it is. It's definitely a lot less C60 in the flask, but there's C60 in there you can tell, right? You can see right there. So set that aside, finish up batch number two, filter this guy off. Here's my MCT that I bought, terra formulations, and then I'm going to pour this for my third batch now."

It looks like it needs more shaking right there, okay? That's the main thing though, make sure that nothing is stuck to the bottom because it'll stick to the bottom if you don't give it a good shake."

So this is batch number three now, the 250. And it's got, make sure all your 660's in suspension. And then there you go.
