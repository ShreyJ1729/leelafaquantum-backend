Well, first of all, you get it from a company called Red Lion and they're located in Ireland and from their website with how they describe their pulverized C-60 is they take C-60, they pulverize it in an inert atmosphere, millions of times pounded from about 60 to 70 hours. They claim that it's 100% water-free, there's no toluene, which is a toxin that uses as a region to try to extract it and most other"
