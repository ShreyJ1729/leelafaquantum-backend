I'm your host Kay Elmer and in this video I'd like to share with you the research that I've done on the idea of imprinting water. Now if you're someone who's interested in health and healing and performance and longevity then this video might be of interest to you because this is how you use water to achieve improvements in those areas. So first things first is really what is imprinting water? Well at the end of the"
