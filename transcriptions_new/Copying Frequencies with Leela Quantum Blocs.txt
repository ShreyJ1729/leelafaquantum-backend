This is a tutorial on how to copy frequencies using the Layla Quantum blocks. Now so I want to point out that there are other ways to do that with Layla tools. Primarily you can copy frequency with any of the blocks but you can also copy frequencies using the spheres that come with a capsule. So I'm only going to be talking about"
