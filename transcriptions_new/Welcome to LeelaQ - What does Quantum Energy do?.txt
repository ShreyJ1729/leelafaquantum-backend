All 42 kids improved in one way or another, and some improved a little, and other kids improved a lot like they started talking. You know, and so this was one of the most amazing studies that has ever ever come out was the actual study that shows quantum energy has a benefit on cognitive"

If you're familiar with Emoto, it's Masaru Emoto is literally, if you are into structured water or the study of water, his work on water that he started doing in the 70s is one of the most pivotal ground breaking work that's ever been done on the study of water in terms of cymatics and all of that.

This is the actual report from the Emoto Institute, where they took distilled water, they did it before, they did an after, and then they did an after, you know, at basically 10 minutes, they did another one for three minutes. And bottom line was they showed a distinct improvement in the crystalline structure of water. In other words, it's structure.

So they were looking at the blood and people who had it had their blood reacted a certain way that was not the same as people who didn't have it.
