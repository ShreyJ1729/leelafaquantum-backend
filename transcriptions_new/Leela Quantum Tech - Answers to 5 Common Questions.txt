I'm your host Kalmer and in this video I'd like to just cover five common questions that I get and see in the telegram chat groups for Layla Quantum Tech. I figured I'd just make a video so I can just link the video next time I get asked the question. So we're gonna be talking today about five of those common questions. One of them is about quantum healing, two overcharging and the copy effect, magnets and how they"

If you wanted to kind of take a look at you know like what is the human body comprised of and we're three really separate things that all combine into one being and that"
