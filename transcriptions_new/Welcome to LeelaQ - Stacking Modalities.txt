Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade. In this video, I'll be discussing the idea of stacking modalities with Philip Von Holtzendorf, the owner operator of Layla Q, in which we'll be discussing the combining of quantum upgrade and devices and/or combining devices for people who have questions about, you know, are they beneficial? You know, how do"
