And just for those of you who are not familiar with liposomal vitamin C versus vitamin C, I just want to point out that vitamin C is water soluble, which means when you take vitamin C as a capsule or a tablet, the efficacy rate or your ability to absorb the vitamin C is about 19% of it. And the other 81% of that vitamin C will just eliminate through your urinary tract. Okay, because it just, it just, you know, it's water soluble.
