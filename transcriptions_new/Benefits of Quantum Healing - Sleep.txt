I'm your host Kammer and this is another installment in the series benefits of quantum healing with a focus on sleep helping people attain better sleep getting to sleep faster and feeling more rested while they're sleeping and how does quantum healing work with that. So the first thing though is that unfortunately there have not been any studies that have been conducted by the Q in regards to this"
