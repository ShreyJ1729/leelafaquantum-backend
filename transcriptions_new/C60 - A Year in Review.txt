I did a whole video about this last year, but anyway, I digress So here's the study though, and I think it's really cool because now it's kind of got me interested like I'm pulling all but water soluble Alanine modified fullerene c60"

So they've taken florinols and they've basically did a study On how florinols affect stem cell generation right neural stem cells and the findings strongly indicate that the alla which stands for alanine modified fullerene c60"
