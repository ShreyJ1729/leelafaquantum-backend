I'm your host K Elmer and this video is another installment in the series benefits of quantum healing with this video specifically focused on how quantum healing can help with ADHD. However, I want to preface that there has been no studies done yet. We're very early in the process of understanding how quantum healing works with ADHD."

Because the basic concept to me and the idea here is that where there's a spark of hope, there's the light of hope as well. So it's kind of here's how things start in our community where people will tinker around and try different things to help family and friends and then they discover something and they share it with the community."

And that's how we help each other and collaborate to kind of spread this quantum healing, you know, throughout the community and to others. So no studies yet. We're very early in the process. But these are two testimonies that are so powerful that I wanted to share it with you to give you an idea of what the possibility could be for individuals suffering from ADHD."

It's a brain disorder that affects millions of American children and assured children worldwide that often last well into adulthood. The symptoms of this disorder are individuals with the inability or a lack of attention hyperactivity and impulse behavior."

The symptoms or the behaviors of that particular disorder is children who are uncooperative, defiant and aggressive. Okay. So that's what this video is about is how, you know, how do you help people with these issues using quantum healing."

This one was actually where someone had reached out to Layla Quantum Tech and said, \"Hey, you know, do you have anything for ADHD?\" And they actually created a frequency and it's been out there on the website for about a year now."

        "text": "And so we've only gotten some very early testimonies, which I'm going to share. But the idea was, is that Layla listened to the community and then created a frequency called the focus frequency. So if you go to the website, it's described as this and basically says this card, you know, the focus frequency is sold embedded onto a metal card."

This card could be used for many different reasons and it's been reported by many customers as a very positive and helpful. All right. Now, the important note about, and this is from the website now instructions from the website, the important note is that this card should be ideally worn for 24 hours in a row on the first day."

And then after that first 24 hours, the recommendation from the website, or Layla Q is a suggest only three to four hours per day for the next couple of weeks, you know, and then as needed. So that's kind of what the protocol has been kind of determined in terms of when they developed this frequency and they tried it out on some, you know, volunteers, and that's kind of what they came up with."

And now I want to also preface this as well because, you know, the frequencies that are embedded in cards can be copied onto foil using capsule spheres and or a block. And so you can actually add it to a capsule, or you could actually put it in the block and have it broadcast throughout the field. So there's different ways to apply this frequency."

But first, I want to caveat that these are really personal journeys that people have undertaken to help their loved ones and themselves. And so, you know, it is very personal and, you know, what may apply to one person may not apply to all of you. So, you know, we're, again, very early in the stage of understanding and really trying to see, you know, how can the focus frequency help individuals with ADHD and ODD."

But, you know, when you hear these stories, I think you're going to just, it definitely sparks, you know, a light of hope. So here we go. This is the first testimony. This was provided to me via direct message. So it's not actually in the public group. The next one is, but, you know, talking with Barbara L through telegram. This is her testimony. My grandson was assessed with ADHD and severe ODD when living with his mother. He was removed from her care over three years ago."

I had numerous complaints from the teacher last year in grade six. We had a great psychologist and psychiatrist change his medication, but complaints still came in. Teacher was concerned that while he was very bright, you know, he was very bright. His active behavior was a problem. He would struggle with changing classes and more pressure to work without direction to complete assignments."

He moved to a new school in a new town, now living with his father as of September 2022. There were some behaviors at the beginning of the semester. I put his picture in the travel block with the foil of the focus card and left it there."

He received student of the month award and his marks are in the 90s, and that's her story, and that is amazing. And so that's, you know, there's different ways to apply the focus frequency. It looks like she tried it two different ways, but placing a picture of him with a copy of the frequency on a piece of foil in a block."

First, whatever you do, never use the heal frequency in a card capsule or whatever, it makes the ADHD much worse. Second, get the focus frequency and wear it around your neck for six to nine months.

The focus frequency will have the opposite effect if you're using prescription ADHD medicines at the same time. Four, do not purchase the eye block as it'll make you more unfocused than usual. There are too many streams of consciousness active, and people with severe ADHD get very unfocused when all of those streams of consciousness get activated when near an eye block."

Clearly, the point of this video is that the focus frequency does something, and it seems like it does it very positively in the area of quantum healing for ADHD.

There's a way if you have the tools, you have the power to try to help them, and I do encourage everyone to do that. That's what our community is all about.

If you want to learn more about quantum energy, you can go to Leila Quantum Tech website, or you can come to my blog at Tinkers.academy, where I have a huge section dedicated to quantum energy. And so the links will be in the video description below. Again, thank you so much for your time. Thank you for all the kind comments you leave me. I truly appreciate this, and I wish you all the best and good healing for you all. Aloha."
