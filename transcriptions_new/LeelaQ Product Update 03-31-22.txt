You know, we've had a bunch of questions recently in the Telegram chat group about different products and about when things are gonna be available. And so I thought we would just get quick on the line with Philip and just ask some questions and just kind of see what's going on at Layla for all of you folks in the Layla community. So, welcome, Philip, how are you doing today?"

And so, you've mentioned a couple of posts that it's coming. Do you know, do you have any more information about when the, like the little travel quantum block is gonna be available? - I think the first batch we may have available in the end of April."

We're still figuring out some of the nuts and bolts of the quantum consciousness' levels. And we're gonna finish that up probably this week.

Is it, is it like, would you have you guys been able to measure the field? - Yeah, that's exactly what we're still fine-tuning right now to make a final decision on how strong we want to have it."

Like you would use a regular block? - That absolutely, you will be able to do, yes, 100%. And it's, and you have one, right? - I have the prototype, the smaller one. - Yep, and it's gonna be one centimeter larger"

Like, would you need to leave stuff in longer? I guess you're figuring that out, but I'm just assuming that because it's smaller,"

That it will be different like you like? - Most likely, it'll be a little bit different, but again, it depends on where we end up with, with the quantum consciousness level and the actual charge that will carry. And then, yeah, we'll make it available and we'll tell exactly, is this gonna be comparable now"

Sorry, I don't think more information I literally don't yet. - Oh, sure, yeah, maybe we can do a tutorial on that guy when he comes out, 'cause we just finished the one with the QB. Okay, so then on the opposite side of that spectrum is this now 12-inch, big thing, you know, big quantum block. Is it a big infinity block, right? The one that was, that one smoothie stores using? So it's basically a 12-inch by 12-inch infinity block, is that correct? - Yes, that's correct."

We may just have like 20 or 25 of these and then it's gonna be gone, we have to reorder, but maybe we'll do a pre-order for that as well in the beginning, but that one, we're set that we're gonna make this a regular product."
