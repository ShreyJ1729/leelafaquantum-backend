Welcome to Lele Q, otherwise known as Lele Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade. This video in particular is a discussion with Philip and I about high EMF environments, because that seems to be the topic of the days everyone has a concern about EMF. So what I did was, you know, I asked Philip specifically about what about, you know, like we"

What I wanted to ask you was, you know, in the idea of really high levels of EMF, people that are really living close to, you know, cell phone towers, people that are sitting inside, you know, EVs and electric vehicles and just really being irradiated. You know, there's all these different different levels of EMF and you literally could really be maxing out. And so that was the question I've got is that, you know, and somebody actually asked"

And my answer was no, because it really depends on the severity. And that's why there's different options for people, right? There's, you know, the traditional EMF mitigation has always been avoidance and then shielding. And then now because of Leila quantum tech, we've got this third option"

And then if you live in a higher EMF environment, what would you do next? And then, you know, and if you still have effects, you know, and you're still having problems, what would you do after that?

Maybe in addition, have your, your underwear or something like that. I think those are the situations where this comes in handy. But again, it doesn't just block EMF, it does a whole lot more.

If you, if you can't have your, you know, helping your biology with quantum tools, and if it's really severe, then, you know, next level up is shielding. So that's a really great recommendation.

And so even if you, you know, let's say, you know, like turn your Wi-Fi off at night, if you, let's just, you know, look on your phone, every one of your neighbors as Wi-Fi going, you know, so it really doesn't do much.
