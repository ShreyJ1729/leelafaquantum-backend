It's an unboxing of the super grand block that I got from Lillelle, Quantum Tech, for that frequency contest on the sleep and rest frequency. So I think this is pretty special because we just got noticed a couple of days ago from Philip that the super grand block has actually been redone"

So I got a square one so I think there's only a few of these prototypes made and I know that there's four of us at one of them in contests and who knows how many more they made but I think these are the only square ones there are. So going forward you kind of just take a look how big this thing is. This is going to be round and so now if you open the box there's going to be the rod."

You get the rods, you get the nuts, it's going to be round and then of course it comes with the little booklet. It says congratulations on buying your stuff and it's got the little table there but you can see where it says these are the different blocks and it doesn't mention the super grand block."

I'm going to get this out of here, here's one of the plates right there so take that out. This is what the unboxing looks like. I know you're all curious right because I'm always curious about unboxing."

So there's the two plates that put the box away for now so I've basically got the two different plates and the rods and the screws. So I'm going to go ahead and put the thing together. But this is what's been described so far for the super grand block which is it's going to be round."

But once this is assembled it's going to look like that over there which is my other grand block but that's a regular grand block. This guy's super, the strength of this block, the super grand block is supposed to be according to Philip's post on the Hawking scale 5600."

And you know it's kind of brand new to the market so we're really, nobody knows what that level of the Hawkins is going to do. It's pretty amazing. The other features obviously are these things have the harmony, the harmonizing feature and so forth."

But then if you put it in a block it still is this you know you can measure it again it's still the food but it's been changed its quantum potential has been changed and now it's no longer triggering allergies and negative reactions."
