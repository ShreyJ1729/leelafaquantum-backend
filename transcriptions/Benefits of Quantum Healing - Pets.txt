[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.280]   Kayelmer and this video is another installment in the series benefits of
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.460]   quantum healing specifically as it relates to pets. So what I'd like to
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.440]   share with you today is a study that was conducted by the Bess Institute and
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.760]   commissioned by Leila Quantum Tech back in 2021 and before I get into the nuts and
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.360]   bolts of the study itself I'd like to just kind of share with you a little bit
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.800]   about who the Bess Institute is and how they do their studies and then we can
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.600]   jump right into the actual way that the study was conducted. So first of all Bess
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.200]   Institute is kind of short slang for the International Association for Bio
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.340]   Energetic Systems Analysis or the IFV Bess. It's basically run by two
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.560]   individuals who are holistic practitioners and subject matter experts in bio
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.680]   energetics and these two individuals are pictured right here with Wolfgang
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.280]   Hans Albrecht and Eva Kranke and they are located in Austria in a town called
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.800]   Sophling Atase. Now what they do is they basically provide bio energetic systems
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.120]   analysis for clients throughout Europe and their services cover a wide range of
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.880]   industry from technology to agriculture and of course people and animals. So the
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.560]   concept of bio energetic systems analysis is a diagnostic method for
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.800]   determining the bio energetic status in the meridians and its subordinate
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.040]   structures such as metabolisms, organs, muscles, etc. Overall we're talking about
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.960]   the countless connections between the meridians and the morphogenic field or
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.300]   the quantum field within an individual or an animal and this is what makes Bess
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.360]   is so valuable in their diagnostics and their analysis. And what I'm talking
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.120]   about here is also known as meridian stress analysis or meridian stress
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.800]   assessment which was developed back in the 1940s when simply put the
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   concept of traditional Chinese medicines view of how energy flows through the
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   body through acupuncture points or also known as acupressure points within the
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.720]   body how energy and you know and the and the the orient called it chi or key
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.280]   energy the air vetics called it prana and in modern times it's called bio
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.840]   electrics but it's the idea that we are energy beings bio electric beings with
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.680]   all of this energy flowing all throughout us and these meridians are like the
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.600]   highways where this energy flows to all of the various areas of our body all the
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.840]   different organs and joints and so forth. Now what the Chinese figured out over
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.600]   2,500 years ago is how the bodies and all animals how they're mapped and where
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.120]   all those points are and where all that energy goes and that's called in today's
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.320]   world bio energetics and so what the Bess Institute does is they use a simple
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.280]   device and there's multiple different kinds of devices on the market that does
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.120]   this and actually the concept of meridian stress analysis or bio
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.440]   energetics analysis is practiced in Europe quite extensively there's over
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.480]   25,000 holistic practitioners and subject matter experts in Europe that
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.680]   actually practice this as a way to diagnose individuals and their problems
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.960]   and their issues and their challenges okay and it's it's actually in North
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.880]   America now but you'll mostly find this being used with holistic care
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.360]   practitioners and chiropractors and that sort of thing where they use this tool
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.920]   as a diagnostic to determine the condition of the other patient and so
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.040]   what it actually does from a technical standpoint this bio energetic systems
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.880]   analysis also known meridian stress analysis is it scans about 60 points
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.400]   along the surface of the skin with a small stylus that transmits a slight
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.480]   electrical current to the meridians of the body in order to measure the
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.680]   resistance to the electrical charge and it measures specifically 20 separate
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.240]   areas of the body to determine how well energy flows whether there's any
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.920]   resistance or impedance and what happens from one end to the other and based on
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.800]   literally what since 1940s is when this was kind of developed there's been
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.240]   what roughly 80 years of experience with all of these so different holistic
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.160]   practitioners using the device and determining exactly what the readings
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.560]   are and if it's whether or not it's healthy or it's not healthy or that sort
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.880]   of thing you know along these meridians to tell whether or not you know these
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.280]   areas of the body are in good shape or not and I'll get more into the specific
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.160]   details of what I mean by good shape so the 20 specific areas of the body that
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.520]   they measure in the study is everything here you see right here on the bottom
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.520]   of the slide which is they look at the lungs the skin the large intestine the
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.960]   stomachs the nerves the pancreas the blood circulation the gallbladder you
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.440]   name it limbs kidney liver or you know all of that stuff and every one of those
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.600]   things is measured to see how well energy is flowing through the body and
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.720]   from that the health of that individual or specifically in this case the health
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.680]   of the patient or which was an animal now when the when the devices are used
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.160]   in the bioenergetics are measured there's a color code so I kind of just want to
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.880]   stick with the color code for now and I'll get a little bit more into detail about
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.000]   that at the end of the study or I'm sorry at the end of this video but the
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.680]   concept here is that there's basically four colors and green is the optimum
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.320]   optimal energetic state this means you are healthy everything is running the
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.560]   way it's supposed to do it you're good you're good to go yellow is like you're
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.160]   you're in inflammatory stage or you're in inflammatory range where you know
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.960]   there may be cause for improvement blue indicates that it's a degenerative
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.960]   measuring range if you if you if the device the analysis tool registers in
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.040]   the blue range then there's definitely a problem that you've definitely got
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.080]   inflammation you've got blockages you've got possibly damage and so that's where
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.720]   it kind of just is able to measure that there's definitely you know it's a
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.600]   problematic state you know yellow is kind of like you know it's kind of like
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.680]   street lights right yellow is that you know hey you know alert alert but blue
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.680]   is definitely you've got issues and then read there's definitely damage and it's
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.080]   chronic and it's bad and so that's kind of how the the scale works when you're
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.760]   evaluating any type of mammal or human being with a bio energetic tool and like
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.160]   I said there's different mark tools on the market this one is actually
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.200]   proprietary to Bessah this is the device they use if you're interested in
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.080]   learning more about this there's other devices there's one called a deck of
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.360]   wall after Dr. Reinhard Ball who started this science there's also another device
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.680]   out there called Bioscand and you'll see these different devices being used by
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.680]   holistic practitioners in Europe and in America so now that's what you're going
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.720]   to see in the study and the study is like 62 pages so that's why I'm doing a
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.880]   video to kind of help you know kind of let's you know condense that 62 pages
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.300]   into a short video hopefully where I can kind of show you hey this is what they
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.300]   did and this is what happened okay so let's jump right into the study now the
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:10.780]   study itself is pretty simple they took several animals and they did a they
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:17.140]   did an analysis of their bio energetic system before you know any quantum
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:22.220]   devices were near them and then they did it afterwards and and the actual thing
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.740]   that they did was the Bessah Institute took a picture of the animal and placed
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.320]   it in an infinity block for 10 minutes and then afterwards they did the second
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.900]   analysis for that after snapshot so they did a before snapshot they put the
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.420]   photo in the infinity block for 10 minutes and then they did it after
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.780]   snapshot and here's a picture of me actually doing that myself I actually do
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.060]   this all the time where you know I will help people and animals and put them in
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.380]   the block and you're going to see what the results are from the study itself so
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.700]   this is kind of exactly what they did and you for me right here this little
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:00.300]   example is I also add frequencies but that's another subject so the concept
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:06.020]   here is before and after and they do an analysis both both times okay so the
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:13.140]   actual participants in the study there was eight there was three cats eight years
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:19.340]   old eight years old 18 years old very old cat number three Casper two dogs both
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.380]   one was eight years one was a puppy eight months two horses they had a
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.980]   gelding that was 27 years old that's pretty old for a gelding and decrepit
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.740]   state you know this here Casper was also in a decrepit state you know in in very
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:37.700]   old age but they had a mare that was 17 years so that's sort of like at middle
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.260]   age actually for a horse and then a goat Clara she was only three years old so
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.180]   they're the different eight different animals that were studied by the Bessah
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.380]   Institute using bio energetic analysis so now I'm going to walk you through the
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:55.540]   actual study itself so this is the study here by the way links to all of this in
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.740]   the video description below you go right to the study yourself you can read it
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:03.020]   again it's 62 pages so let me kind of just kind of zip through this study and
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.340]   get down into the actual results so you can just kind of see all of this
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.100]   information here is all about like what it's all about what the infinity is all
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.380]   about how they did the test what the procedures were and so forth so let's
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.740]   get into the first one and let's kind of walk you through quickly the eight
[00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.260]   different animals and specifically what they found with the eight animals so
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:26.180]   here's the first little kitty the kitty's name is a tomcat named Bubby and so
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.740]   Bubby was evaluated and when they did this analysis right here here's the
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.180]   sort of the summary then basically Bubby came out as all blue and as you
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.300]   can remember all blue means not in a good shape you know and so and then it
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.220]   was a little bit of yellow but mostly you know 100% was blue and then if you
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:46.940]   look at the rest of the actual readouts it goes breaks it down into lungs skin
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.340]   large intestine so when you take a look at this as a trained clinician you know
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.860]   evaluating all of the different markers and the results of each one of these
[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.500]   little markers you can kind of see the you know the length of the blue lines
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.100]   indicates the severity of the condition so you're in the blue zone
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.860]   right and this is how much you're in the blue zone in terms of nerves pancreas
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:12.380]   and so forth so the idea here is that if an animal or person is is measuring
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.300]   in the blue zone then they have issues and there's issues with this animal
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.980]   and so you can see that it's 100% blue everything across the board
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.740]   for Bubby the cat was blue when they measured him so then they put his
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.460]   picture in the infinity block and then 20 or 10 minutes later they did another
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.620]   assessment and after being exposed to quantum energy
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:37.100]   via quantum entanglement in an infinity block every one of his markers turned
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:42.060]   green which meant that it went from bad to good
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.740]   with just having that energy flowing through his his body
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.700]   and so you can see where now again they start measuring it
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.260]   and it's just you know you can see where it's just a little bit on the green
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.460]   side but it went from you know blue into the green
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.980]   and so now at that point they started the animal started to harmonize
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.620]   all of their energy flowing through all the different
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.380]   meridians in their body and all of their different organs started picking up
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.060]   in terms of more you know moving into that optimal state
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.460]   and so that's what happened with Bubby now the second cat here which is the
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.580]   cat was me is her name is Mia and the same thing
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.940]   you can see where Mia was at 100% in blue sorry
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:23.100]   here it is kind of hard to hold in and then every one of the different areas
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.740]   that they tested and all the different meridians and organs
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.780]   were all in a blue stage and then after they she was exposed to quantum
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:34.940]   energy 100% in the green so she went from blue to green
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.780]   and that's what's been happening and if you read the study
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.620]   every one of the animals here's the older cat that tomcat that you know
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.980]   was I believe 18 years old or 17 years old cast bar
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:51.020]   same thing with him and he went and he was evaluated 100% in the blue
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.100]   and then switched over 100% in the green okay
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.940]   and then we go into the dogs this is the dog Sammy
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.460]   Sammy was evaluated now he was not 100% blue
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:07.820]   he was you know but again he was 90% blue or 95% blue
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.420]   5% green and then he and all of his different readings
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.060]   came out like that like the other one and then once
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.380]   after he was exposed to quantum energy they re-measured him and he showed up
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.900]   100% green and then we go into the next dog and this is the
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.820]   really old dog Felicita in quote the decrepit state
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.780]   poor little girl and so she came out and obviously she
[00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.860]   was she was just 97% blue 2% green and then after 10
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.900]   minutes in the infiniti block she pops out at 100% green
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.980]   so a really great improvement of course you've got your horses again
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:47.500]   all blue and then I believe this was the mayor and then after that all green
[00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.700]   and then lastly you've got I believe this was the gelding
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:55.500]   the older gelding old man old man came in 100% blue
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.420]   and look how and look you can see how much farther the bars are in terms of just
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.980]   you know the because the ravages of old age right
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.340]   I feel his pain and so he's just really really having a
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.180]   hard time really got so you can see where he's got
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.020]   issues with small intestines blood circulation this is actually how
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.060]   holistic doctors using this analysis will determine
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.780]   what do you need to work on first which one's worse
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.980]   and then start prescribing care right so you can see where this horse was
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.140]   definitely having issues with blood circulation and in a small intestine
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.380]   however 10 minutes in the infiniti block and all of his energetics
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.620]   switch to green and he brings himself into an energetic state
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.980]   into into a healing state and then lastly the goat
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:42.300]   this was the goat Clara and when she walked in or when she first started her
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.180]   test 100% blue and then after 10 minutes in the
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.740]   infiniti block then Clara shows up at 100% green
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.660]   and that's the results and so let's talk about what those results mean
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.020]   so everybody as you can see or all I mean everybody all the animals started
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.380]   off as blue and so this was the actual this is actually in the study in the
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.340]   just you know in the in the interpretation section
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:07.420]   of the study and so basically it says measured values from below 50 to around
[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.580]   zero represent the so-called degenerative measuring range
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:16.460]   or a lack of energy as a reaction to the stimulus of the system by
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:21.180]   corresponding environmental signals okay so I think
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:26.860]   in summary is right off the bat if 100% of the respondents
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.860]   the test subjects of the study measured in the blue
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.700]   and it's an and it's essentially signaling that all the animals
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.420]   were under some form of energetic stress from their environment
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:44.060]   and I think and I'm just going to stretch that out and say I think we all are
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.820]   because we all live in a fairly toxic environment
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.500]   either from electro smog and or all the chemicals in our environment
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:57.100]   if you think back literally 150 years ago there was no electro smog
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.460]   and there were no poisons and chemicals in our environment
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:04.220]   I mean unless you had a job like digging coal you were not exposed
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.340]   you know to toxins every single moment of your day
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.020]   and in our environment today because of what's coming out of the sky
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.620]   what's in the water all those forever chemicals
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.020]   what's in the food you know the processed foods
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.780]   so and and of course EMF which is horrendous and you can't get away from
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.380]   it now from the satellites so right now what's what's kind of nerve
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.100]   racking is that these studies are showing when measuring
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.700]   the bioenergetics of animals right specifically animals
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.300]   I think is profound because animals there's no placebo effect
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.220]   but it's measuring that there is definitely a lack of energy
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.060]   or weakened bioenergetic energy level
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.420]   within all the ingredients of the animals body
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.620]   and it's corresponding to their environment okay so we're all
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.620]   basically in in a weakened energy state so then when you start saying well
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.860]   okay what's this you know what's the result
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.700]   of quantum energy what's the benefit of quantum healing
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.740]   when it comes to this situation that we're all living in
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:06.940]   as in a bioenergetic state and so the interpretation of
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.300]   the green means that the measured value of 50 on the test
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.820]   marine represents an optimal energetic state
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:17.260]   in this organ or it's subordinate and subordinate levels
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.380]   also measured in the value range of 50 to max
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.220]   70 still counts as now you know as neutral and balanced energy status
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.580]   the bottom line the organism is able to regulate
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.260]   irritations of the system the wrong environmental system
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:36.620]   signals very well so first point right we're all
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.380]   walking around in a weakened state because of our environment
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.500]   however in the presence of quantum energy
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.580]   what this study demonstrates using eight different animals
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:52.780]   across 61 you know 60 days using the infinity block is that when you're
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.540]   in this in the in the presence of quantum energy and this could be
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:01.020]   either by placing your your photo in a block or being really close to the
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.060]   block in your home or having you know subscribing to the
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:07.260]   u-service for the pet service for the quantum upgrade
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.620]   it's pretty much going to be providing you with that that
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:14.220]   you know bathing you in that energy that positive quantum
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.780]   energy and what does that do it brings you it essentially as demonstrated by
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:24.540]   this study it reverses the the weakened energy state
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:29.100]   and it puts your body into an optimal energy state
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.620]   so that's you know and that's from just looking at it from a bioenergetic
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.700]   standpoint so what I'd like to also add in summary
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.220]   so you know that for this you know for this study is that
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.540]   when I was researching for this video and I started to look into the work of
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.300]   Dr. Reinhard Vol who like I said earlier it was
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.340]   one of the pioneers for meridian stress assessment
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:55.340]   no he invented the technology he did all the study on Chinese traditional
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.740]   medicine he learned everything about acupuncture and
[00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.180]   acupressure and then he married that with technology
[00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.380]   and he did all of his different studies and all and some of the studies that he
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.780]   did to understand you know how he could use
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.660]   technology to do the same thing that these
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.580]   traditional acupuncturists did but having a device that could actually do
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:19.420]   the diagnostics for him so that he could then create a treatment plan
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:24.300]   right what's when he would measure between the acupuncture points let's say
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.300]   of any particular you know meridian within the body so let's say the
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.580]   spleen meridian right and he would literally have this device it would
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.900]   send a very very very tiny electrical current
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.340]   from one end of the meridian to the other end and he would measure
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:44.220]   electrically whether or not the amount of energy being put into that meridian
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:47.820]   and then what came out and what he discovered and he did this
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.140]   you know in the 40s so over the course of decades he discovered
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.580]   that three things were either going to happen it'd be the same amount of energy
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.020]   coming out which meant that you were in an optimal state you know your
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.300]   your highways clear you can get from one end of the other really fast
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.580]   you know and it's like if you're a river there's no beaver dams i mean it just
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.660]   flows you've got really good energy it comes in and it comes out the same
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.700]   level and that's how he measured it but when he measured
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.700]   that if there was energy coming in and more energy coming out
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.580]   and then he would study you know and of course he would evaluate the patient
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.220]   he discovered that they that the patient was
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.060]   in an inflammation state or a damaged state or a stress state
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.460]   specifically they were in a stressed state and then if he actually measured
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.820]   less energy coming out right the three different things that could happen
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.380]   if there was less energy coming out than going in
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.900]   then when he would do the analysis and and and diagnose the patient
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.020]   he discovered that that patient had damage actually were
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.260]   in a chronic state and so that's kind of how all it is developed right and and
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.780]   the wording that Bessie uses they don't get into that whole electrical
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.740]   measurement standpoint but they you know they're but their technology does the
[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:57.420]   same thing and so what i'm trying to say is that
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.660]   the way that Bessie stipulates that this is an optimal
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.740]   energy state if you were to research for if you were look at the doctor vol
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:09.180]   results and how he interpreted it the same concept
[00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.220]   but he would say that and and he would he would say based on his research
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:19.100]   that green is a healing state and blue is a
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.700]   basically a stressed state and green is damaged
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.700]   and the idea of what this study demonstrates and what's so profound
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.220]   about this to me is that the benefits of quantum
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.100]   healing not only assisted these animals
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.860]   mitigate the negativity of their of their environment from an energetic
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.500]   standpoint and it became positive but not only did that happen
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.260]   but they also were elevated into a healing state
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:49.340]   and that and why that's so important for our bodies is that the whole concept of
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.940]   holistic medicine is helping the body heal itself
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.660]   but if you're if you're in a weakened state
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.780]   and you don't have the enough energy for your body to help itself
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.860]   then of course you can imagine how hard it is to to get over issues and problems
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.260]   and challenges disease and so forth but to be elevated into a healing state
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.980]   is the first goal that's literally the first
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.780]   objective of any holistic practitioner is to bring your body up to a level
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:17.180]   where your body can start to heal itself
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:21.260]   and then you provide a treatment plan for how you can assist your body
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.740]   help itself better and so that's what's amazing to me is that this study
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.580]   shows that there's a distinct measurable
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.980]   I mean using uh you know bio-electric or bio-energetic scanning
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:38.940]   marine stress assessment diagnosis was able to prove that this was
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.620]   actually physically happening by simply subjecting
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:46.700]   the participant to quantum energy and so
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.140]   that's the findings of this study I find it really remarkable
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.340]   there are other studies out there that were done on humans in the exact same
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.860]   way I'll be doing those next that'll be in the next video
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:01.100]   or two I got I got like a whole bunch loaded you know loaded up ready to
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:05.260]   kind of research but that was the study and so now again
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:09.100]   the study is available link below it's on Leila Q's website
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.380]   it's it's a fascinating read and it's really just quite amazing
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.420]   in terms of like you know what are the benefits of quantum healing
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.460]   and as it relates to pets they're pretty amazing
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:23.260]   and uh and you know what I'm I'm just amazed by this and I think it's just
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.380]   fascinating and there's a lot more studies on the website so if you'd like
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.580]   to learn more about quantum energy you can
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.060]   please I'll put the links in the video description below
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.300]   go visit Leila Quantum Tech or you can come visit me at the Tinkers Academy
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.740]   where I have a large section of my blog dedicated to quantum energy
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.940]   so thank you for spending some time with me today to learn about quantum
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.300]   healing as it relates to pets I appreciate your time and I really
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.820]   appreciate your kind comments thank you very much and I hope this was
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.820]   beneficial to you Aloha
