[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and in
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.400]   this video, it is another installment in the series benefits of quantum healing. Now, what I've
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.640]   done on these videos is just sharing the testimonials that are coming from the telegram chat groups,
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.200]   as well as the studies that Leila Quantum Tech has commissioned to demonstrate the effectiveness
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.520]   of the quantum energy devices, as well as the quantum upgrade service. So recently conducted in
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.440]   March of 2023 and recently published is a new study now called quantum upgrade and its effect on
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.400]   sleep. So I wanted to share those results with you of the study so you can understand a little bit
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.400]   more about how quantum upgrade and quantum energy helps with sleeping. So now this study was commissioned
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:53.200]   by Leila Quantum Tech with a company called Biostrap Labs. Now what Biostrap Labs is is they're a
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.720]   company that essentially sells Fitbit type devices. And then on top of doing that, because their
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.000]   entire business model is wrapped around biometric measuring and things like that that, you know,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.240]   like Fitbits and Chora rings and that sort of thing, these biometrics sensors are devices you
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.800]   can wear that just basically track all your different, you know, vitals, basically. And then, you know,
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.320]   a lot of athletes use it, a lot of performance-based individuals, biohackers and so forth use these
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.360]   devices to really keep track, you know, and dial in on exactly how they're doing on a bunch of
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.960]   different metrics. And so now Biostrap sells devices but they also conduct studies. And so Leila
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:40.400]   Quantum Tech hired this company to conduct a study using their equipment and their customers,
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.560]   you know, selected at random to see how did quantum upgrade affect their sleep. And so now it's a
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.600]   pilot study. So pilot meaning the very first one just to kind of see like, is there anything
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.360]   happening there? And then, you know, it's small. And then if they do find that there's a measurable
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.400]   result, then usually that kind of encourages people to do more studies, right? So they kind of just
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.320]   start out with the small pilot. Now this was done again in March of 2023. The title of the study is
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.320]   called the investigation of quantum upgrade and its effect on sleep, physiological and psychological
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.120]   parameters. There we go. Now the overview is that they selected four individuals at random
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.120]   and the study was conducted over a six week period of time. The data collection methods
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.280]   included comprehensive biometric measurements, daily questionnaires, and intermittent surveys.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.320]   So one of the things I do want to share with you, there's actually a document is initially
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.960]   created whereby all of the parties involved kind of understand what is the structure of the study.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.520]   And then there's another write up of the results of the study. So this document right here, and by
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.840]   the way, all the links are in the video description below. But this document right here is just the
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.400]   general study information. Just so you kind of understand, even though there was four people,
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.000]   and it sounds really small, like, oh, you know, there's only four. However, the difference between
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.880]   this approach and let's say just people doing it themselves and doing testimonies,
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.080]   while it's incredibly beneficial and every individual's personal experience is valuable and please
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.560]   share, you know, that's one of the things about our telegram chat group is to really encourage
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.200]   sharing your experiences so that others may learn from you. And then these studies on the side are
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.560]   being commissioned to demonstrate in a clinical setting using incredible a lot of structure and
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.960]   clinicians to follow up and make sure the data is collected and the process is followed is really,
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.280]   really important because it really sets that baseline, you know, in terms of like, hey, you
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.840]   know, if this was done in a scientific setting, you know, then what are the actual results and those,
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.800]   and those actually then will go and back up the claims that are made by Layla Quantum Tech.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.440]   So you can read in this study information, this general study information document,
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.600]   which was how the study was structured. So the bottom line is I just wanted to share with you
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.360]   just the level of detail that was involved here in terms of like the data collection methodologies
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.360]   in terms of they're using biometrics, they're doing surveys, they're measuring things like stress
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.720]   and the mood states of the individual, their sleep quality and their satisfaction, you know,
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.360]   which is how that's going. And they're doing daily surveys and longitudinal metrics and they're
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.720]   measuring all of these different things of these four individuals over the six week period of time.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.160]   And so kind of just to kind of share with you just basically the study design, how it was conducted,
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.120]   again, it was just two weeks of just doing nothing but biometric measuring, and then three to four
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.760]   weeks more, you know, a total of six weeks by which they were exposed to quantum upgrade and they
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.200]   continued to measure all of the various, you know, biometrics. And so the individuals were then
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.680]   measured, they were measured on heart rate, heart rate variability, oxygen saturation,
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.880]   respiration rate, sleep time, light sleep, deep sleep, awake time, arm movements, and basically
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.520]   there's bio slap, bio, sorry, bio strap, sleep score, say that three times less. Okay, and so
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.080]   that's how they did it. So now these are just an example of the questionnaires that the participants
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.120]   were asked to do. And then they measured their sweet sleep quality index. And so they were looking
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.200]   at everything from, you know, can you get to sleep quickly? Can you wake? Do you wake up in the
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.800]   middle of the night? You have to go out to bathroom in the middle of the night, breathing, coughing,
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.920]   too cold, too hot, dreams, pain, anything else that involved their sleep. So you can see that
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.560]   there's a lot of detail involved. And then of course they had to do a survey about how they felt
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.040]   do they feel rested, they feel calm, they felt like, you know, lonely, you know, irritable,
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.960]   all that kind of stuff was all collected by these clinicians. So you can see that it's a very
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.720]   scientific structured approach. So even though it's a pilot of four people, what's really,
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.800]   really important here is the level of detail and data collected by bio strap in the study to kind
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.840]   of determine whether or not when they say in general, you know, that there is any type of result,
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.720]   you'll know that the results are the product of a detailed evaluation of an individual's use of
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.080]   the quantum upgrade service. And they're measured with these devices, biometric surveys, you know,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.000]   biometric devices and surveys and questionnaires all at the same time over the six weeks. So it's
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.600]   quite a lot of work that was conducted just to see, hey, you know, what was the results of having
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.360]   quantum upgrade? So now the study design and methods. Now it just just want to go over like,
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.400]   what are we talking about here? So what bio strap did was they went to their own customer base,
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.520]   selected four people at random that volunteered to be in part in this measurement group. Okay,
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.320]   the individuals were 25 to 55 years old, male and female mixed up and didn't get into the specifics.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.360]   And then each one of them had been a consistent customer and using the bio strap device for
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.320]   over three months already. And they all lived in the United States. Now the methodology employed,
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.160]   and I think this is what's really important for all of you that have quantum upgrade and want to
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.400]   see if you can duplicate the results of the study was the first thing was that they just did a two
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.080]   week baseline without Okay, that's something that you would have to, you know, if you wanted to
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.840]   replicate this, you just turn it off for two weeks, and then turn it on over the next over four more
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.440]   weeks to if you wanted to replicate study. So what these participants had done was they turned on
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.200]   quantum upgrade for these individuals, the quantum upgrade was activated and was running for 24
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.520]   hours a day seven days a week for those additional four weeks, right? And then the day setting was
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.760]   set at 600 for the first two weeks, and then set the 700 thereafter and left at 700. Okay,
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.680]   the night setting was set at 500, and they were running it with the inner piece frequency. Okay,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.120]   so that's what's really key here. It was not just quantum upgrade, but they were actually,
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.800]   you know, basically being sent or the entanglement was also being sent the inner piece
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.520]   frequency at night while they were sleeping. And so now the summary of findings here, and this is just
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.400]   the overall quote right out of the study, the results suggest that the exposure of quantum
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.880]   upgrade had potential benefits for certain physiological and psychological aspects,
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.600]   notably resting heart rate showed consistent improvements in three out of four subjects,
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.720]   indicating a potential calming effect. Additionally, improvements in oxygen saturation and sleep
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.480]   quality were observed in some participants. So in other words, bottom line, it helped. Okay,
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.120]   and let me show you the detail by which it helped. So if we go back to the study and we go to the
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:28.400]   actual results, we take a look at the individuals, and this is the area here where they're talking
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.120]   about the summary of findings. I just read that to you. And then they get into subjects. And each
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.120]   one of these individuals will were individually, obviously, you know, individually measured,
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.320]   individually tracked. And then so here's the 42 year old male participant. And just to kind of,
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.360]   I won't read the whole thing to you. If you want to read it, click on the link below in the
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.800]   description. But the resting heart, heart rate of this individual demonstrated improvement,
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:57.040]   oxygen saturation was improved, deep sleep, they basically subject experience substantial
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.960]   increase in deep sleep duration. And their overall sleep score is significantly improved by 8.4
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:09.440]   points. Now subject two was a 62 year old female participant with a resting heart rate was
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:16.800]   increasing, breaths per minute increased, sleep score went basically a seat, declined to sleep
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:22.800]   score during the intervention with a slope. So this individual, their sleep score went down 0.46 points,
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:28.640]   but and then in measurement of fatigue, basically, this individual continued to trend upwards during
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.720]   the intervention, increasing. So this individual kind of went in a different direction. But it's
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.280]   important to note that data trends may have been influenced by several abnormal days
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.600]   during the intervention, the deviations from the norm could potentially be attributed
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.560]   to an external life stressors or habits, which is actually mentioned. So I want to kind of point
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.960]   out one other thing in the study, which says, however, it's important to knowledge that individual
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:01.360]   differences experience differences and subject to faced basically a life event. And it was influenced
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.000]   by an external life event. So they didn't say what exactly happened to this. But if you'd imagine if
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.040]   something really significant happened in your life and major loss, you know, anything kind of,
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.080]   it's going to disrupt your sleep irregardless of what you're doing at the time. So this individual
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.200]   did incur a life event during that, but they didn't want to kick her out of the study. But it's
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.760]   real interesting to see how, hey, you know, if you're going through some like a really tough time,
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.600]   you know, it's going to affect the way that the quantum helps you. And it's going to affect your
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.440]   sleep. But you know, what's we don't know is what it would have been if she hadn't experienced that
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.120]   negative effect. But here we go. Subject number three, a 20 year old male participant. Now this
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:46.080]   individual basically resting heart rate during the intervention period, which means the four weeks
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.560]   with QE was turned on was lower. The number of steps on this individual was basically averaging
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.400]   more steps than they normally did. So they're more active during the four weeks. And then in
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.600]   terms of their focus, it, it decreased slightly. And then on the mood increased approximately
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.000]   1.19 points during the intervention. So, you know, this individual said, Hey, my mood's important,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.800]   my mood's improving. My focus is not really on on type, but I'm more active. And the resting
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.040]   heartway was really good. And so bottom line is subject three experienced during the intervention
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.600]   was characterized by mixed results. Positive changes included a lower resting heart rate,
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.480]   increased daily step account as noted. But bottom line knows that this individual was kind of like,
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.320]   yeah, it helped a little bit, but not, not significantly, not like subject number one.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.920]   And then of course subject number four was a 33 year old female. And she was involved with
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.120]   her resting heart rate, was basically lower, lower frequency heart rate variability,
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.320]   which was lower is better, if you know. And then of course fatigue, basically overall fatigue had
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.360]   decreased approximately 2.25 on the 10 point scale. So this, you know, which is interesting,
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.760]   because subject four has experienced the intervention phase appear to be characterized by a calming
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:12:00.080]   effect, notably, you know, the physiological reaction, such as lowering heart rate and sympathetic
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.720]   nervous system activity, which is your heart rate variability score, was observed during
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.520]   intervention, it reduced, okay, which is a good thing. And then of course, fatigue decreased. So,
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.680]   those were that's really what happened with all four individuals. But overall,
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:19.200]   the summary was, Hey, you know what, it appears to help. It definitely affected all four of them.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.760]   That's what's really key here. They definitely were feeling something. And when measured along
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.200]   all of those different metrics, the overall kind of like, if you average it all out and summarize it,
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.800]   you know, the sleep quality was improved overall. And actually overall, all of them actually were
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:40.560]   calmer and, and, and, you know, basically showed improvements and breathing and heart rate and so
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.920]   forth. So, you know, it's kind of like a pilot. These are the actual results. The full transparency
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.640]   here, at least I'm going to, you know, again, the link to the study is included here. But I wanted
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.080]   to point this out because it's, you know, every one of these studies is just amazing. For the very
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:02.160]   fact that we're talking about quantum energy being sent to someone via entanglement from a far
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.840]   distant location, and it's actually having a physiological and psychological effect on people.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:13.280]   And in most cases, unless there's, you know, something going on, you know, those, those effects
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:19.040]   are actually being accepted by the body and by the person in a very positive light. And things do
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.520]   improve. So I think that's what's really coming out of this pilot study. And I think this is what's
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.040]   really amazing about any of the studies is that we continually see study after study after study,
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:34.160]   some incredible positive results that clearly I just wanted to share with you. So now if you are
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.840]   a quantum upgrade user, I kind of want to go to my dashboard and kind of show you real quick
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.720]   on how, you know, on basically what you would need to set your settings for to kind of replicate,
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.720]   you know, the study and actually, if you want to get these types of results yourself.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:55.040]   So here's my dashboard for myself. And right now, I'm not using any boosters right now, not today.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:00.560]   But here's the thing that I thought was interesting was, you know, my definition of daytime up until
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.120]   I read this study is I hadn't really thought about the way that the study looked at it. My
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:10.800]   interpretation of quote daytime was, you know, what I would call my workday versus my personal day,
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.960]   right? So your workday is like, you know, eight to eight or, you know, eight to five,
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.440]   whatever. And then after that, it's my quote nighttime. But in this study, though, it was like,
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.960]   hey, daytime was defined by when they're awake. And nighttime was when they were asleep. So I
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.760]   think one of the key things here is to kind of really think about, Hey, what is your daytime?
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.520]   Like, are you measuring it against how you would consider your work hours, and then your family
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.560]   hours, right? Or are you measuring it like, Hey, I'm awake versus I'm asleep. And so if I were to
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:46.240]   kind of wanted to do this study, then I would really need to kind of change this. I'd say basically,
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:54.640]   11, I'd go 1159 PM, right? Because I'm basically awake from eight to midnight, excluding naps.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:02.160]   And then, and then set this thing at 700, set my hawken score at 700 is 700 right, right? There
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.720]   we go. And that's kind of what, you know, this, the study was done. And then setting the 500.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.040]   Now I have my nighttime on pause right now, but I would definitely take the pause off, set it at
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.640]   500. And then with my frequency, it turned the frequency on green is on grays off. And then I
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.040]   would basically turn on inner piece. Okay. And then I would go ahead and click update. And then
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:26.720]   that's how I would activate the parameters of the study. So easy peasy, right? Now one of the things
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.400]   I do also want to mention though, is that there's an actual, as I noted in the very first benefits
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.680]   of quantum healing video on sleep, which was all about the products, you know, the physical products,
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:43.520]   using that for sleep. There's an actual frequency card out there called calm and rest. And so people
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.240]   can buy that card now. Unfortunately, it's not included in quantum upgrade right now. But I did
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:55.280]   talk to Philip and he's going to be adding the calm and rest frequency in the first quarter of 2024.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.120]   So, you know, beyond the lookout for that is something you might want to try. If you're, you know, if
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.200]   you're, you know, kind of struggling or you want to improve your sleep quality and that sort of
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.600]   thing, definitely, you know, I would say is try the parameters within the study like I just showed
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.520]   you and are coming in the first quarter, they'll be calm and rest. So if you've got the frequency
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.320]   bundle, you know, that's your time to really kind of give that one a try and see how that one works.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.880]   Now from a physical standpoint, people have been using that card for for a long time now. It's
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.120]   been available since day one and they find a lot of help, you know, putting that card under their
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.600]   pillow. So for quantum upgrade right now, the frequency you'd want to use is inner piece.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.560]   And the idea behind that is coming next quarter, you might be able to want to, you know, you might
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.720]   want to switch over to calm and rest and see how that one helps you. But there you go. At the end
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:46.160]   of the day, quantum upgrade has definitely shown a distinctive influence on people's lives
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.000]   all up and down the scale by any which way you could measure it. And I think it's in a very
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.080]   positive light. And so I just wanted to share that with you and thank you for your time today
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.240]   and watching this video. Now, if you want to learn more about quantum energy and quantum upgrade,
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.480]   I'll link to the website below for quantum upgrade. There's tons of information and the
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.240]   research studies now this study just came out. So it's not on the website yet. But if you want to
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.560]   read it again, you know, link in the video description below. Now, any if you want to reach me, I'm here
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.480]   at the Tinkers Academy blog, where I basically do all sorts of different types of videos and
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:19.120]   tutorials and things like that on quantum healing and so forth. And so if you want to find me link
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:25.040]   below, and I also have a huge section just on the quantum healing aspect of, you know, health and
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.120]   healing. So on my blog, and you're more than welcome to come and visit me there. So anyway,
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.160]   thank you very much for watching this video. Hope it was helpful and educational. And I'll have,
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.200]   I wish you a happy day and great sleep. Aloha.
