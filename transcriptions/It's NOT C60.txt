[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   Aloha, everyone, and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me,
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.720]   Kay Elmer, and in this video, let's talk about C-60 products that are not C-60
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.960]   products. What do I mean by that? Well, let's get into it. So first things first, I
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.960]   just want to do a little quick disclaimer that this is just my humble
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.200]   opinion, like all my other videos I just share. I learn, I just have an
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.720]   insatiable curiosity to learn, I read a lot, and I just am gonna share, and this
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.840]   is how I share, so I make videos. All right, so I really want to make it very
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.920]   clear that I have no affiliation with any C-60 company, I'm not an affiliate, I
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.240]   don't make it and sell it, nothing. I don't even make referrals, I make no
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.760]   money. Nogana, Nyon, Santavo, Con estos avidios. All right, so, and then the other
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.440]   thing I really want to make sure everyone's really clear about, because we kind of
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.920]   like have been doing this for a while, in terms of like taking C-60 as
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.560]   supplements, or those of us that are doing it, I mean, I think I'm on four or
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.800]   five years now, I don't know, but you know it's like C-60 is still experimental,
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.240]   you know, I don't have anything really nice to say about the FDA, but it's not
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.000]   FDA approved, whatever that means anymore, but you know what, it is
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.640]   experimental. We are the human trial, there have been no trials of C-60 on
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.800]   humans, right, that have been published, and I know that there have been some that
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.480]   are underway, you know, Ken Schwartz over at Purple Power has mentioned that in
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.560]   his videos, but so far nothing, right, so we are the human trial, there are no
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.200]   studies that say what is C-60 going to do to a human long-term, but this is the
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.440]   thing about this video and the products in this video, is that you know what, this
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.080]   other stuff is very experimental, so if you think C-60 is experimental, yeah, let's
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.480]   go talk about this other stuff, and you know what, I'm just, I'm not picking on
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.040]   anybody, I just wanted to use these as an example to kind of educate the C-60
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.760]   community, or if you're out there taking C-60, you're interested in C-60, there is a
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.000]   huge difference between C-60 and not C-60, let's talk about the first couple, so
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.600]   now the first thing I want to point out is anything that's calling themselves
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.120]   water-soluble C-60 is not C-60, here's a couple of examples, there's this new
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.920]   product out there, it's been around, I think about a year and a half, called
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.800]   water-soluble EON, C-60, you got some great videos and all that stuff on YouTube,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.400]   then there's this other one, that's from Nanogenesis Labs, and then there's this
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.040]   other product called Champion C-60, water solution concentrate from youth
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.800]   eternal supreme, so these are two products that have C-60 in the title, but
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.920]   they're not C-60, so what are they then? Well let's take a look at the literature,
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.560]   one of the things about the literature about what is a water-soluble C-60, so
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:46.440]   if we talk about water-soluble and the words and the molecule C-60, then the
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.280]   first thing that everybody should know, if you don't know already, is that C-60
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.640]   does not dissolve in water, that's why everybody puts C-60 in oil, and you're
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.400]   getting it and all sorts of different kinds of oils, everything from MCT to
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.840]   avocado, olive, you name it, right, it's all over the matte pumpkin seed oil, I've
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.480]   seen it in CBD oil, it's all over the market, all sorts of different oils, and
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.160]   that's what they do, and that's called lipofluorines, because it's, you know,
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.120]   basically dissolved, excuse me, dissolved in oil, so because it won't dissolve in
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.280]   water, it's, but how do you make it dissolve in water? So if we take a look at
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.960]   this study, an analysis of binding between water-soluble C-60 derivatives,
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.560]   and then of course they go on to talk about how do you, you know, if you did
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.480]   that, you know, if you change the C-60 molecule, make it a derivative of a C-60
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.000]   molecule, then, you know, there's some quite really, really interesting and
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.120]   promising attributes of these different molecules that they're creating, and
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.920]   that's what this study for, by the way, everything that I'm sharing in this
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.520]   video is going to be in the video description below, all the studies, you
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.920]   know, knock yourself out if you want to research further, but this is really
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.280]   what I, this is the point I want to make, okay? I'm not going to read this to you,
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.960]   it's just like 21 pages, but I like to use the diagrams, so here we go, what is a
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.960]   water-soluble C-60 molecule? Well, it's a C-60 molecule that has other
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.480]   molecules and/or other atoms, additional atoms, attached to it, so that it becomes
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.080]   a different type of molecule, it's a derivative of a C-60 molecule, but it's
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.800]   no longer C-60. You cannot attach anything to a certain, to a particular
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.160]   molecule, which in the scientific phrasing, a C-60 molecule is called
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.680]   pristine because, you know, it's just, it is what it is, but if you start
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.000]   attaching stuff to it, then you're going to, it's actually the terminology for
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   that molecule becomes, quote, C-60 derivatives, and certain derivatives
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.080]   actually have names, like full and also cover that in a second, all right? So it
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.560]   kind of gets complicated, I'm not a chemist by any means, I'm like an arm
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.400]   chair scientist guy, but bottom line is I know enough about chemistry that if you
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.160]   change the molecular structure of a substance, it is not the original
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.400]   substance, so it's not C-60, and so that's just kind of, you know, here's some,
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.460]   just, these are all the different examples in this study of what a C-60
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.720]   derivative is when you start attaching different molecules and different atoms
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.320]   to, to the C-60 molecule as itself, and so one of the things I kind of want to
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.440]   point out is right here, you know, and this is the simplest example that I can
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.800]   point out for anyone who truly wants to understand what, what's going on here,
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.120]   what do they mean, water soluble? Well, water soluble is a quote different, it's
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.360]   a C-60 molecule with other atoms and molecules attached, it's a derivative of
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.000]   C-60, it is not C-60, so here's an example, and this is the simplest example
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.800]   that I could share with you basic chemistry. If you take the H2O molecule,
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.640]   that's two hydrogen, one oxygen, atom, two, you know, two hydrogen atoms, one
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.720]   oxygen atom, you stick them together, what do you got? Well, you got water, H2O, we
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.440]   all know that, right? Now, if I add another atom, just one more little atom, and I
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.800]   stick it to this molecule, this H2O molecule, and I've added another oxygen
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.920]   molecule, I'll have two hydrogens, two oxygens, H2O2, what do I have if I
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.160]   have H2O2? Well, it turns the water into hydrogen peroxide, what's the difference
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.600]   between water and hydrogen peroxide? I don't need to tell you, so that's where
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   I'm going with this. Now, I'm not saying, and I'm not saying this, okay, I'm not
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.880]   saying that these C-60 derivatives are that, you know, drastic of a contrast,
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.560]   right? But what I am saying is it's not the same molecule, that's my point. Now,
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.400]   the other thing is, is, okay, so they're using this in their product,
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.520]   obviously, they've tested the crap out of it, or they wouldn't be selling it.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.760]   And so, you know, and there's some review of the literature, says that
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.600]   there's some promising attributes, and that you might, you know, it might
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.000]   benefit, you know, from a drug delivery standpoint. And so, I kind of want to
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.920]   point it out that, when you talk about C-60 in the level of, you know, hey, how
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:04.400]   experimental is C-60? Well, I'll tell you what, C-60 has, well, here's the deal,
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.680]   discovered in like, I don't know, like '86, the '92, the three guys that
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.120]   discovered it got the Nobel Prize for discovering it. So, that was in '92, and
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.320]   by 2012, came the famous rat study that said, hey, this thing could make you
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.960]   live longer, or maybe, and it's, it suppresses tumors, and all this great
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.960]   stuff. And then, from 2012, then, you know, it's 2022 now, that's 10 years ago,
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.520]   people have been taking it as a supplement, and studying the heck out of
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.560]   it, in terms of its toxicity, and all of the different marets, different ways
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.520]   that you could take C-60, and what would happen if you did. Now, if you take it as
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.360]   a lipofolourine, i.e., it's dissolved in oil, all of those studies show that it's
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.520]   quite promising and very beneficial. So, that's what we're measuring up against.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:57.160]   Now, is that body of work? Is that body of, you know, of just people taking it
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.920]   for that long, and no ill effects? I mean, if you know, I've made tons of videos
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.360]   about C-60, very interested in it, and I have yet to ever hear one, not even one
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:14.360]   adverse reaction, and I've been running a telegram chat group about C-60 for over
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.120]   three years. I think there's, well, I don't know, like, whatever, hundreds of
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.760]   people in there, and, you know, that sort of thing, and, you know, and then, of
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.200]   course, the videos, and all the comments, and, you know, bottom line, I haven't
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.000]   ever had anyone ever tell me that, and I've never seen anybody ever have a
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.360]   video about it or anything like that. I mean, in terms of adverse reactions.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.160]   So, there's some, you know, I'm not saying it's perfect, but there is a body of
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:41.480]   evidence, and the studies to back them up, that C-60 is not cytotoxic, and it's
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.840]   actually beneficial. All right, but then, when you talk about these other things,
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:50.520]   these, quote, C-60 derivatives, you know, do they have the same body of evidence?
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.640]   So, one of the things I do want to point out, you know, and these studies are in
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.960]   the video description, is this is what a, this is what a C-60 derivative is, and
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.120]   all the different variations of C-60 derivatives, but then, if you look at
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.960]   this study, and this is a really important study, okay, it's a review,
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.360]   actually, it's a review of studies, right? It's hilarious, you know, scientists,
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.480]   right? They'll, scientists will do studies, and then other scientists will do
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.000]   reviews of their studies, you know? But this is a really good summation of the
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.200]   different studies that have been done just on a particular type of C-60
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.440]   derivative, called a foranol. Now, what's a foranol? Well, a foranol is when you
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:33.400]   take a C-60 molecule, and you add oxygen and hydrogen atoms to it, so this is what
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:38.840]   it looks like, okay? So, it's a very specific C-60 derivative, where the
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.400]   only thing you're attaching to it are OH, which is oxygen and hydrogen. So, you're
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.280]   just adding two atoms, and you're connecting it to the C-60 molecule, and
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:53.800]   you're doing them in pairs, so you can have a, you know, basically C-60 with two
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.840]   of these OH molecules attached. All the way up to, I think, it's like 60
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.080]   something, where there's different points on the C-60 molecule, you can attach
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.360]   these other two atoms. So, you can see right here, I'm just going to blow this
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.040]   up, you can see where the HO's and the OH's attach, and all the different
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.000]   variations of this particular combination, which is called foranol. I'm really
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.080]   sorry about the chemistry lesson right now, I don't mean to do that, what I
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.000]   want to mean, what I'm sorry, what I mean to do is show you this, and this is what
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.760]   I wanted to point out, because I think this is very important. When you talk
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.000]   about C-60 derivatives, and then you talk specifically about
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.600]   fulernals, okay, one of the many, then here's a review
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.000]   of the different studies conducted on fulernals,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.120]   and the results, and so the thing about it is that, you know, depending on how you
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.360]   do it, and how many different modifications of a
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.800]   fulernal you could have, you get different results.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:59.480]   So, some of them, like here's one where they tried a C-60 OH-32, so there's 32
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.880]   of these OH molecules attached to the C-60 molecules, and they tested it on
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:11.000]   human epidermal keratin sites, skin, and it created, it was
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.560]   basically caused skin death, all right, then they tried it on
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.280]   liver microzomes, and it had UV significant lipids, protein oxidation
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:25.480]   damage, so you know, it's like good bad, not good, and then
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:31.000]   you had other ones right here, you had autophagy, cell growth, that's good,
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.520]   then other variations of the C-60 OH, you had some
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.840]   some super, you know, basically light-produced
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:44.600]   superoxide retinal phototoxic damage, not good, then there's this other one
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:51.000]   where, oh hey, C-60 OH-24 on Chinese hamster ovary cells
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.840]   produced a strong antioxidant influencing cellular redox state,
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.000]   that's good, so good, bad, bad, good, really really bad, really really good,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.120]   so you can see where, as they studied all of these different
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.280]   combinations of C-60 derivatives specific to foreign oils,
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.800]   you get a whole bunch of different responses and a whole bunch of different
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.400]   results, and that's the point I'm trying to make, okay,
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.760]   is that when you start talking about water soluble C-60,
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:24.520]   you're talking about a C-60 derivative, and the thing about these
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.760]   products, I scoured their website, they don't disclose exactly which
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.600]   derivative they're using, is it C-60 OH-24,
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.560]   or is it what, what is it, and but you know, they're saying, hey, we've
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.440]   tested it, you know, so hey, I'm not saying that
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.000]   they're, you know, whatever they're claiming is not real,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.400]   I'm just saying that, you know what, it'd be really nice to know, as a consumer,
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:51.560]   what exactly are you putting in there, and where are the studies that back it up,
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.040]   because the one thing I also want to point out
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:59.080]   about C-60 derivatives as compared to C-60
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.840]   fullerenes, okay, so when you say it's like, this is Google Scholar, and this is
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.880]   where you go and pull up, you know, the Google,
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.800]   you know, world of science studies, science articles, and so forth, this is
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.440]   just for scientists, right, and I love using this, because if you want to know
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.280]   anything, you just look up, and so, it's a C-60
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.840]   fullerene, so if you type in C-60 fullerene in the
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:25.560]   word and, you can get and tumor, right, boom,
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.840]   you can get, you can get, well, you get, you know, you get
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.360]   all these studies where people have studied C-60 in tumors, they've discovered
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.120]   that it's animatostatic, and then it can suppress tumor growth, how about
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.640]   macular, you know, macular degeneration, you can see C-60 in
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.400]   the studies that they've done on macular degeneration, you could look at C-60
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.640]   and diabetes, right, you can see, hey, you know, there's all these studies
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.480]   where people have done studies with C-60 and all of these different conditions,
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.400]   obviously, they're using rats, and a lot of these, if you just, there's,
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:01.800]   there's tons and tons and tons of these studies on C-60 itself, the pristine
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.240]   C-60, but you can see where there's a lot of
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.400]   studies done on C-60, it's now in comparison,
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:15.240]   C-60 derivatives and, and there, you know, nothing pops, let me just try
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.640]   C-60 derivatives and tumor, I'm just doing this live, you can do it at home, too,
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:24.040]   play along with me, and there are some C-60 derivatives,
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.880]   right, where they're testing, this is a full and all right here, C-60, O-H, right,
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.880]   and there is a, a few, but if you, if you, but my point is, if you look
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.560]   down the list, you'll see that a lot of these
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.040]   C-60 derivative studies are still in the infancy stage,
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:44.760]   in terms of there's not that huge body of studies that have been testing it for
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:49.080]   10 years, but more so, they're still studying it as a drug delivery system
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.960]   and the sciences are still tinkering around with them.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.160]   It hasn't even reached the point where C-60 itself is
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.440]   because it came after C-60, you know, that makes sense, right?
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.880]   So that's the point I want to make that, you know what, it's not C-60,
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:07.400]   it's definitely not C-60, it is a derivative and, and you know what, if
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.000]   you're going to be buying a product and they've got a lot of wonderful claims,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.440]   I'm not saying that they're wrong, but what I'm saying is that there is not the
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.680]   body of evidence that supports C-60 and the one thing that I personally, in my
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.320]   humble opinion, think that it's not, in my mind,
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:31.080]   proper that any one of these guys quote C-60 studies on their website and make
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.000]   claims that, you know, that C-60 has attributes, right?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.080]   And if you're making claims that these C-60 attributes apply to your
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:45.560]   derivative, okay, prove it. But, you know, do not list C-60 studies on your website
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.560]   if you're not selling C-60, you're selling a C-60 derivative,
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.000]   and I've looked at some of these websites and, you know, I'm not pointing
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.480]   out anybody, I'm not, this is not a, you know, like, you know, I'm not trying to
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.480]   bash anybody, but I'm just saying, as I did the research in this, so many of these
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:07.720]   different companies are quoting C-60 studies when they're not selling C-60.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:13.000]   All right, next one. Carbon nano onions, so what is exactly is a carbon nano
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.680]   onion? Okay, it's not, it's not a C-60 molecule,
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.960]   but you'll notice the title of these products says what?
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:26.280]   Supercharged C-60, super carbon 60, all right, but is this C-60? It's not even a
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.520]   full ring. Okay, so let me show you what the
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.920]   difference is. Now, in the world of C-60, or the world of carbon,
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.000]   what they call them, allotropes, right, different forms of carbon molecules are
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.680]   called allotropes, and there's different forms, like one of the most famous forms
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.000]   of carbon is the diamond. Another one is graphite inside your pencils,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.640]   and then of course, you know, lately everyone's always worried about
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.960]   graphene, but here's the idea, here's the full ring C-60 and the full ring,
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:57.560]   here's just a picture of a full ring C-540. I mean, there's like 39 different types
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.560]   of fullerenes, and that's just the number of carbon atoms
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:07.320]   put into a cage shape. Okay, and so here's the the fullerene C-60 molecule,
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:11.160]   and it's one of the allotropes of C-60, it's crystallized allotropes, as opposed
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.000]   to, never mind, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Anyway, so then you get into this, this
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:23.720]   other version of a carbon allotrop, it is not C-60. It is a full ring, all right,
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.160]   and they call these things nested fullerenes, and what they are, and it's
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:32.360]   quite remarkable, is that they're a cage, it's like a fullerene cage
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:38.040]   with just a gob of C-60 atoms inside another cage, inside another cage,
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:43.880]   inside another cage. It's like a little onion made up of carbon atoms
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.200]   stuck together, like a little ball, and it's one ball and another ball and so
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:53.880]   it's really quite a unique molecule, but it's obviously definitely not C-60.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.080]   So, why would I, you know, so here's my thing, you know, hey, let's be
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:02.760]   honest with everybody, hey man, it's not C-60, why are you using the term C-60?
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.320]   It's clearly not even related, other than it's just, you know, it is a
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.400]   fullerene molecule, right, it's a fullerene atro,
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:17.400]   allotrop, I'm sorry, but it's not, it's not C-60, it's called a carbon nano
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.120]   onion, and so here's a couple of products that are being sold on the
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.720]   market right now. Being sold, you know, with the, you know,
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.360]   they're just kind of attaching the concept of C-60,
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.760]   because C-60 is the grandfather of all of these outro, you know, in terms of just
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.520]   having all that evidence that it's good, so they, you know, obviously are trying to
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.840]   leverage that term C-60 onto their product, but they're not, it's not even
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.560]   C-60, it's, as my title of my video, it's not C-60.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.200]   And so both of these products are using a carbon nano onion that's produced by a
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.280]   company called Graphics, and I got to tell you, you know, and again, I'm not bashing
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.400]   anybody, I'm just saying, hey man, you're going to use the word, you know, C-60,
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.240]   you know, it should be C-60 or make, instead it should be saying supercharged
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.200]   carbon nano onions, right, I mean, that's what it is, it's not C-60.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.720]   But anyway, so if you go to the Graphics website, you know, I got to tell you,
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:10.760]   they did a lot of their own studies and the results are remarkable.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.040]   And in fact, when you go on to Google Scholar and you go check out like, hey,
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.880]   you know, let's take a look at the studies about carbon nano onions and
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.200]   that's potential. There's not a lot of studies out there about carbon nano
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:27.160]   onions, but there's a lot of, you know, just, you know, basically a lot of,
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.720]   there's a lot of science about using carbon nano onions as drug delivery
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.680]   systems, just like we would do with C-60 and all the other fullerenes, the
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.880]   cage fullerenes. So there is a lot of interest in it, there's a lot,
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.480]   there's quite a bit of studies that are supporting carbon nano onions.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.080]   So when we start looking at carbon nano onions, and you say, and
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.920]   diabetes and tumors and all that sort of thing, you will find that there's been
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.840]   some carbon nano nano onion studies done on cancer and so forth.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.000]   So there's a little bit farther ahead than C-60 derivatives because there's like,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.960]   well, there's an unlimited number of derivatives, obviously. So it's really
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.240]   hard to get a body of evidence of that stuff.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.480]   But there's a lot, you know, carbon nano onions are singular, like a C-60
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.720]   molecule. So there's a lot more study about carbon nano onions. And I'll tell
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.480]   you of any of any of these kind of like not C-60 products,
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.920]   carbon nano onions in my personal opinion look pretty interesting.
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.800]   So when you go on Google Scholar and you look at the literature,
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.800]   you know, it does look very promising. But I got to tell you,
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:31.080]   you know, here's the deal. The same thing about water soluble C-60
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.280]   and carbon nano onions, all right, is that none of them have anything even
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:43.400]   remotely close to the, you know, the body rat study that kicked off the C-60
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.920]   supplement thing, that there is none of these have that
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:51.800]   anti-aging tumor suppressive in mammal study yet.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:57.000]   Okay, now, graphics did do their own studies, but you know, we're talking,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.480]   you know, you can't, you can't base a lot
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.920]   on studies done by the guy who's selling you the stuff, right?
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.960]   I mean, I don't, I'm not saying it's false. I'm not saying that at all.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.480]   I'm saying, you know, I totally have nothing against graphics.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.520]   But, you know, come on, where's your third party independent,
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:20.040]   you know, lab studies of your, of your, you know, nano onion product,
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.560]   the graphics super 60, right? So that's what I'm trying to say. But, you know,
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.480]   if you look at the graphics, I mean, they're, they're,
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.680]   their research on their website is amazing of what they have been able to do
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.280]   with their own product. And then, of course, now they've got
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.040]   retail distributors out there. And the two retail products of the graphics
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.240]   super 60 is one, you know, these two right here.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:47.080]   So, point made, it's not C-60. It's, I think it's more promising than
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:52.280]   water soluble C-60. The research is, is, is more,
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.400]   you know, developed than C-60 derivatives.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.560]   And there you go. Again, but, you know, it's not C-60.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.080]   And I think the only thing that's kind of, again, my personal opinion
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:07.880]   is you don't use C-60. It's not C-60 is your, in your product name.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:13.080]   And again, too, don't be quoting any C-60 studies when you're not selling C-60,
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.640]   you know, on your websites. And that's all of these guys
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.840]   have all of this stuff on their websites about C-60, but they're not
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.800]   selling it. I'm, you know, you know, that's not cool.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.440]   So, the last thing I want to point out, the third category of not C-60,
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.200]   and this one's the one that just, just drives me crazy.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:35.320]   Are they sungai C-60s? Okay. Nothing against the shungai crowd.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.360]   And, and there's this huge, I mean, I'll tell you that I took the most
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:44.280]   hate I've ever taken in my entire YouTube career when I put out this
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.120]   video called, you know, Full Arena C-60 and Shungai.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.120]   And I, I just, you know, in this video is going to, it, you know, I don't,
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.240]   I'm not going to go into it. There's a whole video all about, hey,
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.320]   guess what? There's no, there's no C-60 and Shungai.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.000]   Not, not if you're going to, you know, mathematically and
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   scientifically evaluate the amount of C-60 and Shungai.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.920]   You know, is it present? Yeah. Is it present in any amount that would make
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.720]   any difference or in any significance whatsoever?
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:19.000]   No, not at all. And I reviewed a ton of literature
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.840]   about it, Russian, you know, studies from the Russians themselves, geological
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.120]   surveys, you name it. This video is probably one of my best videos
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.520]   personally because I spent so much time researching
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:35.080]   specifically, hey, you know, is there really any C-60 and Shungai worth mentioning?
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.560]   Like even, even remotely associate the word C-60 with the phrase
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:44.440]   Shungai? No, the answer's no, no, no, no. But, you know, hey,
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.960]   Shungai people, please don't hate on me, okay? Because it's just what the science
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   shows, right? The science shows that, you know, it's not, it's
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.920]   it's inconsequential. So anybody who sits there and tries to associate the
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:01.960]   word Shungai with C-60, man, not, not, not cool at all.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:06.360]   It's not even, it's not C-60. It is not C-60.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.960]   So here's a couple of products out there and I just want to point out, just one
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.880]   that's called, you know, the website's called Shungai C-60. It's like
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.480]   Apple Dash Orange, you know, yeah, you know, it's an orange. No, it's not, it's an apple.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.680]   Come on, come on, come on. You know, let's just, you know, anyway.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:24.120]   And so you get what I'm coming from it. This one really frustrates me, man,
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.240]   because I did a ton of research and I proved it
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.520]   that there is none. And then there's this one that just, it just kills me.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.080]   I've actually ran into people who bought Shungai powder because the seller
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:40.600]   told him it was C-60 and they tried to make C-60 oil with ground up rock
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.880]   and then they got ahold of me and said, it's not, it's not, you know, it's,
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.560]   it's just settling to the bottom. It's not, it's not dissolving in oil.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.240]   And I'm like, what'd you buy? And they sent me the link and I'm like, you bought
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:56.120]   ground up rock. That's not even C-60. It's, and it is kind of, and they, and the
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.440]   course they got taken for, you know, they got taken.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.560]   So I'm going to kind of show you something that, you know, it's just, this is just
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:07.400]   how bad it is. You know, this is one of the many, many, many, many people on eBay
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:13.320]   selling elite Shungai pure carbon 98%, natural C-60, my favorite.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:19.400]   It's not fake. Okay, okay, but look what he says.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.720]   This, I'm sorry, it just cracks me up. And so this is what this person says. He goes,
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.120]   hey, um, yeah, okay, I got to stretch this over.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:32.360]   Let me just kind of scoot my little thing in every here so you can see this page.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.120]   There we go. I'm going to scoot the page over. Okay, so this is what he says.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:43.400]   Okay, elite Shungai is almost pure carbon 98, 99%, Shungai full arena C-60.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:49.320]   Uh, no, it's not. It is absolutely not. If you
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:55.160]   take a look at this video, I show you all the scientific papers. What is Shungai?
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:03.560]   Shungai is, is essentially 50% amorphous carbon and 50%, um, what, silica, right?
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.920]   You know, like 49 and 49, the other 2% are some just basic other heavy metals and things like that.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:15.480]   But it's not, but in the amorphous carbon that comprises Shungai, there's, I think there's, uh,
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:21.400]   as from what I mean, I did this like in 2019, but oh, I think there's five or seven or something
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:27.320]   like that different. Uh, I think it's five different types of Shungai. So you've got a
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.800]   crystalline version and an amorphous version, right? So if you're buying something like this,
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:37.080]   that's the amorphous version where the carbon and the silica, the carbon with the silica
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.600]   is amorphous carbon. And then you've got this version, which is like type one,
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.960]   which is you've got crystalline carbon. So, you know, there's two different types of carbon
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.760]   and with the silica. So it comes out looking like a, like a shiny rock as opposed to a dull black,
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:56.440]   you know, but here's this guy selling dull black amorphous carbon, Shungai as C-60. And here's a
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:03.480]   guy promoting, you know, crystalline, you know, carbon as Shungai, you see them going, it gets
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:09.880]   complicated. But at the end of the day, it's not C-60. Absolutely not. So that's what I got to share.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.880]   And that's what I wanted to share today. I hope this was educational and hope it helps you. Please,
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:19.960]   please caveat, emptor. Okay. If you remember your Latin 101 from high school, buy or beware.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:26.760]   All right. I'm just sharing, I'm hoping you guys kind of understand what is C-60, what's not,
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:32.200]   that there are quite a few, there are not a lot, but there's products now being developed and being
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:39.480]   sold with the title C-60 that as I just demonstrated, absolutely is not C-60. If you're interested in
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.600]   C-60, then buy C-60 and make sure you read the website really clearly and make sure that they're
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:52.600]   selling you actually C-60 dissolved in olive oil or when a pick on oil. Okay. And it's just C-60.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:57.720]   It's not a derivative. It's not that sort of thing. And of course, you know, and again, you know,
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:02.840]   as you'll see that these C-60 guys, this is the study that kicked it all off, the prolongation
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:08.360]   of lifespan of rats by repeated oral administration of C-60 fluorine. That's what kicked it off.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.760]   You know, and so if they're referencing this, then you then, you know, then are they really,
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.160]   you know, are they selling C-60 or not? But this is the study that kicked it all off,
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:21.960]   buy or beware, and thank you very much for watching this video. I really appreciate your time and
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:27.320]   attention. I hope this was, you know, I hope you learned something. And you know, I'll keep an eye
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:32.200]   out for these kinds of things and share with them with you as they come up just to just educate
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.520]   everybody and just share what I'm learning as I'm learning it. So thank you very much. If you
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:41.000]   have any questions about C-60, you know, come on down to our chat group on Telegram. We have a
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.680]   C-60 chat group. Also on my blog, there'll be a link below. I've got a whole section of my blog
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:53.080]   completely dedicated to C-60. I've been making C-60 videos since, well, 2018 or something. So,
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:29:00.040]   you know, it's a lot of content on C-60. And again, hey, thanks a lot. Have a great day, guys. Aloha.
