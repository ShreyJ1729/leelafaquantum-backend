[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another tinker's academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and this
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.000]   video is a further installment in the video series benefits of quantum healing where I've been
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.720]   documenting the independent third-party studies that have been commissioned by Leila Quantum Tech
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.920]   on the use of their quantum devices and quantum service as well as documenting some of the user
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.200]   testimonies that have come up in our telegram chat group. This particular video covers a new
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.080]   study that just came out here in June of 2024 on the quantum effect of food intolerances.
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.760]   So the study is now available on the website at leila.com and is titled the influence of the
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.360]   infinity block technology on food intolerances. The objective of the study now was to investigate
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.440]   the influence of the Leila quantum infinity block on patients with food intolerances and they asked
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.680]   two primary questions of the clinicians in trying to you know run the study and these were the
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.720]   questions I were asked was number one does the quantum field in the infinity block influence food
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.560]   intolerances by improving tolerance levels and number two to what extent does the quantum field
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.400]   affect individuals with food intolerances. Now the study was conducted by the principal
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.320]   investigators was conducted at a facility called the naturopathic clinic of Ruth Knott costs hopefully
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.560]   I'm pronounced that correctly that's located in Munich Germany. The investigator was a individual
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.440]   by the name of Merga Erlich Stock who holds a diploma in biology works in the department of
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.240]   microbiology at the clinic and she's been a naturopath since in practice since 1986. The area of focus
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.160]   for this clinic is in bio resonance therapy energy medicine detoxification of modern pollutants
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.520]   and consultation. So now this one is a little different in terms of the way that the study was
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.640]   conducted. It was conducted using a device called the meta human device. Now this is a
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.520]   bio resonance device used in naturopathic clinic throughout the world and it's based on the
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.600]   on the on the principles of quantum physics as well as quantum biology. So kind of give you a real
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.680]   kind of really simple idea of how bio resonance works and it is a very, very, very established
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.640]   science. You'll find NIH studies about using these things and it's used for therapy as well as
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.160]   diagnostics. But if you want to just consult a Bing, Bing kind of has a really good explanation
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.360]   of what it is. So let's go ahead and ask Bing, which you know is connected to chat GPD for,
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:32.400]   on what is. So let me just go ahead and ask and let chat GPT explain it to you. What is bio resonance?
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:40.000]   Bio resonance is a type of therapy used in holistic or complementary medicine that uses
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.360]   a machine to measure the frequency of energy wavelengths coming from the body. It is based
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.480]   on modern biophysics, which teaches us that every cell in our body resonates at a particular
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.880]   frequency, which takes the form of electromagnetic field. Bio resonance therapy is a holistic,
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.680]   non-invasive way of diagnosing and treating various diseases, which involves the use of
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.800]   electrodes on the skin. The electrodes are connected to an energy wavelength machine
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.480]   called a BICOM device to detect unhealthy frequencies on the cells, such as viruses and cancer cells.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.240]   So what this machine essentially does, or what the software and all of these devices do,
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.800]   is it has in there, through the years of the development of the science of bio resonance,
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.840]   it has a database of exactly what, quote, a healthy and optimal, you know, performing
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.080]   or organ in any area of the body. It can basically, it already has it in the database, meaning that
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.480]   it's been studied and it's been documented, it's sitting in the software, it knows exactly what
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.680]   every single part of your body should look like from an electromagnetic resonance standpoint.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.360]   And then it measures you against that, you know, that baseline and it kind of determines whether
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.320]   or not what parts of your anatomy are having stress and or issues. And so that's what they do.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:13.200]   Now the test procedure for this study was they tested three different types of foods, which was
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.000]   a gluten containing bread, cow's milk, cheese and cane sugar. The test procedure itself was to use
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.440]   the infinity block and the bio resonance device. And they basically would take the foods and they
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.520]   would place it on the on this little pad right here, which would then read the bio resonance signature
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:42.720]   of the food. And then they would then then expose the person to that bio resonance using the device.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.960]   And then they would test the energy signature of the food against the energy signature of the
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.040]   individual first. And then the second that was the before picture. And then the after picture
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.480]   was they would take the food, place it in the infinity block for three minutes. And then they
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.600]   would run the test again. So the whole idea here is that they're not having people who have like
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.160]   IBS or, you know, gluten intolerance, and they're not here, eat this, see what happens to you. You
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.200]   know, that, you know, that they did it completely on a bio resonance standpoint, which was expose it
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.280]   to you, you know, energetically, and then put it in the infinity block and then re expose it
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.400]   to the individuals to see how their body, their resonances were picking up the the food,
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.520]   the energy signature of the food. So it's all done purely at a real quantum level. And again,
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.960]   it's an actual science and it's pretty cool how it works. So that's the before and the after picture,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.760]   right? They just basically would put, you know, you know, subject the person to the food. And then
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.200]   they would subject the person to the food after it was charged, using the bio resonance device
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.080]   called the meta vital. Now there's four participants in the study age range from 41 to 61. And they
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.120]   basically is number one through four. And each one of them had a different issue that they, you know,
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.920]   that they had to go and find people that had issues. So the first one is an individual who had a
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.920]   gluten intolerance. And so they, they measured his response against against the bread that contained
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:16.400]   gluten by evaluating the pancreas. Another individual that number two had has a leaky gut syndrome.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.000]   And then they did the same with cheese. And then they took a look at the small intestine. And then
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.040]   with the third individual who was a pre who's pre diabetic, they wanted to see exactly what the
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.400]   effect of cane sugar was on their pancreas. And they did the same thing for the fourth participant.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.840]   So to kind of just pop you into the study itself, you can obviously go and read this on the website.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:44.000]   But here's the basic study itself. It's quite, it's pretty short for pages. And so now again,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.200]   the software program has all of this built into the database. It's being able to measure everything.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.320]   And so it goes with a color coding as well. You know, for simplicity of use, just like the
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:01.440]   bio resonance or sorry, the bio energetic devices at BESA. And so now this clinic used this device
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.280]   and it basically color coded so that the different symbols that you see are on the various pictures
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.680]   that you'll be showing. And the pictures I'll be showing, which are from the software of the
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.600]   Metavidal Human Design or, you know, human device, right shows the different colors that say, hey,
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.400]   basically, you know, you know, it's in good condition, you know, that that area of the body,
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.840]   the, you know, the pancreas or the small intestines, you know, are healthy. And then of course, then
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.440]   there's then then it can actually pick up the resonance of when the organ is not healthy and
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.320]   it's being subjected to stress. And so they've got, there's a symbol here for imbalance.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.120]   There's a, you know, basically a triangle and then a diamond shape, you'll see, and I'll show
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.480]   any sec where it's showing that, you know, it's severely, severely impaired condition. And then,
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:54.640]   of course, these little black squares, which means it's a compensatory, compensatory. Sorry,
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.400]   capacity is no longer present, which means, hey, you know, the organs being negatively affected.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.360]   So the first subject here was was the gluten intolerance. And they took a look at the pancreas,
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.240]   and this is what a picture looks like. And so this is what a picture of their pancreas being
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:16.480]   exposed to gluten. And you can see where the initial picture, which was right off the bat,
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.040]   which was showing these down arrows, these little, I'm sorry, these down triangles. Now,
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.880]   these down triangles, again, basically imply that there's been an imbalance that is definitely
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.200]   negatively affected affecting them. You don't see any of these yellows, you know, there's only
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.520]   one yellow. That's the kind of the idea on how you read these. So basically, it's like, hey,
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.680]   you know what, there's a, there's an imbalance here. This individual is definitely struggling
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.280]   with gluten when they take a look at their pancreas, when they're exposed to gluten.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.240]   And then when they put the bread in the infinity block for three minutes and they retested the
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.520]   individual, you could see where all of the down triangles, the imbalances are all completely gone
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:59.120]   now. And then they've actually gone to a very good condition. It's actually improved their
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.800]   bio resonance in their energy signature of the pancreas by having the, by having exposed to the
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.840]   food that's been charged in the quantum block or the infinity block. And so right here, basically,
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.720]   the image description, they basically, the software doesn't evaluation and it shows, hey,
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:22.400]   that there's been a 71% enhancement of the body's compensatory reaction to the food that's charged
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.000]   as opposed to the food that's not charged. So in other words, that there was a 71%
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.760]   enhancement of the body's ability to handle gluten on an energetic basis.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.160]   So number two, is this individual here who had a leaky gut syndrome? And then what they did was
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.640]   they exposed this individual to cow's milk, cheese, and they evaluated this small intestine. Again,
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.760]   you'll see a lot of the down triangles saying that there's an imbalance. And you know, and then
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.080]   there's some, you know, yellows. And then they go over here and you see all of the down triangles
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:59.680]   turned to up triangles. Okay, which means in the up triangles simply mean that has become good
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:05.520]   conditions. So it's gone from an imbalance. If you take a look at this, that the pancreas is,
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.480]   I'm sorry, the small intestine is completely having an imbalance effect by being, by being
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.760]   exposed to cheese with this individual who has leaky gut. And then once the cheese has been charged,
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:22.080]   that completely flips over from being imbalanced to tolerant. And so this software on the software
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:28.800]   program on this individual showed that the individual had a 44% enhancement of the body's ability
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.880]   to tolerate, you know, the cow's milk cheese on their leaky gut on their small intestine.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.080]   The third one here is this individual is a prediabetic. They took a look at the pancreas.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:47.040]   Again, you'll see a lot of the black, or you see these blacks, black squares, black diamonds.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.080]   This means that there's quite a bit of a stress on the small, I'm sorry, the pancreas right here.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.320]   You'll see these black and severely impaired condition. And that's what that means. And so
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:03.280]   they're seeing, you know, showing severe conditions, you're showing damage. And so then that's the
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:09.280]   individual with prediabetic and you, you know, give them sugar, basically sugar, or they were
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.280]   using cane sugar on the pancreas. Okay, so they took a look at the pancreas,
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.880]   definitely said, Hey, there's some, you know, there's definitely an impact, a negative impact on the
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.360]   pancreas from this individual being exposed to cane sugar. And then of course, after they
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.480]   charged it, all of the symbols change over to optimal condition. And the software reported that
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:35.600]   there was a 75% enhancement of the individual's ability to to tolerate cane sugar after the sugar
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.640]   was charged. So that's an incredible increase in just the ability for the person to tolerate. So
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.200]   these, you know, this is all about in, you know, food and tolerance, right? So again, the last,
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.720]   the fourth one here was a prediabetic. Again, they tested the, this one was they tested the
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:57.200]   pancreas on the exposure to shame cane sugar. And this individual here, again, from the up arrows,
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:04.000]   now all of the, all the, I'm sorry, the triangles and the overall condition of this pancreas wasn't
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   too bad on this person. But then you could see the amount of yellow that appears on the after image,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.120]   which was the charged, you know, sugar. And so this report here, the software basically said,
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:21.120]   you know, when we measured this individual before and after, we showed a 51% enhancement of the
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:27.360]   body's ability to tolerate sugar. And so that's really how the software works and how the device
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:33.600]   works. And it basically for every single individual, it demonstrated that there was an enhancement
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.480]   enhancement of the individual's ability to, you know, tolerate the food, whether it was, you know,
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:44.640]   someone with leaky gut or a prediabetic and so forth. But overall, there was a 71 or 44% all the
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:51.120]   way up to a 71% enhancement of the person's ability to tolerate those foods after they have
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.640]   been charged. And so this overall summary of the study was the study shows that the quantum field
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:02.960]   within the Leila quantum infinity block improved the tolerability of tested foods for each participant
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.720]   and exposure period of three minutes to the infinity block was sufficient
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.800]   to alleviate the negative effects of these foods. This led to a restoration of physiological conditions,
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:18.160]   regulatory functions and energy levels to stages ranging from satisfactory to optimal.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.200]   Now, this is the key thing here. It's important to note that this study serves as a pilot investigation
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.000]   and as such, you know, definitive conclusions cannot yet be drawn. However, it illustrates a
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.720]   promising trend towards a significant enhancement in the quality of life concerning food intolerance
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.680]   is further studies are planned to corroborate these findings and results will be disseminated
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:43.680]   accordingly. So in parting, I'd like to just say that these findings are completely aligned with
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.920]   the testimonies that you'll be reading in the telegram chat group of, you know, with there's
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:53.680]   over 7,000 members now and they're in over the last three years and people have reported multiple
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:14:00.160]   different instances where people have intolerances to citrus or, you know, or just anything. I mean,
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.680]   it's just like I have an intolerance to MSG. I've done the same experiment myself, which I documented
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:12.480]   in the benefits of quantum healing on allergens, the very initial test that was done. And in every
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.160]   single instance where people are saying, Hey, you know, I used to have a problem with eating,
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.880]   you know, kiwifruit or whatever, but I put it in the block and, you know, and then after after I
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.000]   put it in the block and I ate it, I didn't I didn't have that reaction. And that that story,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.800]   those testimonies have been coming in for three years now. And so this, this bile resonance study
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.920]   that just came out really kind of exemplifies in a clinical setting, the same thing that we're
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:44.320]   seeing in testimonial and a total report. So it's quite remarkable that we've now actually have
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:50.560]   documentation or a study that actually has taken it to a scientific level. And basically demonstrating
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:56.160]   that, yes, by putting foods in a block, if you are have if you have an intolerance to it,
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:04.800]   it will definitely help you be less intolerant to it anywhere from, you know, 44 to 75% less. So,
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:11.760]   but here I want to just also claim one more thing to, you know, that Leila quantum tech still
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.800]   does not recommend doing this for all of the various reasons that, you know, they don't want
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.440]   to take responsibility and they shouldn't for decisions you make. So, you know, again,
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:28.400]   I want to clarify that it is not recommended you do this at home. You know, just because of the
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.440]   studies and the testimonies, however, you know, we're all adults and you're free to tinker,
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:41.120]   just as much as I tinker. And my only caveat would be is, you know, this demonstrates what we know
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.680]   has been happening for all these years now. And it's, and it's just remarkable in its findings
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:51.920]   that there's this ability for quantum energy to somehow, you know, lower the intolerance level of
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.800]   foods that people have problems with. So, you know, you're adult, and if you want to give it a try,
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.800]   that's up to you, you know, it's not recommended. And I and personally, if you have a severe histamine
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.400]   reaction where you required EpiPen, then I totally do not recommend that you do that. If
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.400]   you're intolerance is that severe, you know, I mean, there are people that are, if you have to
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.720]   have an EpiPen because you're allergic to something, then, then yeah, it's highly don't, you know,
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.720]   we just absolutely don't, you know, don't take the risk. However, if it's just something like,
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:26.560]   you know, seafood, you know, gives you, you know, and digestive problems, right? And, you know,
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.880]   it's tolerable, you know, then, you know, you might want to give it a try and see if it helps you
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.840]   because it has helped many, many other people. So there you go. That's the new report on food
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.800]   intolerances. That's just came out. Thank you for watching the video. If you want to learn more,
