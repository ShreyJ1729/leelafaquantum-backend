[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Okay
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   Hello everyone and welcome to another takers Academy video
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:16.080]   I'm your host calmer and today I've got a very very special treat the topic of this video is going to be called raising the Christ oil
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.000]   And I've got on the line with me Anna the science witch
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.560]   So for those of you who don't hang out in our telegram chat group for our health and healing chat group
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:32.160]   Anaya was also an a steal and she lives in Bali Indonesia. She's a practicing holistic healer
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.620]   She's got a degree in Chinese traditional medicine and a plumbing
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:44.480]   Chikong been practicing Tai Chi for years a Hermetic medicine self-taught and also a practitioner in electoral healing
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.320]   She's been pract I think the county right you've had you've been a clinician for seven years and I've been studying for 13 is that is that right?
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.480]   Those are pretty much I started studying Ayurveda in
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.120]   2009 and then
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.920]   Graduated in 2013
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.160]   So yeah, all of that combined
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.360]   Yeah, that's great. So, you know welcome and and good morning to you
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.200]   So everybody, you know, this is gonna be a real treat
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.000]   She's one of my favorite people one of my favorite healers because and how we met was a couple of years ago
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.240]   We were just chatting in the chat group
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.120]   And she mentioned that she, you know, used a Likovsky multi wave oscillator and a violet ray
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.640]   In her practice and and I was just all years because I'm my background as bio electrical magnetics
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.560]   And so it's kind of just amazing that someone who's a list holistic practitioner would be using bio electrical tools
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.700]   And so that's how we met and actually we did a
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.360]   Interview back then I was like two years ago
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.320]   And so if you want to hear that one, I'll put a link in the video description below which was basically a video about
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.300]   Anna's background and how she uses bio electrical devices in her practice
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.760]   But then since those last two years though, you've really just kind of like expanded, right?
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.460]   I mean, I just think that you know, you've just I think you've put out like 20 videos and you're really a lot of focus on
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.040]   I think just the topic. We're gonna be talking about it. Just I have a hard time explaining it everybody
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.520]   Because I feel like a toddler, you know, when I when I compare myself to your level of knowledge
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.840]   In terms of how much I know about health and healing but so for those of you, you're not interested in what we're gonna talk about
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.560]   The topic of this video is going to be an electromagnetic self-healing practices umbrella, okay?
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.080]   Yeah, EM healing without gadgets a practice one can do every month when the moon aligns with your star sign this causes an EM
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.160]   translification in the brainstem and phospinal fluid known as the crucifixion the work or honest books that she's been doing over the last
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:59.080]   Year has is contains the process known as raising the Christ oil which is found in the biblical decodes which with
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.600]   daoist ketra kick, you know, I just
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.680]   Chikung practice of the micro cosmic orbit to guide energy through the spine in the cosmic monthly event
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.800]   It really does work and honest here today to share it with you
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.520]   To help you learn how to do it safe and effectively so hana good morning and thank you for joining me
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.480]   I'm gonna jump over to your slides now
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.560]   And I guess the first question that I had and I'm a little head of the game because I did watch a couple of her videos folks
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.440]   And links to those in the video description below as well for those of you would like to learn a little bit more about it
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.200]   But the concept of raising the Christ oil
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.520]   Could you explain that in layman terms like like a lot of us are self healers, right?
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.520]   We want we want to improve our house improve our wellness, prove our you know a consciousness and
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.000]   But what is exactly like when you say the Christ oh what it what is the Christ oil?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.800]   Well firstly what we have to understand about all of these
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.920]   Words is that they're actually all coded words. So
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.360]   Jesus Christ
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.280]   When we decode what the etymology or the word root meaning means of Jesus Christ
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:20.360]   we actually get two words and Jesus means the seed or the essence or the spirit and
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.720]   The Christ or the creost means a cross
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.840]   With the sun going around the cross does the agricultural cycle of the four seasons and also means anointing oil
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:41.640]   so when we put those two together and we apply it to the anatomy of physiology of the body it's talking about a
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.840]   seed that we can
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.760]   use our seed our essence our spirit essence that we can
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.000]   Anoint ourselves with
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.240]   Every month when the sun goes around
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.120]   The earth and the moon goes around the earth. So it's kind of like it's a bit. It's a deep code
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.280]   to
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.280]   Start breaking down
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.800]   Okay
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.560]   When when all of that is put into the context of the human body. It's basically
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.960]   An event that happens within your body
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.520]   Excuse me once a month when the moon
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.760]   Comes into your star sign and the lines with with the the month
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.520]   You were born your star sign and that happened. It takes 2.1 days
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.280]   You get an electromagnetic
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.640]   amplification in your body because of certain elements that are in your brain
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:56.160]   And when that happens you can utilize your time and a specific energy practice to
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.600]   optimize your energy flow and that will then have a cascading effect leading on to
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.400]   physical body changes
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:13.480]   Self-cleaning self detox cleaning out the mental patterns of the mind
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.040]   and
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.880]   Yeah, just kind of clearing out all of the blockages of the body. So as you start practicing it more and more
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.800]   every month every year you can then
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.560]   Build your your consciousness
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.600]   As well. Yeah, so is it safe to say
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.840]   My background bio electrical magnetic quantum energy bio fields
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.960]   Tuning and sort of so forth. So I think it is it safe to say that we all are energy energy beings
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.680]   And we have our own bio field. We live in an environment that has its own bio field
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.000]   Let's say the earth and and then you know because we're living symbolically with the earth
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.840]   We're sort of like you know aligned with the earth
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:03.120]   You know the earth's own magnetic and energy field and then so you're saying that we're also if we are doing
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.120]   Or have a specific goal for health in mind
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:12.400]   If we take into consideration the concepts that we you know that we're energetic beings and that if we align ourselves
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:21.720]   Our own bio fields align it with the earth and align it with the stars that we can amplify or optimize the the results from the efforts that we're making
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:29.500]   In what a red thing. Okay, so it all does tie together. It's all bio electrical magnetics. Okay, so if you align
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:36.400]   And it's together. Wow. Okay. Well, it and it's also like you you know, you you flow with the flow
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.040]   Okay
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.960]   So, you know if we take the geocentric model of earth, which we'll see in a slide
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.760]   That means the earth is in the center of our local
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.820]   Galaxy right with the planets going around. Oh, yeah, this one and
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:59.720]   You can see external to the earth. We have the moon orbit and then external to that this mercury
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.200]   Venus and the Sun and so
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.800]   this certain practice is talking about
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:11.720]   the relationship between the Sun and the moon and the earth and the human and
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.520]   So in the center of this diagram
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.440]   This is earth. This is where humans live, right?
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.520]   and
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.720]   We stand on the earth which has its electromagnetic
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:29.880]   bio field that is larger than us because the earth is larger than the human body and
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:36.200]   Then obviously the moon and the Sun are orbiting this earth and they're larger than us again
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   So they're going to have an a cosmic
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:45.160]   influence on the turmeric or earthly realm and the human is basically
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.120]   You know with your feet on the earth and your hands stretching towards the heavens
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:59.120]   We are the conduit between these two forces that are greater than us, but we can bring these forces into our body to help
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.400]   recharge and discharge
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.000]   energies
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.080]   And both directions so we can bring in from the cosmos move it through our body push it into the earth and in the opposite direction
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.160]   We can pull it from the earth and then discharge it out to the cosmos
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.160]   So this is creating this kind of toroidal field
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:24.360]   That we can harmonize our personal toroidal field with the turmeric earthly and cosmic
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.000]   forces and as that moon
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.400]   Goes around the earth. So they say it's all up for debate these days as well, isn't it?
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:38.960]   but 28.5 days makes a lunar month and
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.600]   The Sun takes one orbit around the earth and that takes
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.360]   360 days in the old calendars 365 days in the new
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:58.120]   360 makes more sense because it is a circle with angles of light which is the Sun
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:08.880]   So these two circuits in harmony make up the solar lunar calendar, which is a calendar involving
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.760]   the 360 Sun
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.800]   rotation
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.960]   split into 12 is 12 months or 12 zodiac and
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:25.080]   Then the moon because it takes 28.5 days to go around the earth
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:31.760]   If we put that into how long it takes to how many it can do in one year we get 13 months
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.400]   So in one of those solar
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.400]   Zodiac months you'll get an occurrence where the moon will transit a
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.120]   zodiac sign twice and
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:50.040]   So that's how the the 13 month and the 12 month calendar. They actually work together. They're not separate
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:58.960]   So that's kind of what I have learned while I've been writing about this and studying and trying to figure out what's going on
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.040]   I'm like, ah
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:06.140]   Because I've read a lot of people. They're like, oh the solar calendar is bad and the lunar calendar is good
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:13.920]   No, they're actually showing us that it's a system with interlocking parts and if we can
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:21.660]   Make observances of ourselves inside this the influences of the system. We can start to really
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:29.560]   Become and harmony with our external environment that affects our internal environment and when we can harmonize those two
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:37.600]   We are then not fighting the flow and we're not causing stress on our electromagnetic fields and therefore
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:45.700]   When our bodies are sleeping we can heal and when we're eating we can digest and you know, all of the things that we're meant to be able to do
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:53.000]   And overcome all of the the other influences that we're having to battle all the new influences like
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.320]   Wi-fi fields and toxins and
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.960]   Crepey water and all of that stuff. Yeah, it's a bit stronger
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:08.680]   Yeah, you know, so there's multiple concepts here that I kind of want to just touch on because each one of them could probably be
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.160]   Like a one-hour to our video
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.680]   But the first one was the whole concept of terminology that we were just talking about a second ago
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:20.240]   If we could kind of jump back to that and then I'd like to jump back into this particular talk because this is more like a
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.440]   Right up my alley, you know more about how to a type of description
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.900]   but I kind of want to emphasize to anyone listening that there's a there's a
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:35.480]   honest books are on the subject of the terminology of the Bible codes and apparently
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:40.800]   On a kid you kind of just briefly described like how did you discover that?
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.480]   the ancient texts are literally, you know
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.200]   Metaphorically and you know and also in parable but all of these different
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.680]   stories and verb and verb about in a verbiage that's used in these texts are
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.320]   actually
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.520]   Healing health guides for humanity, right? But they're in code
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.480]   And then how did you discover that code because that's the term Christ oil, right?
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.840]   And then you know Christos and things like that. So can you just share real quick like cuz you have a whole book on that?
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.480]   But how would you condense that to have five minutes?
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:24.040]   Well, the first time I heard about raising the Christ oil with them. It's also called raising the chrisom or the sacred secretion. Yeah, I
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:31.120]   First heard about that on Santos Bonacci's channel on his YouTube channel. He's you know
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:37.480]   Master of syncretism in Chinese medicine. We call syncretism concordances, which is basically
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:45.280]   The ability to see the pattern and match up that you know this archetype
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:53.320]   Maybe it's Jesus has this word that means the certain thing which means this in the anatomy and the physiology
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.880]   which relates to this
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.720]   fixed star which relates to this zodiac which relates to this
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.920]   mythological Bible story which relates to this
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:07.120]   mythological story and other cultures and I
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.800]   watched his stuff in 2015
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:16.840]   Which kind of got me seeing that he was using syncretism to describe
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.560]   works that I had not
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.600]   Red or had much interest in which was maybe more of the Western alchemical
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:30.280]   Teachings whereas I had been fresh out of study of the Eastern. But once I saw
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.720]   That they were the same pattern. I was like, oh, I totally get it. Okay, cool
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:43.880]   Also before that I had watched the film Zeitgeist in 2009 and that's showing a
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.880]   really great breakdown of
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.100]   the Jesus Christ story in terms of it being a solar
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:58.160]   Event in terms of it being related to the winter solstice
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.040]   sunrise and that is a cosmic event that
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:12.920]   Turns out that it looks like the Sun or if you replace the oh with the you the Sun the Sun the Sun of God
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:19.480]   It sits still on the horizon for about 2.1 days with I think it's the
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:28.000]   the Northern Cross above it as an alignment and it's showing that the Sun dies on the cross and stays on the horizon
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.320]   Not moving for 2.1 days and this has been mythologically explained in the Jesus Christ
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.200]   crucifixion resurrection
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.320]   stories
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.320]   mythologies so
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.440]   Looking at Zeitgeist is a really great way to
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:50.400]   Because they they basically tell it through the Jesus myth then they say oh, this is also Krishna
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:57.600]   This is also Horace and Osiris and Isis and it's repeated across cultures throughout time
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.920]   So once we can see that these characters are the same characters
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.320]   Then it all becomes really easy
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:13.400]   Yeah, it seems like the ancients or like you know like a lot of people that are into history or actual history
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.840]   not the manufactured one that's fed to us but the actual history it seems like you know
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:24.720]   We're a remnant society of of waves of humans that have inhabited the earth and eventually blown themselves up
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:32.240]   We got eliminated somehow, but there's always a survival group of people that survive it and then it we start up again, right?
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.000]   So it seems like to me the the ancients have left us a
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.640]   guide towards understanding
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:44.840]   you know reality as in terms of our physical presence and our energetic presence and and
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:52.080]   Just you know our perceived reality or just reality of us and understanding us understand healing and so forth
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.820]   So, you know, it's just it's just amazing that you because I hadn't run across what you ran across
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.140]   So I'm really intrigued by it and I just been kind of studying it this week
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:04.160]   So got tons of questions, but I did want to kind of throw that out there because anyone's who's listening
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:10.460]   It's probably just like myself has never even heard the phrase Christ. Oh, but I've heard of the the concept of the Christ frequency
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.280]   You know in terms of it of the concept that the code, you know
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.240]   All these ancient texts are literally, you know, just code
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:21.480]   For what and you know some people try to extrapolate all sorts of different meanings out of it
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.720]   But it makes a lot of sense when it's aligned with
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.280]   astrology, you know in terms of doing and you look at
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.400]   Astro
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:35.800]   Archaeology, right when you look at how all of the different ancient buildings and monuments and things are aligned with with the stars
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.920]   You know, you start really kind of wrapping this all up in the one package and say hey
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:46.560]   I think those guys those ancients left us they left us a blueprint for how to understand reality and and then how to you know
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.000]   Avoid right whatever happened to them
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.680]   It's even written into our our DNA, right the God code, but so I digress
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:18:04.880]   Just said because yeah, how this all came about. I've got a big section of this which is all about Ireland
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.920]   Okay, let's talk about that like how does this take like yeah, how does this tie to Ireland?
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.920]   Because you didn't want it, but you know like yeah, I just find that fascinating go ahead, please
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.560]   well that so
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:23.640]   All started was sorry laughing the way all started was I am
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.680]   I went to Ireland
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:31.720]   And if you can see the map of Ireland on the right side there, it's got these four
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:37.640]   Divisions and green and red and blue and yellow and this is the four provinces of the land
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.280]   And if you can view this land
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:46.600]   It is looking like a human body or a baby or a fetus or a bear facing west
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:51.160]   And so the red province of Ulster is technically the head
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.200]   and then the blue
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.480]   Arms out the front pointing west. It's the arms and the hands
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:06.600]   And then the green or now it's on the new map of lenster yellow. I'm just kind of sure. Sorry
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:20.040]   It's funny so lenster the green bit that's technically the
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:27.160]   the spine and the connection out of the spine plugging the nerves into the organs
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:34.040]   And of the torso and then the yellow bit that's essentially the lower part of the
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:40.600]   the organs in the torso of the body and the toes and the feet and the bottom of the spine the tailbone
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.160]   the orifices of the body
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.880]   so
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:53.560]   I kind of knew that a little bit before I went to Ireland, but I was not really thinking about it at all when I went to Ireland
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.600]   And then I
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.480]   I went into Dublin and then I went to a place called navan, which is just north of Dublin
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:06.520]   I got a campercar and I drove around the island the island of Ireland for 17 days
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.680]   and
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.000]   when I got back I was like
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Hang on a minute. The trajectory I just did
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Is actually something very significant and I'd never seen it before until I looked at
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.520]   my wall and on my bedroom of my house when I got back
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:31.160]   And I had this other painting next to it which you'll see on the left and it's a dalist artwork
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:36.440]   And it's called the nai jin too and it means the inner weaving or the inner warp
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.160]   And what you'll see is this island
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:49.720]   facing west with a head and a spine and waters in the lower and little people dotted around
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.560]   doing little jobs
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:57.480]   And when I looked at these two paint to maps essentially, I was like, oh my god
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.040]   The trajectory I did around Ireland
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:05.640]   Actually is a qigong exercise called the microcosmic orbit
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.160]   And so that means if we switch back to looking at the map of Ireland
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:17.000]   Dublin is located just under the word lenster in the green province of lenster
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.680]   And when you drive up that east coast, which I did and then I drove
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.880]   Through the the north of the north
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:30.760]   And then I went to the west coast and then I went a bit inland then I went back to the west coast
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.320]   And then I went a bit inland and then I drove
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:38.120]   All down the west coast and then I got to the counties of claire and limerick
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.160]   I went all the way down to kerry, which is the toes
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.560]   And I went through cork
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.360]   And then I went back up to to wicklow and Dublin and then I left and so
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:53.880]   That is a technically a microcosmic orbit, which is a qigong
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:58.440]   Movement, which is taught through dalism. So when I saw these two
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.840]   Islands next to each other I couldn't help but notice there were
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.960]   very strong similarities
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.680]   And because at that time
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.520]   I had been listening to some work by some
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.560]   father and son duo author
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.200]   Called konamek dari
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.600]   Mcdari konamek dari is actually a pen name
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.240]   But it's a father and son duo
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.840]   And the father wrote a book that was published in about 1923
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:31.480]   And it was called the wisdom preserved in bible and pyramids
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.920]   And inside that book he was basically saying that the original bible is irish
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.880]   So that's kind of
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:45.960]   All in the back story of what was bubbling inside my subconscious since 2016
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.400]   And I really really
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:55.800]   Wanted to one day explore whether or not this observation of this dalist painting
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.840]   And ireland had any
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:06.040]   Match-ups and last year in 2022 was when I finally committed to the decision and I took it as my full-time
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.760]   Job
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:14.360]   To to explore and then I started finding out all this cool stuff, which is
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:19.880]   You know ireland has the most megaliths in the world on any one land
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:23.320]   And there's
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.320]   All of these megaliths
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.920]   You know, as you mentioned before the buildings aligned with the cosmos
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.800]   They're all very very very aligned to
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:37.160]   Sort to solstice sunrises and sunsets and summer solstice sunrises and sunsets and
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:42.280]   The cross-quarter days of halloween, which is called soane
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.760]   and bell-time and
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.080]   This first day of spring it's all there and when we start looking
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:58.040]   At these megaliths in more detail and then we can match them up to all those the little characters that are on that dalist painting
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.280]   We can start seeing these really amazing correspondences between
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.920]   the megaliths
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.480]   Of ireland and the bible codes
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:13.000]   So it's like ireland is like the gobeki teki
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.520]   Yeah, I mean it's that's pretty cool. That is because in in the study
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:25.240]   I also read that a book by Rudolf Steiner called the electric doppelganger
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:30.200]   And in that book he's really inspecting and talking about the consciousness of the land
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.200]   And saying that different lands, you know
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.640]   That we all live in is the different continents and countries
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:43.800]   These lands have different vibrations and over time different energies live in these lands
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.080]   as sort of entities and
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.960]   And the land itself and so
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:55.800]   This land as humans live on it are receiving vibrations from these lands
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:02.120]   And all different lands give out different vibrations and all these different vibrations are telling different stories of different lands
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.760]   the history
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.080]   and so
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.720]   With that in mind Rudolf Steiner
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.320]   Was saying in his book that
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:19.720]   Ireland is the original garden of eden which relates it directly to the bible stories
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.520]   and he said that
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:28.680]   The there was the original garden of eden which was ireland and it was copied and it was put aside
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.400]   as an untouched pure paradise
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.960]   And then all of the humans
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.760]   Accordingly who got kicked out of paradise
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:42.280]   Ended up in the copy and this copy is what the infiltrator energy
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.080]   Has invaded and this is what we're in right now
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.040]   so um
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.760]   That's hard to know if it's true or not
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.760]   But if we do look back to you know all of the megaliths of ireland
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:26:01.640]   And the placements of them and then the relationships i've made between them and the bible
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.640]   And the anatomy and physiology using the daoist information
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:10.840]   We can see that there is a lot of biblical stuff there
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.560]   Yeah, and it all ties towards
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.520]   Just our consciousness and our our you know, I guess the
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.160]   electrical energy electric universe concept too as well, right?
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:30.280]   Yeah, and it's also showing essentially like a a microcosm of the electric
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.800]   Microcosm microcosm of the electric
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.480]   um
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:40.520]   magnetic movements of the of the body and it's literally showing a blueprint
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.680]   of how to do the raising of the christ oil as um
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:48.680]   an energy movement process of inner alchemy
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.520]   Okay
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.640]   So the ancients left us a blueprint
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.200]   That got replicated in multiple different philosophies and religions
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.480]   And the blueprint is physically represented in ireland
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.360]   But then it then from the daoists and the other
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:09.400]   uh different, uh, you know, ancients also extrapolated that knowledge and put it into
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:14.040]   These different philosophies and so now the which is totally cool
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.800]   But I got a quesite question though
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:20.280]   When when the individual in ireland said that the original bible came from ireland
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.120]   Was that the colbrid bible because i've read about that one
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:29.160]   Which was a no, I tried to look into the colbrid bible, but i haven't gone in there with
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:34.120]   With with my full attention yet. Yeah, the mondari work which i mentioned
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.240]   Oh, you have looked at it. Well, yeah, I actually got the uh copy of the original
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.320]   There's actually a fake one that was put out by
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.960]   You know typical usurpers, right?
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:50.280]   But the original a copy of the actual original one was like basically held in a monastery
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.920]   And then they started publishing it
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.440]   Uh recently and but if you go on amazon, you'll buy this other one that's fake
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.760]   But the actual original one that you can get
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:02.280]   Directly from this convent group
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:07.800]   I think they have an online where they sell books, but but anyway, so I got to hold the original colbrid bible
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.040]   And started reading it was just really hard to read though because it's just you know, it's your typical
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:19.160]   Ancient tech so I just I couldn't comprehend it actually myself, but I'm aware of it. I'm aware of its story
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.280]   Um, and I learned about the colbrid bible from dr
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.320]   Uh, but again, I see was it uh
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.160]   I'll get back to it
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:31.240]   But there's this other professor of physics that you know it kind of was into the whole concept of
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.960]   Of of our planet and things like that and develop koski books and things like that
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.160]   And he was he actually was talking about the colbrid himself
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:44.840]   Saying that the colbrid ties more into the reality of of our history
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.880]   Then the new that will you know the other bible that everybody accepts is the book of christianity
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.200]   So anyway, so that's a whole site subject, but I just I was wondering if that was the one he was referring to
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:59.000]   Um because that was one language was that written then originally before it
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.800]   Gaelic
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.800]   Oh, well there you go. Yeah
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:08.760]   And I and irish in the irish tongue right so and isn't that also the home of the druids
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.480]   And their entire missusism and all of their
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.160]   You know and you know what I do know
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:21.400]   A little bit about druidism as it's basically about uh harmonizing with nature, which is nowism
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:26.120]   Yeah, they're all they're all yeah. They're all literally they're holistic healers. They're like shamans. Yeah
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.760]   Yeah, that's like a matriarchal
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:35.320]   Knowledge of the interchange between the negative and positive polarity. Yeah
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.680]   It's just unrises and sets. Yeah
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:42.280]   It makes a lot of sense because of everything that I've ever read
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:47.640]   When I'd but I never put the pieces together until you started telling you know until you I started watching your videos
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.040]   But yeah, it makes a lot of sense
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.280]   Given the history of this island
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:58.440]   Um and also some of the other books that I read where you know when you look at like the monoliths that are built
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.560]   They're even stone hedge over on on the great britain, but those
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.840]   Monuments were built at a time
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:09.720]   When the people supposedly were still in furs and nomadic
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:14.680]   So where did you know, yeah, written right? So where where did the people come?
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.880]   Where did they come from landed on britain and built that thing?
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:23.480]   And so then there's that tie right and there's also another tie. I have I found another book that talked about
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.000]   um
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.280]   how the
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.120]   Egyptian society all of that incredible pyramid building culture
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:34.680]   Didn't come from middle east it came from ireland. So that's real interesting
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.680]   I'm just I'm just kind of going off on a side tangent
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:42.280]   But I just find all of this ancient history stuff so fascinating because we weren't taught in school
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:48.040]   What the real history was we're all on our own journey to find it, you know, and for you to find this link between
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.880]   Ireland
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:55.320]   But you know this physical blueprint left on on earth by the ancients and how it all ties into daoism
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.120]   And then how it ties into healing, but it's so cool
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.880]   So my next question knows is that how to question right? So let's say
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:12.440]   For any one of us, we're all working on different things, you know, like whether it's uh, you know, people trying to or i have a child
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:17.560]   People trying to overcome a disease, you know, so forth people trying to get through trauma
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.440]   how you know, how do you actually do that when when uh
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.600]   And would you say that trying to overcome these challenges?
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.320]   Is that considered raising the christ oil?
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.960]   Like trying to connect to universe
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:35.560]   Because obviously in my mind okay great because my mind the first step to healing
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.920]   Right is to is to find that inner balance and put your your being into a healing state
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.720]   So is that kind of is that the correct interpretation?
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.560]   Yeah, well, there's there's multiple facets to self-healing isn't there because
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:55.080]   You know, you you dive into one aspect of yourself, which is okay. I've got a physical blockage
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:02.520]   I need to sort that out how am I going to do that? Oh, I can do post-electro magnetic field therapy or my sore knee
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.600]   But then if I apply
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:11.240]   magnesium oil and iodine and that's going to add minerals or elements and to help the healing process
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:16.760]   So once I've healed my sore knee now i'm able to walk and exercise and then I can go and
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:23.800]   Enjoy my life more which is going to make me more emotionally balanced and happy and less in my mind because i'm using my physical body
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:31.080]   So we have these physical mental emotional spiritual needs which all have to be harmonized
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:36.600]   through the clearing out of blockages of
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:41.320]   Any one of those areas will help the other areas
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.080]   Free themselves up to which then allows us to look
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:53.000]   More deeply more inwardly once we start getting to know our own body on a more intimate
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.200]   relationship
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.520]   And that is a relationship that we build through self-participation, right?
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.400]   We become our own doctors and our own healers
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.640]   And mostly because we want to fix something about ourselves
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.240]   You know, we've got a problem and we were looking for answers
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:16.200]   And then we find something super cool like electro healing or whatever and then we're like, oh that resonates with me
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:22.600]   I'm going to do that and then suddenly you're helping yourself and then helping others and sharing and then you start adding into your toolbox
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.280]   And then you've got
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.080]   All this extra stuff coming coming up all the time
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.240]   So that's
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:33.640]   You know where you want to start and that is where you where you end up
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:38.920]   And then it's kind of like peeling open petals of a flower as you go
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.800]   And realizing and realizing and realizing
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:46.120]   Yeah, so okay. So how do you incorporate this discovery?
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.760]   Um, I'm going to go back up to this
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.720]   this daoist map
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:58.600]   And I'm assuming that you're your your basic training, you know in Chinese traditional medicine and air vetics
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:03.560]   And it all ties together in terms of alignment
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:09.960]   Right. So how do you take what you know, this idea of raising the christal of aligning with the stars?
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:15.240]   The astrological alignment of your of the moon in your particular
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:19.480]   Uh, you know, I guess the astrological sign, right? That's what we're saying
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.640]   And how do you align that to you know treating patients?
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:29.240]   Well, if we go down two slides, okay
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.160]   Yeah, this is a cool um
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:37.480]   because the best way to you know
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:45.960]   Try and get heads around all this it's a lot of complicated information in a way, but it does have a pattern. Yeah, yeah, okay
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.840]   on this um
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.840]   This wheel on the right hand side. This is a wheel. It says 12
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.920]   zodiac
[00:34:54.920 --> 00:35:00.120]   mineral cell salts wheel created by a lady called yudora and nays perry
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.520]   And her husband wrote a book on the raising of the christ oil called godman
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:09.160]   And his name was george kerry. So he was a physician. So
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:16.040]   This wheel is the zodiac and so the zodiac is what is called fixed stars
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:20.520]   And it's in 12 divisions. So it's that 360 circle
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.720]   Of one orbit split into 12
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.440]   And within those 12 sections we find
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:31.080]   installations and those constellations have certain formations
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:36.440]   Which look like certain animals because the zodiac actually means the wheel of the animals
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.760]   And so on that we're going to find animals like leo the lion
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:43.400]   Or cancer the crab or scorpion
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:47.640]   Some of them are people some of them are other symbols
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.120]   and
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.120]   That is basically
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.560]   You know the 12 months of the year and when you were born
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.920]   You were born in one of those months and that means that you're a certain
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.920]   Star sign
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.760]   Right and then
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.200]   You know with astrology, they've got a whole system which is developing
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:11.320]   You know personal characteristics based on archetypes to know about your
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:16.040]   Personality your job your career your life path is all of that stuff
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.640]   um
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.400]   but in terms of
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.640]   raising the christ oil
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.960]   um
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.960]   This is all about
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:31.160]   The month you were born in and also the month you were conceived in
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.200]   So
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.200]   For example, I was born in
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:40.920]   october, which is scorpio, but my conception month if you go back
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:47.320]   Three clicks on the dial that would have been one two three, which is aquarius
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:54.920]   So you go in clockwise from scorpio one two three, that's aquarius and so
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.400]   this um
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.400]   That would be my conception month
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.800]   And then the scorpio would be my birth month
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:06.520]   And so we've got these two things to account for in the self healing
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.760]   which
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.760]   Has biblical ties as well
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.720]   but basically
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.680]   When the
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.520]   moon
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:23.320]   Comes into a conjunction with this with the sign you were born in
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:29.720]   So for example me scorpio when the moon comes into scorpio it will stay in scorpio
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:36.200]   Region because the fixed stars around the the wheel. It's kind of like you could imagine it
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.760]   It's like a projector
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:44.520]   Hovering around the earth sky and it clicks around and it clicks around and it clicks around and it takes
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.160]   For one full orbit of all of those 12 animals it takes 25
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.960]   Thousand eight hundred years
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.360]   To go through all 12
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.880]   And so they're always slightly moving and as we know the earth is moving
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.680]   The sun and the moon and the planets are all moving
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:09.400]   But there's constellations are called the fixed stars because even though they're moving they don't change their position in relation to each other
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.320]   So we can rely that on them as being a constant
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.200]   fixed pattern
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.200]   and so when
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.120]   the moon aligns with our example of scorpio
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.520]   um
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.040]   That will the moon will stay in scorpio for 2.1 days
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:32.760]   And then after 2.1 days it will go into Sagittarius
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.920]   and then after 2.1 days it will go into Capricorn and
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:40.280]   Then the moon will do every single star sign
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.160]   within a month
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.240]   and so
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.280]   in that particular time of that 2.1 days
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.880]   Because the moon is conjuncting with the earth
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.480]   And the sun and that star sign that you were born in
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.440]   When what we know about the moon coming
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:04.280]   You know in conjunction with earth is that it has a compression effect, which is called gravity
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.600]   It's
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:10.680]   Squeezing on the earth and that causes the waters of the earth to bulge out
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:15.000]   And then this is causing basically an electromagnetic
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   uh
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.160]   Change and then that is affecting the waters inside our own bodies
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.760]   and
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:27.400]   A lot of that water that it's been affected is the cerebral spinal fluid
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.760]   as it flows in and out of the brain stem
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:33.800]   and
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.360]   What is important to know about the brain
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:43.480]   Is that the cerebellum or the cerebral cortex or the bit of the brain that's directly under the skull
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.640]   That looks like all that gray matter
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:51.240]   And then inside all that gray matter, there's all of the control room of the brain with all the different systems
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.320]   That's a
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.320]   cerebral cortex
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:00.040]   The gray matter and a bit of gray matter the very back of the
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.960]   occiput
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.920]   Called the cerebellum the little brain both of those
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.680]   and tissues have a lot of
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.880]   uh
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.880]   an element called magnetite
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:17.320]   And magnetite is one of the most magnetic substance. It is the most magnetic element in the world
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.720]   So
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.520]   This is where it comes into the electromagnetic
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.280]   Enhancement
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.400]   So the external force of the moon and harmony was
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:32.120]   the month you were born in which affects you because of your birth time and your particular
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.520]   arrangement of
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.800]   constellations that affects your pattern
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:43.000]   When all that happens you get a surge of
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.200]   I guess a magnetic force affecting the magnetite in your brain
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.920]   And what we know about electromagnetic
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:56.520]   Physics is that when you apply a magnetic field
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.320]   to um
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.480]   The electron flow it's going to help the electrons flow through the circuit more optimally
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.640]   more efficiently
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:10.680]   And so those electrons are in the cerebral spinal fluid and they're also
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.080]   Obviously in the whole body, but particularly in this um
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:18.040]   spine and brainstem and brain
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.160]   And this is going to cause
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:25.400]   um all sorts of hormonal and neurotransmission
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.160]   Accelerations
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:31.160]   and then we can
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.880]   Also, there's all of this other stuff that comes into
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.760]   This which is that many people
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.800]   Think or have supposed that this process of raising the Christ oil
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.240]   um
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.440]   is
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:49.240]   Optimizing dmt dimethyl tryptolene to be released in the pineal gland
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.600]   Which is basically the radio station of the brain
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.240]   Which gives us that psychic
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.280]   communication system
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.760]   And so what I've found is that it may
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:06.680]   Most likely not be dmt in the pineal gland, but more to do with the lungs
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.960]   Which is to do with breathing and also the electrification
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.200]   Of the spinal fluid which can carry dmt through it
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:19.160]   So
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:23.240]   Yeah, yeah, so um lots of questions. So the optimal time
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:27.240]   Is that going to be in your conception month or your birth month or both?
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.360]   So like
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:34.840]   The activation will happen in your birth month. Okay
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:38.840]   And then from now, this is like the gum shirt. Go ahead
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:44.200]   Oh, so, you know how I said 2.1 days for each sign
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:49.720]   Uh, when when the moon goes from your birth sign
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.160]   And then it finally gets into your conception sign
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.960]   That is a process of seven days
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.840]   seven days of creation
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:06.360]   Okay, and is that a window of time to try to focus on a particular issue or should
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.000]   if someone wanted to try to
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.400]   Optimize this this this concept to focus specifically on those two days that the moon is in their
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.640]   uh birth
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.640]   month or birth sign
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:24.920]   Well, this is one little handy tip that I found out through going
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.640]   Through the bible stuff
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:32.600]   Um, so the 2.1 days is basically the jesus christ
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:36.840]   The essence the seed the spirit is being born
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:41.480]   being conceived being born inside your body and side your
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.880]   uh bodily substances and it has to be cultivated
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:47.720]   and
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:50.200]   It has to be pulled up from
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.080]   It is basically born
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.640]   in the manger at bethlohim
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.880]   which is relating to
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.120]   the saliva
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:03.960]   The swallowing of saliva and the stomach
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:08.520]   So the stomach is bethlohim because bethlohim means house of bread and meat
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:16.440]   And the manger at bethlohim the manger means crib where the baby lives, but it also means the place of chewing
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.560]   and so
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:23.720]   It is important obviously to have the correct mineral balance
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:26.440]   within your body so you can produce
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.880]   a healthy quality
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.480]   Jesus baby seed of them. Does it make sense?
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.760]   Sort of i'm struggling here
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:41.560]   I have never studied astrology in my whole life. So i'm completely a novice
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:44.280]   what i'm trying to figure out right is like
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:49.240]   As as in you kind of hit on something that's really a big thing for me this year
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:55.160]   Which is i'm really trying to awaken my my third eye this year. That's kind of like my personal goal
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:59.720]   And so i'm trying to understand, you know, how would i accomplish that
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.600]   Or at least you know give it a good try
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:07.000]   Applying the concept of raising you know the christ oil so
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.200]   So if i get if i get you correctly
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:14.840]   Um, it's this there's a seven day window every month
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:20.760]   Where you're you know the moon is within your conception and birth science, right?
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.440]   and then
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:27.640]   If i were to try to let's say focus on my third eye awakening efforts that i do
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:32.920]   Uh, it's not as is at any time in those seven days is where i should focus that effort
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:38.840]   Or is it specifically like, you know in that in the conception two day period
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:44.200]   Like like how do i actually apply this towards greater healing?
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.640]   So the conception
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.200]   Uh
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.200]   Sort of the inner conception
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:57.960]   And that that month you're born from for that scorpion example. That's me
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.680]   The moon will be in there for 2.1 days
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:06.200]   And this is when you get that electro magnetic amplification, right?
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:11.560]   And this is when you would do the qigong exercise called the microcosmic orbit, okay
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.760]   And so the microcosmic orbit
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.440]   um
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.440]   Involves moving energy
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.760]   from the
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.320]   Have you heard of danteans in qigong?
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.200]   No, i haven't heard of that
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:31.320]   Okay, so and for example the head or the third eye that's the upper
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:37.720]   The heart is the middle and the reproductive organs is the lower
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.840]   and these are regions of
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:44.360]   energy centers, which the chinese daoists called dantean
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.840]   They also call them cauldrons
[00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:50.680]   And in malle healing they're called the three hearts
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.800]   And these are basically energy centers
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.480]   um
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:58.920]   located in between the seven chakras and
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:04.120]   The qigong microcosmic orbit exercise
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.720]   Is basically moving energy from the lower
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.240]   Through the up through the middle to the upper
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:16.520]   and then back to the middle and then down to the lower and then
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:19.160]   and that's doing that
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:21.320]   through the
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.760]   spine
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:29.160]   And there's two meridians on the spine one goes up the back and one goes down the front and they meet in the mouth
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.720]   and they meet at the tailbone
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.440]   and so
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.440]   doing this practice
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.880]   is
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:43.400]   Basically optimizing the electromagnetic energy flow through the circuit
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:46.360]   of these two meridians
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:50.760]   Yeah, you see them down there as the red and the blue
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.400]   Oh, okay
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.400]   I get it. Okay
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:48:01.400]   One important piece of this practice is that you see in the top of the head in the red
[00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:04.280]   um
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.280]   It's got the nose and the mouth
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.080]   And so the nose and the mouth
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:12.600]   Is basically what we could consider as a spark gap
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:19.960]   So a spark gap in electro magnetics. We use it to discharge energy in the circuit, right?
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.720]   Mm-hmm
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:27.640]   So to open and close the circuit you can see this image. He's got the tongue touching the roof of the mouth. Okay. Yeah
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.320]   And that is the um keeping the circuit closed
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.600]   Right
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.160]   Yeah, actually was actually was training qi kung
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:37.800]   I remember doing this. I just forgot the name of it
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:43.400]   So you breathe in through your nostrils or you breathe in through your mouth and you blow out through your nostrils with your tongue
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.880]   touching the top of your mouth, right?
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:50.680]   Pretty much and at the beginning of this you can do a few pelvic floor
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:56.760]   Uh crunches or kegels to try and touch the other end of the circuit together
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:59.320]   as well
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.680]   um
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.680]   So that's the basics
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:08.280]   Of it, but if you do this microcosmic orbit when the moon's in your sign
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:13.240]   That's when you get the harmonic between you and the earth and the cosmos
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.680]   Okay
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.920]   So then once you connect and create that harmonic between you and the cosmos
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:25.000]   And let's say you're trying to work on third eye awakening or a lot of folks, you know, they're working on
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.480]   um, you know releasing trauma
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.320]   Is that when you would then once you then align yourself
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:36.440]   Uh through this qi kung practice then the next step would be is to
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:39.960]   Uh to do a treatment of some kind whether it's
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:44.840]   You know using 24x or or you know, like is that the next step
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.040]   No, the the this
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:52.040]   This is basically the treatment. This is the treatment. Oh, okay
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.600]   So
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.600]   Why get it? Okay, they just hit me
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:00.200]   That just okay. I just this is a free energy treatment
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:06.680]   You know when you connect the cosmos. Okay. Okay. I get it. This is the treatment. I'm just overly complicated it
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.960]   I've got so many toys that I just have to play with all of them, right?
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:14.200]   So I'm thinking all right. I do this. I do this. I grab my two new fork and my mobile my modulator
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:20.280]   I mean, you can see but I over complicate things too. I'm just trying to like
[00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:25.480]   Where do we start to explain this but the simplicity of it is that it is an orbit
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:32.280]   It's a circuit that happens within you and if you do it at the certain time of the month, that's the healing
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:35.160]   That is the healing
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.360]   I'll get it
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:41.560]   I will tell you something interesting about this because you mentioned before I like what people want to get out of this
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.400]   And you said some people want to get pregnant, right?
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.040]   Yeah, that's a big deal
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:51.240]   When the moon enters your sign and causes this electromagnetic amplification
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:54.200]   Which you can use for healing if you do this
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.480]   Microcosmic orbit to optimize that
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.760]   This is also called the lunar peak
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:06.200]   Um, which is a very fertile time for men and women
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:11.080]   And a woman can literally release the second egg in this period
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:14.760]   so
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:17.640]   So even if she's just had a ovulation or period
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:22.920]   Or if she's on it on her period, she can still release an egg right then
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.400]   um, so this is
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.200]   Um, I've I've referenced this in my book
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:35.560]   Because one doctor started he was had an interest in astrology and he wanted to help catholic woman
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:37.400]   not
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.920]   Have too many babies
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:44.120]   And uh, he found out that when he found out their birthday and started working with their astrology
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.360]   He could predict when they would be most fertile
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:50.840]   And so people have now we've been using it in the opposite direction, which is to help people
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:52.840]   uh, conceived
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:54.360]   Okay
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.840]   All right, that's pretty amazing. So
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.720]   Um, very amazing
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:05.080]   Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty wild right now because yeah, I you know, I I did she come as a young guy and uh
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:09.480]   I got all the energy benefits out of it and proved health and so forth
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.720]   But I never thought about it from this standpoint
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:17.240]   I wasn't as I didn't know as much back then but okay, so this is really cool. Um,
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:25.640]   So what do you recommend for people like so should so the recommendation honestly is to improve your health improve your well-being?
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.280]   um
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:31.000]   Practice the microcosmic orbit chikung
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.840]   method
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:38.280]   On on the days that your moon your moon is in your sign. Is that kind of what it comes down to?
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:42.440]   It is on a very basic level it is
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.440]   um
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:49.240]   Depending on where you're at everyone's going to have a different experience with this
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:52.120]   And depending on what you have to do
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:55.640]   Uh with your life in those days you're going to have
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:58.680]   uh different experience
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:03.960]   Um, and there's certain things I've noticed about my own experience because I've been doing it
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:07.320]   Uh, every month for the last 14 months
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.280]   every month is different and
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:16.440]   There are certain things that I would recommend to not do and to do
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:22.360]   So a recommendation is that you very much should be touching your feet to the earth
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:26.200]   While you're doing this. Yeah, that's what I was gonna I was gonna ask you that
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:32.600]   I'm just looking for this obviously everybody if you just go on youtube you can see individuals practicing
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:35.080]   this microcosmic orbits you'll know
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.120]   Uh how to do it and then
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:42.680]   I've actually made some videos on my channel about it a bit more as well. Take a peek
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:45.880]   So there's heaps of information
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:48.360]   Online
[00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:54.760]   Yeah, this is uh, honest youtube channel. Okay, so then you've got your own. Do you actually do demonstrations?
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:54:00.600]   Uh, not yet. It's more just about showing the deeper energetics behind
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.680]   um
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:09.160]   Moving the energy up your spine into your brain. Where's the acupuncture points? Where are these energy centers?
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.040]   um
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:17.880]   You know, how does it involve dmt? What's going on for the psychic stuff?
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.280]   Okay
[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.400]   Okay
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:23.400]   Okay, so make the instructions
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:26.600]   All right, we're just talking and images
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:31.320]   Okay, so uh go to yeah, so they for those of you who are interested in trying this
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:36.600]   I'm definitely going to going to my next question is for people who are not astrologists
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.240]   Or know anybody who is
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:42.680]   How do you find out when you're when the moon is in your sign?
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:49.480]   You just google it. So there's there's a very awesome website called moon tracks.com
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:52.520]   you go there
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.480]   and
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.440]   Okay, here we go
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:09.240]   On that that golden tab you just go to the second
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:16.760]   One called astrology calendar 2023. Yes, this one. Okay. What's your what's your star sign?
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:19.560]   Um, aries
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:22.760]   Aries so let's look for areas. That's on
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.800]   21st
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.800]   Right here
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:30.120]   Yeah, so it's his moon arrow aries
[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:34.920]   And that happens at 913 p.m. But this is an
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:38.600]   Pst time
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:42.760]   So that is probably your time zone, right? No, I'm i'm three hours
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.560]   uh ahead of the hours
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:50.440]   So that means and this this is the key for it as well with people
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:53.400]   You have to convert that time
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:54.280]   Okay
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:57.480]   Into your time zone. So I use time
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:01.960]   Or does it time zone converter calculator? They have quite a lot of tools
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:05.160]   Yeah, um, I use time and so you
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:09.560]   Oh, yes, that's the same one. I think yeah, so
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.120]   Type in really see
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:16.520]   And then type in pst, which is the time that the websites
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:24.440]   And so that I know right now it's nine o'clock here and it's seven. So there are two hours before me. I guess
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:27.400]   So that would be
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.560]   Or on two hours ahead of them. So it'd be like
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.880]   1113 at night on the 21st
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.000]   Is when the moon goes into Aries so at that moment
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.520]   And would it be the rest of these like these two days here is the two days that the
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:43.560]   Yes, you can see the 22nd the 23rd
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:46.200]   and then on the um
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.200]   and then just after
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:51.240]   Like a void of course
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.880]   Now you've got to look for the blue writing
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:57.800]   So go down to the 24th and you see the moon arrows to torus
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:05.000]   Okay, so that's telling us that the moon is now going to torus and that's the next sign. So that means the moon is leaving
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.840]   Aries. So this is the second time
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:11.880]   where
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:21.240]   The moon enters areas on the 21st and then after 2.1 days or approximately this is always taking about 52 51 hours
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:24.040]   Then the moon goes into the next sign
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.200]   and
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.200]   when this happens
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:31.560]   This from the 21st and then seven days
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:34.520]   after that, this is a time
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:43.720]   We so for the 2.1 days you can be practicing the microcosmic orbit and then after that, I mean you can practice it every day
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:49.240]   But after that, this is a very important time not to have uh alcohol
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.840]   or um
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:55.640]   What they call in the bible, unleavened bread
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:59.560]   So they have
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:03.960]   I didn't know about any bible stuff before I looked into this by the way, so
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:09.000]   It's like what I was bible stuff, but it's actually got a bit of a clue in there
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:15.320]   Which is don't eat leavened bread and what's leaven got in it. It's got a fungus bacteria
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:21.320]   Uh, which is a yeast and it performance and makes alcohol. So that's this
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:27.080]   Yeah, so it's a festival of unleavened bread that is occurring for seven days
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:31.160]   Uh, which is all related to this cosmological stuff
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:33.800]   um, but yeah, I've been
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.040]   Trying to bring it back into practicalities
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:43.640]   And because what you're you're doing in that 2.1 days is you're cultivating an energetic in your body
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:49.000]   You're cleaning your body. You're uh baptizing your inner waters of your body
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.560]   you're helping your body to
[00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:53.960]   release old
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.720]   old energies
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.160]   um
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:02.520]   And then after that you want to keep that new world vibration high
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:06.680]   Uh, so this is a period where you would not have
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:10.520]   alcohol or bread with leaven in it, which is kind of interesting
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:13.720]   because i've been looking at this period between
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:17.400]   the birth day
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.400]   and the conception which is
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:25.880]   Uh, these seven days after is that period of seven days to create the world
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:30.040]   Okay, that's really interesting
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:32.920]   um
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:36.840]   Yeah, okay. I'm just trying to figure out like okay, so if this is the
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:42.200]   Treatment that it basically energizes your body. So then your body starts doing
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.400]   Its thing right it starts healing what it needs to heal
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:49.640]   And then also applies to trauma and to other
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:54.680]   Things that you know, you're that your body, you know, yeah, you need your body to do
[00:59:54.680 --> 01:00:01.480]   But then when it comes to like and then even with conception your body's going to be more, you know, I guess uh, uh, you know
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.680]   fertile
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:06.440]   Uh or prepared, but what about like if you had an intention
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.280]   Like you have you have an intention where you want to lose weight
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:14.840]   How would you apply something like that to to this practice?
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:19.640]   Like, you know, would you just meditate on it during this period of time? It's
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:25.160]   To kind of you know, I said, um, you wanting to do that into your bio field
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.880]   Yeah, yeah, if you don't mind
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.960]   Well and and the sort of slides i've got
[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:38.280]   Remember that chinese daoist painting that looks like island Ireland Ireland that is an island
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.520]   Uh, this one
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:46.360]   So this has got little characters inside and they're actually all of the organs of the body and they're doing jobs
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:52.600]   Um, which i've explained in my my books is so much detail. It's a
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.680]   um
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.520]   but once
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:00.280]   This is a daoist painting that teaches
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.080]   you
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:07.080]   A way to use this is a tool to imprint this onto your body
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.640]   To use as a visualization tool
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:19.160]   So while you're doing this microcosmic orbit, you know, any kind of qigong or meditation or qigong is different from meditation because it's active
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:22.040]   But when you're doing
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.160]   qigong
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:29.960]   You know that you're doing this movement because it moves this meridian to open the organ charge to help your
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.200]   body be
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.000]   Charging energy to that particular organ while you do your
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.040]   Your stretch with your arm and your leg
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.960]   so
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.000]   While we learn qigong we also learn that the movement
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.280]   helps the internal organ, right?
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.640]   right so
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:54.040]   this little painting is all of our internal organs and
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:02:00.040]   The whole point of self-healing that has been helpful to me in my journey. It has been
[01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.760]   um
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.760]   Making it fun
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.240]   making like
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:13.480]   You like when you think about your body and you think about there's all these little consciousnesses in there and they're all called cells
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.480]   And they're all doing little jobs
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.240]   And you've got your organs and they've got consciousnesses and they're doing jobs
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:23.240]   That you're meridians to help flow energy to the organs and everything's alive
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.080]   everything's
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:30.440]   moving around everything's bubbling or heating or cooling or steaming or
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:35.880]   Chewing digesting it's all going on. It's very active
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.720]   It's just like living in nature, right?
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:44.600]   And so once we start to familiarize ourselves with our internal workings then we can start telling them what to do
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.040]   Ah
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.880]   okay
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:55.320]   All right, so did you did you see that video of me talking about telling my thyroid what to do?
[01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:01.080]   Yeah, well, is that when you had the cold belly the video on cold belly?
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:05.160]   No, it was another one basically I had a lump in my thyroid
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:09.640]   And I told my body what to do talking directly to all my little cells
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:12.920]   And because I know a little bit about anatomy and physiology
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.560]   I was able to visualize
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:19.800]   That and I told myself what to do. I told them all to start breaking up
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.840]   uh the lump
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:29.160]   And going through the body and to be digested or urinated out of my body or passing out as a waste product
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.160]   And I told my body what to do with my speaking voice
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.920]   Out loud
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.240]   While I was laughing because it was so hilarious
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.760]   um
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.960]   And as I as I talked to my body and told it what to do
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.160]   Uh, the thyroid lump disappeared within 10 minutes
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.480]   Wow
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:53.720]   Okay, so to answer your question about like how would I use this for helping my own health lose weight whatever
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.120]   Okay
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.880]   You want to use these
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.200]   Taoist tools, you know, you've got the tool of
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.720]   The microcosmic orbit, which is the energetical movement
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:08.200]   And you've got the tool of that really beautiful painting showing all your little organs
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.440]   And then you can apply that as a holographic overlay visual
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:16.520]   And then you get into your body at this 2.1 days
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:20.840]   Window of time where the moon enters your sign where you're amplified
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:26.600]   And then you can sit there and be like, right guys. Here's what we're doing everyone listen up
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.960]   We're going to be moving energy from the base of the tailbone
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:34.520]   Up the spine through the cerebral spinal fluid when it gets to this point
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:39.720]   It's going to do this and it's going to feed energy into my digestive system, which is going to optimize
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:44.360]   And detoxify and you know, you can start
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:49.960]   Doing that and I do recommend learning a bit of anatomy and physiology
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:54.360]   Because it's going to bring you the tools to understand your own inner mechanics
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:59.080]   Right. You need to forgive your body correct the correct instructions
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:05.320]   Okay, I get it. Okay. This is so cool. Um, it's a lot. I mean, it's it's this is like
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:10.600]   Multiple encyclopedias all crammed into 60 minutes of talking to you. I'm trying to
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.040]   I'm doing my brain is
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.360]   Literally swimming. I get everything you're saying
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:19.960]   I think I just need to process it. It makes sense, but man, there's a lot of stuff in here
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.440]   No wonder you've been gone the whole
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:28.760]   I know I was walking here. Um, well because the whole book it is I'm just finishing off the last one, but um
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:31.800]   The page count is over a thousand pages
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:36.120]   So, um, I divided it into four books because
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:40.440]   It was it had to be split. Um
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:44.920]   So, you know, it's a thousand pages with lots of diagrams
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.440]   Um, showing all of the theory and the practical
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:55.560]   So, um, it's it's very hard to explain, you know, in a short conversation about the scope of it all
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:59.800]   Right. Um, but i'm glad we've gotten wish held it down to the basics
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:04.920]   Yeah, yeah, I you know, again, I just I want to be sensitive your time almost at the top of the hour
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:09.240]   And I just want to say thank you. I mean, this has been really enlightening
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:14.120]   I am always fascinated. I'm a tinker constantly tinkering with, you know
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:18.840]   Uh, being my own healer. That is my my thing. I am my own healer
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:24.920]   I I loathe out of paths. I can't stand them and I and I do everything myself and that's my passion
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:30.120]   That's why I tinker with so many different things, but but you've introduced this concept
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:35.160]   To me that makes a lot of sense and I just need to process it and I, you know, I've done she conch
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:39.160]   So I understand that aspect. So yeah, thank you so much for sharing that with me and
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.440]   Uh, these are the three books that that Ana has written
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:47.320]   Uh, they're all the return to the garden of Eden the first book one is
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:53.160]   alchemical laboratory, uh, then rising raising christos and then the irish elixir
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:57.320]   Now you're working on the fourth book in the series. So what are you calling that one?
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.440]   And that's called inner compass. Okay, that is basically
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:06.440]   The instructions to all of what i've been talking about. So
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:13.960]   A lot of the stuff that I was talking about at the beginning of our talk, you know, it's got irish maps and this and that and cosmology
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:19.880]   It's all it's all a bit confusing because we did jump around a little a little bit. So um
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:27.400]   The last book is slightly different to the first three the first three are the
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:29.640]   theory
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:33.480]   Um, so for example in alchemical laboratory, that's got
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:39.080]   All of the yin yarn. It's got all of the anatomy of physiology. It's got the
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:45.320]   Daoist theory. It's got the microcosmic orbit. What is it? It's got all of the
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:52.680]   uh, human and meridian system and then how that meridian system relates to electromagnetic torus fields
[01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:57.480]   And then how our body relates to it electromagnetic torus fields and tesla coils
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.800]   So, um, the spine of the human
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:08.520]   Is actually with the brain on top is a tesla as a tesla coil with a ball on top
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:13.640]   So it's kind of showing the electromagnetic body through
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:19.080]   Chinese daoism as a circuitry system so we can
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:22.760]   Get practical with it
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:31.720]   If that makes sense like if we can start imagining that our meridians are electrical circuitry systems flowing water, which contains
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:36.120]   Electricity, right then we can start
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:43.400]   Owning that like take be your own doctor take charge of your own body when you know where things are
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:47.640]   Oh, yeah, yeah, that's the key to everything right
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:53.560]   Uh, okay. All right. So, um, let me just go ahead. I just want to just let everybody know
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:09:02.760]   You know, um that in addition to you being an active in person practitioner in bali and now an author of multiple books
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:08.760]   Uh, just for anyone who's interested. I understand you also do over the phone or or online
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.720]   consultations. Is that correct?
[01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:16.600]   Undoing bio resonance now remotely with, um
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:24.360]   uh technology called genius, which uses the voice and the photograph and the birth date and
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.960]   I guess just use photograph birthdays
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:31.480]   Voice
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:36.440]   No, my mind's gone blank one other thing. Okay, and basically it records the voice pattern
[01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:42.600]   In turns that into a frequency a specific frequency that is like your particular
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.280]   fingerprint
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.280]   Only you have this frequency
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:51.480]   on that particular moment of that day and then that frequency is compared to everything I have in my
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.960]   technology
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:10:00.360]   and then depending on what is coming up through the Chinese medical diagnostic discussion
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:04.680]   we have different areas of your life to
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:08.840]   uh harmonize and I do that harmonic
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:12.200]   uh harmonization through applying frequencies
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:20.200]   Which may be certain acupuncture points and minerals vitamins thoughts emotions back flower remedies
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.480]   I have thousands and thousands of frequencies
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.600]   That's it. Um, I wouldn't help people with my
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.640]   acupuncture Chinese medicine knowledge
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:33.640]   Um giving them these frequencies that get played back as sound plus
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.360]   giving them diet lifestyle
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.160]   advice or you know
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:42.360]   all this other um
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:47.960]   That does come into self-healing because it's not just oh I can use a frequency and everything's going to be better again
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:54.680]   No, you might need to spine aligned by an osteopath or you might need a heavy metal detox or you might need this
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:59.320]   And that or do you just change that part of your diet and you'll have an Ayurvedic
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.160]   um
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.640]   you know dietary stuff going on so
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:09.560]   I like to give people as much information as I can to make changes in their life so they can
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.920]   Use all of it and it will benefit
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:18.200]   That's awesome. So anyone who is interested in contacting Ana
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.960]   Um, the website is uh, an is science witch.com
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.040]   And then you can basically contact her through the contact page here
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:30.840]   So you do distance healing you do on-site healing you do consultations
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.200]   Uh, and you're an author. I don't I don't know when you get a chance to rest
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:37.160]   That's a lot going on
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:41.320]   Uh, but you know, I just want to say thank you so much for spending some time with me today
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:45.560]   I'm really excited. I want to kind of start. You know, luckily for me
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:50.440]   I only have to wait a couple of days, right? And then the the moon will be in areas and I can go ahead and give this a try
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:54.200]   I you know, I really like I really want to try to work on my third eye
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.680]   Um, but yeah, yeah
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.960]   Um, so I've discovered
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:06.680]   Um, because you get very electromagnetically charged and sensitive and you could you definitely become smarter
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.120]   More psychic you'll be able to put dots together more easily
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:14.360]   Even if you're not doing the actual microcosmic orbit
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:20.520]   You will notice that you have this if uh, happening in that uh time window
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:25.080]   But what i've noticed is that you should be very careful about what you put into your consciousness
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:31.400]   So don't watch any creepy movies or anything on like tik tok or
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.360]   You know, the world of the nutcases
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.960]   Um, because that will be basically putting rubbish into your system that you have to clean out
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.640]   um
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:45.080]   So I have noticed that if I expose myself to these kind of
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.880]   uh
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.640]   You know fields of frequencies that are not necessary to my life
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.920]   I do at some point have to get them out of my body because I saw them
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:13:00.760]   Yeah, I get that that's dark energy and I avoid it like the plague, but you can't help but run across it
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.080]   You know, I actually do avoid it, but you can't run across it if you're watching something
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.920]   Um on you know like watching a movie and all of a sudden some kind of
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:13.880]   advertisement for another movie pops up and then all that dark imagery pops into your head, right?
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.760]   And I try to avoid it, but you just can't but you're right
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:21.880]   Uh, once it comes it's a frequency and once that frequency comes into your bio field, you got to get it out of there
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:27.640]   Uh, it's really dark. It's bottom line to me. It's just all dark energy. It's not good for us. I agree
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.720]   Thank you for that tip though
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:35.560]   So yeah, anybody who wants to learn more and there is a ton to learn I I bought all your books
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.240]   I'm working on them
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:42.120]   I mean each one said three other pages. So there's a lot of content, but it's fascinating
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:46.760]   And I've been watching your videos and I'm learning a lot and I just want to say thank you so much for this
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:51.800]   You know taking time to talk with me and about helping me as well as anyone watching
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:56.520]   You know how to raise your chris christ oil how to align yourself with the cosmos?
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:02.760]   Energy and so that you're all you know in alignment and that itself is a healing practice, which is amazing
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.440]   So I you know, I'm glad to learn this. I'm just in a learning mode right now
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.160]   I'm excited and I want to just say thank you. So
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:13.880]   Uh, anyone who wants to reach out to uh, Anna can reach out at her website here
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:18.920]   You can reach me at the tiggers academy and then we also have a uh, telegram chat group
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.240]   uh kind of a new one. It's uh
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:24.920]   Called the health and healing and I've just opened it up on telegram
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:28.760]   Uh, it's it's kind of an old one that I converted and uh, Anna's in there
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:33.160]   I'm in there and a whole bunch of other healers are in there as well. So if you're interested in health and healing
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:40.600]   Uh different telegram chat group more than welcome to come join us ask us questions and uh and chat with the rest of the group
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:45.160]   So there you go. Is there anything else you want to share with us today before we go?
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:49.080]   No, I just want to say I love your your group
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.360]   um
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:52.840]   I've met very very amazing people in your group
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.680]   um
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:55.960]   and
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:01.640]   Yeah, thank you very much for having me on your show because it's what being you said two years since we had a
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.800]   had a talk
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:08.760]   Yeah, that's I know that was amazing. It was you know that that talk by the way if anyone wants to kind of
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:12.680]   See how uh, Anna uses biological
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.760]   Magnetics in her practice
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:18.440]   Uh, that video talks about how to apply
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.080]   Uh the violet ray as well as the lacoskey multi wave oscillator
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:27.720]   Uh in treatment of various, you know issues illnesses injuries and so forth
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:33.240]   So that's that was that two years ago and it seems like from that moment till now, Anna
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:39.240]   You have come so far in terms of just this universal cosmic awareness, you know
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:43.240]   It's just it's amazing how much you're evolving. It's so exciting to talk
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:47.640]   It really is. I mean, it's kind of what you because you disappeared off telegraph for about a year
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:52.120]   And I was wondering where you went and then you pop back up you're like, yeah, I wrote books and I'm like, oh cool
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.960]   And so it's just really great that you reconnected with us and I want to say thank you
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:01.880]   Oh, thank you too. Yeah, I'm glad to be out of the hermit cave because I realized that
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:07.480]   Every time I was in the book and then I went out of the book and and played with my friends
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:11.480]   I got very distracted and I couldn't do it. So I had to kind of limit my
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.200]   My social life
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.160]   So you're hiding in the jungle to finish your book, right?
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:23.160]   Okay, so I'm gonna sign up don't hang up don't hang up yet
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.720]   I'm just gonna go ahead and end the recording now and say thank you to everybody for taking the time to
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:31.160]   To sit with us today. I hope you learned something. I hope this was helpful
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.680]   If you want to get ahold of us, you know where thank you a lot
