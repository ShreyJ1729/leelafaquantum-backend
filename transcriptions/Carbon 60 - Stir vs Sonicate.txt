[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me, Kay Elmer, and in
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.680]   this video I would like to share with you a lot of my research that I've done on
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.400]   the differences between stir and sonicate when it comes to making C-60 oil. So let's
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.000]   start. We've got our disclaimers. This is research purposes only. C-60 oil is not
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.680]   approved by the FDA. You understand that making and consuming C-60 oil is
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.000]   experimental and you do so at your own risk and again I don't endorse products,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.920]   I don't get paid, I don't have any products and this is just purely my own
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.520]   research that I'm sharing and the most important thing obviously is anything I
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.120]   say is should not be considered medical advice. Alright so before I get into it
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.360]   though I would like to say mahalo which is Hawaiian for thank you and we use that
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.360]   word often over here to the C-60 labs and to red line by medicals. Both of these
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.760]   companies actually contributed to this video not monetarily but they gave me
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.400]   some tremendous information that I'm going to share with you to answer some
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.840]   really important questions that you know would just take us you know for those
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.240]   of us who experiment it would take us a long time to figure out. These guys
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.880]   obviously make a lot of product and they've got a lot more opportunity to learn
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.440]   from higher volume of experiments you know that they're doing and they're
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.680]   and both of them were very kind to share information with me that I've included
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.720]   in this video as pro tips so stay tuned for that it's there's some great tips
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.040]   that they've both provided in terms of how to make the best product for a C-60
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.640]   oil. Alright so now now this is all about the
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.440]   difference between stir and sonicate because as you know when you're making
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.880]   C-60 oil depending on the type of C-60 that you're using whether it's
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.640]   powdered or pulverized you have a different process if you've
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.560]   ever watched any of my older videos and so the whole idea I mean if you're
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.480]   just using powdered C-60 you add it to the oil you stir on a
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.680]   magnetic stir you let it sit around for a while you filter it
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.000]   you're good now if you're using pulver I-C-60 you mix
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.600]   the pulver I-C that's what the PC-60 means pulver I-C-60 with oil and you
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.920]   use an ultrasonic machine and you sonicate the oil then you let it settle and you
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.040]   filter and so there's a huge difference here between stir
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.360]   and sonicate and if some of you happen to watch you know other
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.760]   individuals out there making videos about C-60 you will know that the general
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.000]   consensus is that sonication is bad and don't do it
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.480]   and I humbly disagree with that and I will show you the data
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.320]   to prove my point so let's talk about stir and sonicate by
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.600]   starting with stirring now the thing about stirring that you really
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.560]   need to think about and it's you know it's a lot more than
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.680]   than you than I originally thought I just thought you know I first started
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.520]   out I just bought the cheap one on Amazon and started her up you know and I
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.880]   didn't think about all the different things that are involved
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.040]   when it comes to using a magnetic stir so that's what this video is about so
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.680]   I'm just gonna cover this real quick and then we'll jump into the detail but
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.480]   there's definitely a difference okay between a stirrer and a mixer
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.880]   and they come in different configurations whether they're an induction stir or
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.720]   they use an electrical motor the capacity of the stir I mean how much
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.600]   can it handle from a stirring capacity wise how fast does it stir or you know
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.440]   spin around you know it doesn't have a timer or not
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.160]   and then of course temperature is a real big deal because some
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.040]   magnetic stirrers also are a hot plate and so you have the opportunity
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.040]   of you know of you know basically controlling the heat but at the same
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.600]   time electrical motors have been known to
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.120]   get warm as they're used as opposed to induction which doesn't
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.640]   so temperature is is definitely an issue when it comes to magnetic stirs
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.720]   the type of stir bars there's been a lot of conversation in
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.280]   the chat about the types of stir bars and which is the best one and which one
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.120]   would you use for what purpose and and it's quite an interesting subject all
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.280]   by itself and then the stirring mode you know one thing that a lot of
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.760]   folks don't really ever get into is what's direction are you going to spin
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.200]   your solution and then of course the magnetic fields this is a
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.560]   magnetic stirrer so it has a magnetic field
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.400]   and what's the implications of those so let's just jump right into this
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.560]   so now um this is my little setup here at k-oamer labs
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.960]   and i basically own two of the cheaper amazon ones that you get everyone you
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.080]   know a lot of people have these if you watch all the other videos about people
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.160]   making c60 this seems to be the the go-to one it's cheap one it's like 30
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.360]   bucks and then i also have a these are motors right and then i have an
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.240]   induction one right here from argos and i just
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.800]   bought this to to do other experiments on not really knowing what i was buying
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.920]   when i first started but this is my setup i got two motors and one
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.440]   induction um and so now when you know the since this is the one we most
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.200]   people use i do want to just mention that you know the capacity for this
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.960]   this stirrer on the product if you read the product definition
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.480]   on amazon it's 3 000 milliliters so it's supposed to handle
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.440]   three liters okay and it said its speed is from zero to 3 000
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   rpms or rotations per minute okay but one of the things that you know when
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.200]   when you buy this thing and you start using it and you all know i mean hundreds
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.480]   of you use this one and you already know what i'm about to say
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.000]   and what's interesting is if you read the actual product
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.240]   description which is amazing how so few of us do and i'm guilty of that too
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.000]   it actually says right in on amazon in the product description
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.520]   not suitable for highly viscous solutions well
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.360]   what is oil it oil is a highly viscous solution so
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.040]   even though this thing says three thousand the capacity
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.000]   rating is three liters there is no way because i'm going to show you this
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.120]   little video i made um and so the thing about this
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.160]   video you know this is a 500 milliliter flask
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.080]   and you see that vortex on the top as it's spinning
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.400]   that means that all of the oil in the entire flask is spinning
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   but it's only if if i use a 500 milliliter flask oh that's just my
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.640]   little guy when i'm doing some experiments there
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.800]   okay so the point here that i'm making is that if you put a full liter and you
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.280]   know this right you guys do this if you put a full
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.120]   liter of olive oil on one of these puppies you won't see the top of that
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.880]   vortex and if you don't see the top of that vortex that means only the
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.280]   bottom part of the oil is spinning around and up here it's barely moving
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.920]   it's not even moving it's enough for you to notice
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.040]   that there's even a ripple on the top which means you are not
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.920]   getting the whole thing stirring so don't put a whole liter
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.120]   on one of these guys because if you don't see that vortex
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.000]   it's not stirring you're only stirring up this bottom part here
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.840]   so you've got to basically see that vortex right there
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.720]   and then you know that everything in the flask
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.560]   right well right here everything in the flask is moving so
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.120]   like right now i'm doing like this you know
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.480]   i'm doing this this oil right here is like a bunch of leftover oil
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.680]   i had leftover avocado and mct and coconut and
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.240]   or so i just decided to make a liter of just all kinds of oil and then i put
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.200]   them on and i split it between two 500 milliliter flask
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.440]   and they're spinning around and there they go
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.560]   just is running right now and that's basically the point though as i want
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.120]   to make is that it is a highly viscous solution
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.320]   it does not this little guy even though it's rated at three
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.920]   it's only going to handle half and so i've also heard from a couple of
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.520]   folks in the chat and they've said the same thing about other machines
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.040]   so the general rule of thumb and this is just my humble opinion
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.000]   the general rule of thumb is that whatever it says
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.400]   that means it pretty much can only handle one third
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.080]   uh or less of what it says it can handle if not if that
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.880]   and so of course by the way this is the cheapest
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.920]   made in china kind of model you know it is the cheap one
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.040]   and so obviously it's not going to handle much anyway to begin with but if i were
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.480]   to buy like a more professional model like one of these guys
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.000]   and it says 3000 i would assume that it could pretty much handle a liter
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.600]   so i'm going by the one third rule but even then i think if you were to put a
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.800]   three liter uh i don't know though i'm just guessing but i'm thinking if you
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.400]   put a three liters of oil on one of these guys
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.840]   i don't know if you'd see the vortex if you know about that and you and you
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.760]   didn't see that in your own lab please comment below and let us know
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.560]   that you know that you can trust some of these bigger these more expensive
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.640]   professionally made for real you know labs uh types of
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.360]   stirs okay and they can handle that level of capacity
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.560]   so enough about that so now the idea about stirs versus
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.720]   mixers uh and that is the idea that the stir is simply
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   it spins the bar and then inside this solution the actual flask nothing moves
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.160]   okay except the fluid and it's just that little bar spinning there
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.720]   you can see the vortex right there in a spinning way
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.120]   um now some of these magnetic stirs will also come with this temperature probe
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.240]   uh you know if you have a if you have a thermometer on here this can also be a
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.720]   hot plate so but this is the basic setup of a
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.240]   general magnetic stir and of course it comes in different sizes okay so you
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.360]   can go up from you can go one all the way up to i think the
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.280]   biggest one i've seen is like 12 and then you know you can do a lot on one
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.560]   and of course they're very expensive and so this is the basic setup of a
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.800]   magnetic stir and then you've got another device called a vortex mixer
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.040]   and you may have seen this on other videos of other folks
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.560]   i don't own one of these because i do a lot more than just a little tube at a
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.040]   time uh and so but this basically you put the
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.760]   tube down right here and this little black part just
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.680]   you know and and then it stirs the whole so the whole container is moving
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.320]   and it doesn't really quick and it just stirs it up like that
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.360]   but bottom line is that you know there is a difference between
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.320]   mixers and stirs and the topic of conversation here
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.800]   is stirred so uh now temperature this gets really
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.480]   interesting because you know one of the biggest subjects out there is like
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.200]   you know if i get a stir should i get the hot plate
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.520]   and if i don't have a you know and then of course
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.160]   you know and if i do have a hot plate you know how
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.480]   how uh warm should i make the oil now as if you remember from the rat study
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.040]   that i did a video on that they stirred for two weeks
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.360]   at room temperature now room temperature in a lab if you've ever been in a lab
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.520]   you know their air condition they're cool i'm guessing probably like 72
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.000]   you know around their degrees and so that's
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.200]   quote room temperature in the lab that's what they did in the rat study and of
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.600]   course everything we all talk about it's always
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.480]   tied back to that benchmark study but so one of the things so i did i did go
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.680]   out and and look at some of the science literature i did find two studies
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.040]   that talks about temperature uh and whether or not you want to heat up your
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.200]   oil while you're stirring it so now you know by the way if if you don't if
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.000]   you're not familiar with my videos i put almost everything i'm saying
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.520]   uh if there is a link for what i'm talking about and i and i really i
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.080]   like to put the links there so you can read more i'm only going to cover it from
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.760]   high level if you want to dig in go check out the links in the video
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.600]   description there is a links boy on this video there's probably more links
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.720]   that i've ever put in any video so there's a link to this study right here
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.760]   called temperature dependence of the light fullerene solution
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.560]   or sorry solubility and natural oils and animal fats
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.800]   okay what this study did was basically they studied the differences
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.960]   uh in saturation and they they based their saturation
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:19.160]   was basically how many grams per liter using a spectrometer
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.680]   um uh to determine the amount of dissolved fluids
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.440]   or dissolved sediments uh of the 660 specifically
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.480]   in the particular types of oil and so on table three
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.920]   it lists a bunch of different oils and so let's just focus in on olive oil
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.920]   because yes the main go-to oil for that and so what's interesting about this
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:42.120]   study is it showed that using that dissolving c60 and i want
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.080]   to point out that in this study it was only
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:51.880]   60 percent c60 at 99.9 percent purity and 34 percent c70 so they didn't just
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:57.480]   use pure c60 and they only uh put it 10 hours in what they call a shaker
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.000]   uh so they didn't even really kind of use a stir they use a kind of it sounds
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.240]   like they use a uh a mixer of some kind but they they basically you know when
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.520]   we're looking at solubility we're looking at temperature right
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.960]   olive oil and so what's real interesting here that different temperatures here
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.040]   in centigrade and here's i translated them in fahrenheit
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.560]   they were able to reach a 1.2 grams per liter
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.280]   uh of saturation at 176 degrees fahrenheit so
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.560]   okay there's two points here right now okay this
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:32.840]   proves that the hotter it is the higher you're going to get or the
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.320]   more dissolved c60 you're going to get into
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.240]   solution which is the intuitive thing right the intuitive thing is yeah
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.360]   if i heat it up i'm going to be able to stir it in faster it's kind of like
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.760]   if you've ever stirred you know sugar into water it's going to go it's going to
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.840]   dissolve way faster in hot tea than cold tea right
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.080]   and so it's you know this common sense right
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.880]   but so what's interesting though and then so that's that point right that you
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.040]   know heat increases uh does you know does uh does
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.960]   dissolution right now the other thing though i do want to point out is that
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.280]   the kind of like the benchmark saturation in the
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.960]   rat study was 0.8 milligrams per milliliters or 0.8 grams per liter okay
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.960]   0.8 is the benchmark number and so what's interesting here is if you look at
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.120]   104 degrees or 40 degrees centigrade in olive oil they were able to reach
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:30.360]   basically if you round up 0.8 and so this 104 between 68
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.560]   right this this is more like room temperature here if you were to
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.120]   actually consider it uh you know between here and you know like right
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.560]   about here would be room temperature and you can see where they basically got
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:45.400]   0.5 or 0.47 and then they jumped right up to 0.75
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.800]   when they got up to 104 so uh by you know so you can the rat study guys
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.840]   came out around here well they got 0.8 but they did it at room temperatures
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.120]   you know a little bit different but they were using 100 percent C60
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.920]   and they were using stirs not shaker so you know a lot of differences here but
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:06.280]   the idea here and this is the point is that they got as high as 1.2
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:12.840]   they had to go really hot but they got 1.2 grams per liter and so
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.400]   for anyone out there and i have ran into these individuals and comment sections
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.040]   and there's not a lot of folks but boy you know
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:25.000]   you run into people and they're like you know no way C60 can't get more than 0.8
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.560]   you know because that's what the rat studies say well you know guys come on
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.280]   really uh this study here proves you can go higher than
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.280]   1 than 0.8 you can go to 1.2 just with temperature alone
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.760]   so you know it the bottom line is it's you can go higher you can get all the way
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:44.600]   up to 1.2 there actually are C60 products on the market at 1.2 grams per
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.240]   liter in terms of saturation so you know it's a
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.080]   significant point to make that heat will increase saturation
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.440]   and then the other thing too is at 176 you know what does that do the oil
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.440]   we take a look here at smoke point you know extra virgin olive oil the smoke
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:03.240]   points at 350 to 410 and just regular olive oils 390 to 470 so
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.680]   you know it's well below 176 is well well below
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.560]   i mean like halfway even to the smoke point
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.080]   um and so in terms of like will that temperature
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.520]   you know basically destroy your oil just to try to get that high level of
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.400]   saturation the answer is no because you're going to be
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:25.240]   less than half but at calmer labs in my humble opinion
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.240]   there is a taste like crap point and and and all of my experiments that i've
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.440]   done anything over 105 degrees that oil tastes
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.880]   weird when it comes back out and and i don't like it it just tastes
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.200]   burnt and so i i as a rule i do not go for the heat
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.360]   equals better and you know all that stuff i just don't i don't do this
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.000]   but i just wanted to show you that there's a study that proved it
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.720]   you can get the 1.2 and and here you go this is the proof
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.320]   now the other thing the other this is the other side of the coin here okay
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:00.200]   is that this other study called olive oil as a biocompatible solvent for
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.840]   pristine C60 now what's interesting about this
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.200]   study is they used pure C60 they didn't say i mean
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.240]   100 percent C60 but they didn't say what the purity was
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.760]   they stirred for 72 hours and then they used a centrifuge for one to two that's
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.640]   your quote let it settle right and so these guys
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.640]   sort of followed the rat study um you know even though they only went three
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.800]   days instead of two weeks but what they got was and then they measured it in
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.680]   micrograms was they were able to find and this is
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:31.960]   interesting olive oil here based on the temperature was they went
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.920]   backwards and they found that the highest
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.760]   level of solubility of C60 in olive oil
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.520]   was not at 100 you know what it was 176 right here
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.520]   it was not at 176 but it was at 50 degrees fahrenheit or 10 degrees
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.520]   centigrade and they were able to get 5.99 micrograms per milliliters
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.760]   okay now the 0.8 is would be 800 micrograms so
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:00.680]   uh right 8 milliliters versus micro yeah okay it'd be 800
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.400]   so they were able to get 5.99 but what this
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.360]   basically implies is that colder is better
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.840]   but when you look at the actual amount it's not anywhere even close
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:17.720]   to this so in conclusion i really believe
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.320]   that keeping it around you know like under 105
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.080]   is probably going to give you the best saturation and not mess up the taste of
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.400]   your oil there you go so that's temperature
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.920]   and of course you know both of these are in the in the links go ahead and read
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.000]   them if you'd like but you know i'd love to hear your opinion of it
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.160]   but you know when you're looking you know anyway i won't go any more of that
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.320]   but that's just it's just real interesting stuff
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.440]   and i'm a nerd and i love this stuff anyway let's talk about stir bars
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.640]   does size matter or what about shape now i don't know if some of you saw this i
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.760]   was just kind of dinking around one day and i decided hey
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.320]   let me buy a giant bar and see what happens and so
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.680]   this one here on the left is the bar that comes with that little
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.600]   lintella lab this little blue guy that guy you know that bar comes with it
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.120]   and so that's your normal little bar so i decided let's get this monster bar
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.680]   and see what happened and you can you know you can watch this
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.080]   video at your leisure okay and so whoop turn that off
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.640]   and so and then basically i did this little video
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.520]   where basically i tried to use this giant bar
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:17.320]   inside of a one milli one liter flask sitting on my telelab
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.880]   and it was just beyond difficult to kind of keep it steady i couldn't get the
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.240]   dial past like 10 o'clock and so i didn't even though it was bigger
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.400]   it didn't perform better it didn't spin faster because it just kept flying off
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.760]   uh the center of the flask and so that's what this video showed so
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.360]   you know so the idea behind stir bars you know one my first thought on that is
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.400]   you know bigger is not necessarily better it really matters
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.880]   and then what i found out later and this is my point
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.600]   what really matters is the shape okay so now they come uh not only do they come
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.360]   in different shapes like this but the white ones are are actually coated in
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.160]   silicon and then you actually can get out and get
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.000]   pyrex clutter glass coated magnetic bars so there's
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.080]   different you have different choices here
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.320]   on bars you can get different shapes you can have them either silicon or
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.360]   glass coated in my you know again here but bigger
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.960]   is not necessarily better but then one of the folks on the chat was so
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.200]   gracious to share the link to this and the link is in the video description
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.840]   courtesy of the laboratory people they have this chart
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:24.200]   on this page and it's it's awesome because what it shows it tells you exactly
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.640]   every single shape and what's the best application so
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.240]   you know this typical cylindrical bar is what comes with the stir
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.280]   and it's a general purpose bar makes sense right and then there's just more
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.400]   of the kind of like uh uh you kind of like an elliptical
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.320]   one where it's it's kind of like elliptical it's not totally round
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.800]   and that's basically used for cylindrical uh you know uh beakers
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.600]   and then you've got this one with this little nub in the middle and that's
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:53.240]   really good for any type of uh flask or or beaker
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.680]   that's got to like a curvature that's up you know and you've you've seen like
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.800]   yeah mason jars like that right it's kind of curved upwards at the very
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.720]   bottom so you want to use this kind of stir bar for that kind of
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.280]   glassware you want to use that for general purpose
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.840]   of course that that comes with elliptical version
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.480]   and then what's interesting is little round guys are for
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.400]   are for using if you want to do stirring inside of a test tube
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.280]   and on and on and on and so you know what's interesting about this when i read
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.840]   this and was this guy right here this little
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.920]   triangle guy i never even knew they may triangle ones until i read this
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.560]   and this one here is meant for and its best application
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:35.000]   is stirring into solution sediments and that's just like the light bulb went
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.600]   off because you know when i'm stirring um powdered c60 into oil
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.560]   and i'm using this type of bar or this type of bar
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.720]   when i'm done you know i just get this fine black silk all over the bottom
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.920]   the sediment you know because you don't see 60s of powder it's a set of it
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.040]   and then and so because and you know what because these things aren't meant
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:58.040]   this thing right here is meant to keep that sediment up into the solution
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.160]   so that you can dissolve it better so you know my next experiment
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.840]   well i've got a whole list of them but one of my next experiments
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.160]   is going to get one of these guys a triangle one and to see if it actually
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:14.280]   gets if i get a better stir result using a stir bar design for
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.000]   sediment as opposed to a general purpose one so
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.280]   you know when it comes to stir bars and your magnetic stirs
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:24.120]   you know size may not matter but shape definitely matters
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.640]   and there you go oh one last thing i looked this guy up
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.720]   it ain't cheap that little guy right there like 60 bucks for a stir so
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.440]   yeah i'm gonna have to wait till i got some money on that one but it's you
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.400]   know it is interesting and that's the point right shape matters
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.520]   size maybe not um boy you can really go along
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.920]   go a long way with that phrase but i'm just going to jump
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.320]   right into stir mode now magnetic stirs there is a difference
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.000]   different stirs can do different things um and so now this and tell that i'm
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.080]   going to talk about this guy a lot because i own two of these guys
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.960]   anyway this guy right here only goes and spins clockwise right so your little
[00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.640]   bar only going to go clockwise um and so
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:05.400]   now i've got this other guy right here and i bought him so that i could
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.000]   experiment with what would happen if i stirred something in the opposite
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.960]   direction you know and i can't figure out what would
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.680]   happen i just wanted to try it so i got this guy
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.800]   and i've yet to do that experiment because it's on that long list i mentioned
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.760]   but this this one right here well this type of
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.400]   stir is it well this is an induction stir and it can literally go and i could
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.720]   set this thing to go clockwise or i could set this thing to go counterclockwise
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.120]   it's actually in the in my room right now doing counterclockwise stir in a
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.240]   but an experiment okay and of course these are the different prices and so
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.800]   that's what that one does you can get one that does clockwise you can get one
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.600]   that goes either or and then you can get one like this
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.800]   that can go clockwise it can go counterclockwise
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.920]   and it can auto reverse and that's what's super cool
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:54.120]   this is like i'm hoping san is good to me this year because i this is my dream
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.480]   one that i hopefully one day will be able to afford which is
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:02.280]   a magnetic stir that can do all three um and it also has a hot plate so it's
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.280]   like you can do it's it's everything it's all in one these are not cheap
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.600]   but you know this is so cool that you'd be able to
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.440]   to uh to set it at auto reverse because auto reverse means
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.760]   it's programmed automatically and i think this puppy goes up to 90 minutes
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.280]   so you can set it like every 30 minutes every hour whatever uh you know spin
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.320]   clockwise and stop then spin the other way then stop then spin
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.920]   and you know and i and i believe and this is just common sense i guess
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.080]   intuitively i'm thinking if you did that you would probably get the best
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.520]   stir ever because you you're basic you know you're mixing it in both
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.840]   directions um and you're constantly you know it's
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.800]   constantly agitating the sediment and blah blah blah blah
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.240]   so you can imagine that if you had some of the different
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.080]   features as you could really get a lot more creative in terms of
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:51.480]   increasing the saturation of c60 in your oil because
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.840]   you've got a fancy stir that can do a lot more than regular stirs
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.800]   and you've got the best bar for the job you know so these are some of the
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.360]   considerations for the holy grail of c60 oil which is
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:06.520]   try to get as much c60 into that oil because
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.520]   that we don't have to drink so much oil every day so
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:12.840]   anyway there's that so that's stir mode so now let's talk about magnetic fields
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:17.080]   i want to show you something uh about magnetic fields because these are
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.800]   quote magnetic stirs so let me tell you about magnetic fields
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.880]   and i i do need to preface this with something that i haven't mentioned before
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:28.600]   but before i was interested in c60 and still to this day
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:33.080]   my number one hobby interest passion is bio-electrical
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.040]   magnetic and and i've been studying that for well over a decade
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.160]   um and uh it is just something i absolutely love to
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.800]   to learn about it's something i love to read about
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.280]   and practice with and and experiment with and i actually as a hobby
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.720]   i collect bio-electrical magnetic devices and do experiments
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.280]   so i'm kind of a nerd that way but you know it's my thing so anyway so
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.800]   because i'm a i'm a bio-electric magnetic nerd i
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:01.880]   actually own probably every type of device you could use to
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.720]   to measure things so so i did a test here and i want to show you this test now
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:10.600]   with this test i took my magneto my magnometer
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:15.800]   okay which measures a magnetic field this is a real low one it's only going to
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.520]   do 10 goss but anyway what i want to show you
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.200]   though is the differences between my two different brands
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.600]   of magnetic stirs and the type of magnetic field
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.280]   that it creates while it's running so now first let's going to take a look at
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.880]   let's measure the intellilab magnetic stir and i want to show you
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.160]   something here plus means it's a south pole
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.520]   uh energy meaning that's the south you know basically you know
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:44.200]   magnetics have north and south pole so this is south pole energy and you can
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:49.240]   see that the that the meter literally goes past the 10 goss so it's a very
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.000]   strong south pole field being generated
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.880]   by the intellilab as it's running okay so now i take the same magneto
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.520]   magnetometer i'm sorry to the argos spinner that's called the thin spin
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.320]   and let's measure that one now you take a look at this and you can see
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.000]   where right there the you see that little flicker right there
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.840]   that's the induction that's the electrical signal going through the
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.520]   coil right here in this induction spinner and what's happening though is
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.800]   it's going on to the negative side and that's north pole
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.880]   uh magnetic field and so but you also can see another very important thing
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.080]   was that this is a very very light it's it's not even
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:32.680]   going past five goss um on a on a on a north pole magnetic field
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.040]   when i go to measure it so you can see that it never gets past five
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.520]   and it's north pole um field okay and so
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.360]   if you've never thought about this before then you know it's something i'd like
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:48.440]   to just share with you that there is a difference between
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:53.640]   the effects of north pole magnetic fields and south pole magnetic fields
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.880]   and what i just said is extremely controversial in the academic world
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.040]   and i know all of you trained scientists are just
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.800]   pulling your hair right now that i said that but i want to reference the work of
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.640]   Albert Roy Davis who spent 30 years of his life as a
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.400]   scientist studying the effects of magnetic fields
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.720]   on on living beings and you know in mice chickens you name it
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.120]   and and humans and and he wrote numerous different books
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.680]   uh i've read all of them um and the magnetic effect magnetism
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.200]   and its effect on living systems magnet the magnetic blueprint of life are just
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.560]   three i think he wrote about i think eight or nine books
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.480]   and so he wrote all these books and he basically
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.920]   had 30 years of research and then he
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:44.120]   hypothesized um and then went ahead and did the research for 30 years
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:49.080]   to then create a theory that there is a significant difference
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:54.440]   between north pole field and south pole field in terms of how it affects
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:59.400]   um you know any type of organic uh element and then that could be living
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.440]   or like oil oil is still organic hydrocarbon sort of thing
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.280]   and that and set and then his theory uh he basically
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:10.040]   you know i would say proved but uh that's extremely controversial
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.560]   everyone that takes basic physics in college will completely disagree with
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.240]   me and disagree with mr. Davis but basically he says
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.160]   that you know even though uh conventional uh science it thinks that
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.280]   there's a single uh you know single magnetic field here
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.880]   like a big like egg shape thing and there's no dividing line and then
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.560]   they're thus forced uh because there's no dividing line there's there's no
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.400]   difference in in the uh level the what the magnetic field
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.920]   has any effect on anything because there's it doesn't separate but he
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.720]   theorized that there is something that he called
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.840]   the block wall where there's zero magnetism in the between
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.800]   the south and the north and that was his theory okay
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.840]   and i want to share with you this is why why when i talk about
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.080]   measuring okay when i talk about measuring the field and i show
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.720]   with a meter my magnometer that there is definitely a south pole field coming
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.560]   off of this magnetic stir i want to show you what uh mr.
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.880]   davis found in his research so in in the book magnetic blueprint of life
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:11.960]   okay page 41 he's just a little chart here and basically
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.480]   after working for 30 years with all sorts of critters including humans
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.680]   uh this is what he discovered and this is what his experiments show
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.920]   that you know basically the difference between negative or north and positive
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:26.920]   and south pole energy was here that that when it came to
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.080]   and this is a lot of the this i believe this was the clearly the human
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:35.160]   clinical observations were that the the individual's performances when
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:39.320]   exposed to negative improved work capacity improved disposition was
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:43.160]   pleasant reaction time decreased improved equilibrium
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.600]   enhanced metabolism and this is where it gets very interesting
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.360]   the pain was relieved allergic disorders were relieved and healing was
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.080]   enhanced now when these individuals were treated
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.800]   with south pole magnetic fields the performance decreased work capacity
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.400]   was erratic they became depressed uh the reaction time increased
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:07.880]   uh the the erratic uh equilibrium uh irritated their metabolism
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:12.520]   increased pain increased allergic disorders and irritated healing
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.720]   and that's what that's what his experiments 30 years of studying
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:20.280]   um showed these these types of results so it is definitely something when you
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.040]   get into this about okay what's happening when i leave
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.200]   oil sitting on a on a south pole field for two weeks
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:33.400]   and and uh mr davis also approved that this affects
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.080]   water and so i'm going to make a leap of of just
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.440]   assumption here that you know if it affects water and you drink that water
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.560]   you can drink north pole water or south pole water
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:47.720]   and have the same types of effects that the effect of oil would also be the same
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:51.160]   and that is what i'm i'm going to stick my neck out and say so
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:56.440]   when you put oil on a machine that generates a south pole field
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.720]   you are treating it to some negative effects and so
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.560]   with that said one of the things that i do is i try to
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.920]   uh and and this is because i'm i'm really into this stuff which is
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.520]   i neutralize the effects of exposure to south pole energy and i
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.920]   sorry if i never mentioned this before i just didn't want to get too geeky on
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.760]   you guys but but what i do when i'm making my c60 oil it's after i usually
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.960]   until a lab i actually let it when i'm letting it settle you know
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.040]   the whole let it settle for ten days thing i have large bile magnetic
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.960]   bile magnets that have a north pole side
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.680]   facing and the bottom of them are south pole as denoted by the x so i can always
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.560]   remember without having to pull out my machine or my meter
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.920]   so whenever i'm done and i let it settle this is a couple of experiments that are
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.720]   settling right now um it settles on north pole
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.440]   it's so i sit it on a magnet it's in the north pole field
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.120]   and it sits there for practically two weeks and it nullifies any effect of the
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.440]   south pole and it actually changes it back to north
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.080]   okay so that's automatic and that's what i do
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.200]   uh because i i feel it's very important because of the research that i want to
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.360]   make uh neutralize in negative effects of being exposed to south pole
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.400]   so i know you know what i just said to the common person
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:08.680]   um is is just new information so one thing before i leave you on this
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.840]   subject i do want to point out another person
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.400]   and this is a dr william phil pot who wrote the book bile magnetic handbook and he
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.920]   spent a great number of years of his life as a doctor
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.480]   using magnetic fields to treat patients and so you can get his book as well
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.240]   if you want and or you can read from it but this is an excerpt from his book as
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.440]   well and from all of the research that dr phil pot
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:36.280]   phil pot had done when he looked at the effects of from his clinical
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:40.920]   observations uh from the differences of of patients exposed to north pole
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.760]   which is the negative polarity or south pole which is the positive polarity
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.920]   when he found that a north pole it fights infection relieves pain there's that
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.080]   word again it reduces inflammation it encourages restorative sleep it
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:57.320]   increases cellulose oxygen and so forth and so forth and it really
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:02.520]   has a lot of positive effects north pole positive effects right now when he did
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:06.680]   observations in the clinic for south pole treatments uh he found that it
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.280]   accelerates microorganism growth in other words and if you you can read this in
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.120]   albert uh eroy davis' uh material as well
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:18.040]   that he used a different pole on like petri dish cultures and he discovered
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.200]   that bacteria and viruses grow at an accelerated rate when exposed to south
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.880]   pole as opposed to north pole that had retarded their growth rate so
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.400]   i'm sorry i don't mean to go on and on about this is just my passion but anyway
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.360]   it increases pain increases inflammation you can just see
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.120]   it stimulates wakefulness it decreases other oxygen it encourages high acid
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.080]   levels and that's what a south pole magnetic field will do to you
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.400]   and do to your oil and when you drink that oil
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.320]   you know it's part of that but if you if you expose yourself or your oils
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.560]   to north pole energy you get positive and so one other there's well there's
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.880]   two little things i want to add just real quick i want to jump in
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:59.240]   but um if you ever buy a p e m f device which is p e m f
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.880]   pulse electromagnetic frequency device and chiropractors use this all the time
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.520]   you will note that they only ever used north pole
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.320]   on you in fact if you buy one of those paddles
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:16.040]   that's a p e m f paddle it will flat output there will be an end that says
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.080]   this site only and that's the reason why it's
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:23.800]   n only on those types of devices because you only want to subject people
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.480]   to north pole because south pole has a negative effect and then the last thing
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.960]   i want to tell you is that some person
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.880]   on the internet actually uploaded a copy of this specific book right here
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.680]   magnetism and the effects on living systems
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.000]   so if you are interested in what i'm talking about
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.120]   there's a link in the video description below to this book and you can read it
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:46.280]   for free otherwise you'd have to buy it um but you know i'm going to just stop
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.800]   right there because i talked way too much about
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.880]   magnetism sorry sorry sorry let's get back to
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:55.240]   stir versus on okay um okay now here's pro tips pro tips pro tips okay
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:00.040]   this is this is awesome day from c60 labs was so generous to share
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:05.960]   with me so i could share with you his research and this is uh c60 labs
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:12.200]   miracle recipe for how to obtain um a 0.8 milliliters saturation which
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:16.280]   remember that 0.8's the rat study benchmark number
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.320]   okay but now using powdered c60 this is what dave said
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:25.160]   is we're getting full saturation in all our oils at 0.8 milligrams c60 per
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.960]   one milliliter oil where there's no visible c60 residue left on the filters
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.320]   but with extended with but with extended spin times
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:38.360]   of course this depends on the specific oils and the source of his c60 is ses
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:43.080]   insolera so okay now rog i know you're watching this
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:47.160]   this is you know rog and i on the on the chat this is like our holy grail to
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.320]   figure out what's the perfect duration of spin for perfect saturation right
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.840]   so here you go this is the room dave mct there you go
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:59.240]   26 days this is the secret formula it's really hard to get any one of these
[00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.920]   commercial guys to help us do it at home guys because you know they're selling
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.000]   it and they don't want us you know they don't want to
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.360]   compete but you know it's so cool that when one of them will share
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:13.800]   information with us right so here you go to get 0.8 mct 26 days now
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:19.080]   remember now mct does not mean a hundred percent caprylic acid mct it means
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:22.360]   your run of the mill off the shelf mct is usually
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:28.120]   going to be 60 percent caprylic and 40 percent capric okay so that's your
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.920]   your mix but that's what i mean when you know mct can mean all sorts of different
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.280]   things but i'm guessing and this is my guess i didn't ask dave i just
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:37.960]   i just thought about what i'm talking but that you're looking at a 6040
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:43.560]   caprylic versus capric acid mct and that's going to be your 26 days stir
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:50.120]   and then hemp seed takes 23 avocado 16 to 18 days all of 14 days there's that
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.160]   rat study benchmark and then the sunflower takes 14 days
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.600]   so this is your stir times and so i just want to say thank you dave
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.040]   for the pro tip that i could add to this video to help all you guys at home
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:05.240]   make the best c60 oil you can all right let's talk about sonication
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:10.440]   um now if you happen to watch other videos you will know that there's a
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.360]   couple of proponents are just real strong very respectable
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:18.920]   c60 industry folks who have come out uh within the last you know a few months
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.640]   or so and then basically you know when on the subject
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.880]   to sonication they say that it's it's bad don't do it that you know only stir
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.280]   don't don't use uh sonication devices and and you know what and and they
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.560]   quote the reason why and when they say why it's true
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:38.040]   um when you sonicate oil okay it's going to
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:43.320]   produce a extremely high frequency uh wave you know energy wave
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:49.000]   through the fluid and that when it hits uh air bubbles
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.440]   it's going to cause like a micro explosion that into has incredible
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.480]   amount of energy and an intense amount of heat
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:38:00.840]   okay and it basically bursosoxygen um you know like little bubbles of air
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.480]   and it breaks those molecules of air up which is O2 right oxygen O2
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:10.440]   um and hydrogen is usually in there as well uh and so it breaks up the oxygen
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:15.800]   into O1 single atoms of oxygen and you know what a single atom of oxygen
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.400]   will do it will oxidize uh you and it'll
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:24.520]   oxidize your oil and so the answer is yes they are correct
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.160]   those individuals who have stated this are correct
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:30.280]   I took a look at a bunch of papers and these are the names of the papers right
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:34.520]   here and um links to every single one of these go
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.480]   for it if you want to read more and so here's a paper called deterioration
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.960]   of edible oils during food processing by ultrasound
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:44.440]   and the results were different edible oils show significant changes in their
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:48.360]   composition chemical and flavor due to ultrasound there's another one that
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.640]   says ultrasound increases heat and mass transfer
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.800]   disrupts aggregates and can break mackerel molecular chains
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.760]   and here's another one says therefore there's these are the results
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.840]   therefore ultrasound could increase deterioration of food lipids
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.280]   and that's that was liposomes right or you know that we're we're so
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:10.200]   in in love with because that's what we uh we want that's what the whole point
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:13.960]   uh c-60 in oil is creating uh liposomes using food lipids
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.480]   and then this other one oxygen is proposed to be involved since
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:20.520]   purging with nitrogen diminishes any viscosity
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.040]   drop observed and select ion flow tube m s analysis
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:28.280]   uh violates from the oils after sonication indicates
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:32.760]   an increase in the number and quantity of oxidized products
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.880]   so point number one when it comes to sonication
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:44.120]   yes it will oxidize the oil and then oxidation
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:50.120]   increases the uh speed at which the oil will go rancid so
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:55.160]   do you want to oxidize and and make your oil go rancid faster
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:59.320]   obviously you don't so their advice to not use sonication
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.080]   is spot on on that point that's point number one
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.480]   i'd like to share with you point number two other documents here and these are
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.880]   other studies so you can go and read them all you want
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.000]   here's uh effects of ultrasound treatment and zenya essential oil and
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.280]   lipid oxidation of blended vegetable oils here's another one effects of
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:20.040]   ultrasound treatment uv radiation and uh something something essential
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.520]   on oxidative stability on sunflower oil and effects of
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.200]   ultrasonic semen extraction fatty acids on flaxseed oil okay so what were the
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.000]   results okay and you could read these uh these science
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.680]   studies now the results on the first one results showed that ultrasound treatment
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.400]   increased oil oxidation yep we know that that's point
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:42.440]   one point two but eo or i guess that's uh
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:47.080]   extra olive oil can act as i'm sorry no eo meaning essential oil
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:51.960]   sorry eo essential oil right zenya can act as an
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:57.800]   antioxidant and increase oil stability okay this one says this is the
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:02.440]   results indicate that ultrasound and uv could accelerate lipid degradation
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.760]   point one however and the addition of the essential oil as a
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:12.440]   natural antioxidant significantly reduced lipid oxidation and improved
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:16.040]   oil stability so this one proved what this guy proved and then this one here
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.120]   this last one or this third one the chromatalk or chromatic
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.400]   sorry i just can't pronounce that right now showed that there were no
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:28.840]   significant effects on linolenic acid by the ultrasonic assisted extraction
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:32.280]   okay so these are science studies where they're using
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:37.480]   uh sonication devices on oils and the point two that i want to make
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.800]   is that when you add and this is a type of essential oil this is a different
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.320]   type of essential essential oil and what are these essential oils
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.000]   they are antioxidants and what is c60
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:54.440]   it's a antioxidant in fact it's a super antioxidant and if you read the
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:58.360]   rat study one more time yeah they determined that it was 272
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:04.520]   times more powerful than vitamin c as an antioxidant so what happens when you
[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.520]   add an antioxidant to oil that you sonicate
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:12.600]   you get improved oil stability there you go
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.760]   increased oil stability it mitigates the negative effects
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:20.600]   it doesn't eliminate it mitigates the negative effects
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.480]   of sonication on lipids by having an antioxidant present in the solution
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.840]   point number two okay one more point number two
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:33.000]   was here's another uh study effect of sonication of different ultrasound
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.640]   frequency so now let's talk about what the frequencies are
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.800]   does it matter and the results were i forgot to make it italics sorry
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.480]   i'm sorry i'm an OCD it was concluded that extraction of oil
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:47.960]   from sea vulgaris is the type of oil at sonication they tried it at 20
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.000]   40 60 and 80 kilohertz so at different kilohertz does it
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.960]   make it a does it make a difference it had no
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.480]   decorative effect on the structure of the fatty acids
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:00.840]   so depending it didn't you know these four frequencies
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.320]   it didn't make a difference what the frequencies were
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.240]   if you added antioxidants to the oil it improved the oil stability
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:11.640]   and then two that's point two right here's point three that i want to i want to
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:15.880]   share with you and this is just the science uh make your own decision
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.720]   read the study if you want i'll give you my opinion at the end but
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:23.240]   the point three is these two studies right here are these two papers
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.840]   one paper was ultrasonic processing and its use in the food industry or review
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.640]   and the other paper is called the use of ultrasonic and food
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:33.560]   preservation now this is what's coming from the industry this is the food
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:37.160]   industry and if anyone's more anal retentive about the food
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:41.720]   quality and preservation and you name it they got to get it from point a to the
[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.120]   store and they want it to last as long as possible
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.920]   so they can sell it right and so they don't want to throw it away because it
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.720]   expired so this is a big deal when they use
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:54.280]   this in the food industry and so this result here from this paper it says
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:58.280]   ultrasound are sound waves having frequencies beyond the audible range
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.840]   on we know that greater than 20 kilohertz but
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:04.520]   it has a variety of applications with many advantages
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:08.920]   as compared to conventional methodologies used in food industries and what that
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:12.040]   means is if you read this paper they talk about using
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:17.480]   ultrasonic processing to basically kill off all the pathogens uh and
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:22.280]   basically you know uh i guess not necessarily uh
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.360]   what is it um you know clean it up or get rid of all the
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:30.360]   pathogens purified whatever i'm just lost the word for that
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:35.480]   but they use it to to to treat food before they ship it out
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:40.840]   and oils as well so that it comes out it doesn't have any pathogens in it
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:44.040]   and and they're actually looking at this as a very positive
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.880]   new thing for the food industry now this paper right here talks to the
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.320]   results where low power ultrasound is thought to be an attractive non-
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.840]   thermal method due to overcome problems which occur during heat
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.560]   trans treatments such as physical and chemical changes
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:02.680]   nutritional loss and change in organ or organ or
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:07.560]   leptic properties okay now yeah this this one right here
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.520]   uh pasteurization i'm sorry that's the word i was looking for
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:13.800]   in pasteurization they have to get it up to like 107 degrees or something they
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:17.560]   got to make make whatever they're trying to pasteurize
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.680]   they have to heat it up really high to kill off all the pathogens
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:24.360]   but what the paper says is that um you know they sometimes when you heat up
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.720]   something really high you mess up the flavor you mess up the
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:31.320]   the composition of the of the food whatever ingredient you've got in there
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.480]   and so they've been looking for ways to pasteurize without having to
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:40.280]   heat up and you could pasteurize uh food or different edibles and things like
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:44.840]   that in an in a sonication bath right in an ice bath
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.600]   so that it's not going to get heated up but have the same effect
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:52.360]   that in terms of pasteurizing uh the fluid or whatever you're trying to
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.640]   the food right and that's what this this one talks about so that's point number
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:01.720]   three point number three is that they're using it in the food industry
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:06.040]   and so if if anybody that's going to be completely paranoid
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.480]   about sonicating stuff and or i'm sorry about
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.840]   making things go rancid faster it would be these guys but they're using it and
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.880]   they're exploring using it and so point number three is that
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.600]   if the food industry is really looking into using this
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:24.600]   um and if you add antioxidants to it it mitigates the effects
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.560]   then when you look at point number one it's like okay point number one
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:31.080]   taken all right it does that but point number two mitigates that
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.040]   point number three the food protein the food guys are looking into it
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.200]   and then the last thing and i'm not i don't have a slide for it but i just
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.920]   want to say something about low power ultrasound
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:44.760]   and so you know if you've ever been married and you have your
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.040]   wife and you guys going and get your ultrasound what do you think that is
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:52.040]   that's sonication it's very low powered sonication and if you go into the
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.000]   video description i have a paper in there called
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.400]   application of ultrasound in medicine okay and in that paper it basically
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.320]   says that the ultrasound that your wife is exposed to or you
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:06.440]   uh you know when you're having your baby looked at
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:14.360]   is anywhere from three um uh three megahertz to 10 megahertz
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:18.520]   okay so i want to point out that that's really really high
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:21.800]   you know when we're looking at you know when you're looking at using one of
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.760]   these puppies you're looking at anywhere from 20
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:31.000]   kilohertz and the ultrasound that they use on pregnant women
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.840]   is three two ten megahertz so let that sink in point number four
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:39.800]   if it was really really really really bad for you
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.400]   you certainly wouldn't be using it on babies and pregnant women so point
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:47.240]   number four ultrasound on pregnant women
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:51.000]   so now i'm going to leave you with that my humble opinion
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.720]   is that it is absolutely not an issue to use a sonication process to
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:03.160]   uh create liposomes for your c60 oil i think it's very important though
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:07.560]   that it'd be a short period of time at a lower
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:13.800]   frequency and also using a bath versus a probe let me get into that in in a
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.920]   little bit but that's my opinion and we're all you
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.240]   know we all are allowed to have an opinion
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:22.440]   but these are the four points i wanted to make about sonication
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.480]   and you know you guys can make your own decision and have your own humble
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:28.600]   opinions and i would love to hear from you in the comment section
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.520]   okay now so enough about that let's just talk about sonication
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.240]   right so now the concepts here these are just like
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:38.280]   the magnetic stirs a lot of the things you need to think about
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:41.960]   you got probe versus bath the capacity of the machine
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:45.320]   the power of the machine the temperature these things come with heaters and they
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:49.240]   don't just like magnetic stirs and what frequency t is but first before i
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.800]   get into that i really want to talk about some safety tips
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.240]   because with a magnetic stir you're not going to hurt yourself
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.720]   but with one of these you can have problems so
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:02.200]   so these are my lab safety tips about using sonication machines
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:05.800]   you'll hearing protection now if you're going to be in this if you have to be in
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.280]   the same room put something in your ears because it
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.240]   will drive you crazy because of those things just
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:14.840]   yeah this really high-pitched wind to them and it's clearly not good for your
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.680]   brain okay and and then the the when you're using
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.640]   a bath version which is like this big tub here and you
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.520]   fill it full of water and you put your flask in there
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.400]   when you're using that you you you absolutely should
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:33.160]   only use pyrex or borsilic glass which are the lab
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:37.400]   glass okay don't use your kitchen glassware
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:43.800]   because that glass is not may not okay not is but may not
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:49.000]   be sufficient to not break you know like the opera singer in the wine glass
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.720]   thing so only use lab glass which is meant for
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:56.680]   really high temperatures really low temperatures and it meant
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:00.760]   to withstand a lot of you know beady up you know just a lot of pain
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:03.160]   so you can you can definitely put one of these in
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:07.400]   in a in a bath in a sonication bath and i've done it a lot of times
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.880]   no problem at all okay so just don't use regular glass
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:16.760]   and then of course i as i was talking about temperatures i believe in lower
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.640]   that's my opinion again that lower temperatures are better so
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:23.000]   have ice or cold water on hand and that's what i do
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.240]   because i keep it really cold okay and then definitely definitely definitely
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.840]   definitely buy one with a timer if you're going to do it this way or if you
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:33.880]   want to try this out just buy it with a timer
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:37.320]   because there's nothing worse in life than having a machine you got to keep
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.040]   going back to every few minutes to just reset it
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.320]   again like an egg timer is horrible but anyway
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:48.680]   and then do not sonicate oil in the steel basin now if my original
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:53.240]   first time video is about this i didn't know that at the time
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:56.680]   so this is the 29 updated version of
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:01.800]   don't put the oil in the steel basin put water in the steel basin
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:05.640]   put your oil in a flask and put the flask in the water okay
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:09.720]   and the reason is the ultrasonic waves are so intense
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.880]   that it'll literally strip off ions the metal ions
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.000]   off the inside of the basin as it as it as it
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.680]   operates and if your oil is in the basin
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.800]   it'll release those metal ions into your oil
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.680]   and when you taste it it'll taste metallic
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:31.080]   and you certainly do not want stainless steel ions in your body so
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:35.000]   don't just put it in the basin put it in glass put the glass in water okay
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.720]   now make sure the beaker fits yeah you would not believe how stupid some
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.520]   uh sometimes i can be and so that's that's an issue
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:46.920]   and then you know so you know anyway make sure it's right size
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:50.680]   and then do not let the beaker touch the bottom of the basin okay that will
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:53.480]   that's not good you don't want it to touch the sides
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:57.080]   so use the basket that the thing comes with and put it in the basket
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.960]   okay you don't want it to touch the side and the reason is is you could burn out
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.760]   the transducer that's attached to the bottom of the basin
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.880]   by having that much weight sitting directly onto the actual
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:09.160]   um you know bottom of this of the basin okay
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.760]   so don't let it touch the sides or the bottom okay keep it in the basket
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:15.720]   those are my uh calmer safety tips using sonications
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:19.000]   all right let's talk about probe versus bath now these are the different types
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.960]   of devices you could get now there's the uh homogenizers
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:28.280]   and they basically are like probe type devices where the probe
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:31.000]   instead of you putting your glass into water
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.120]   like these guys ultrasonic cleaners where you just fill this thing up full of
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:37.880]   water you put it in or the big ones here like this is 72 liter size you got
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.440]   the big old pipe and it's just water and you put your your flasks in there
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:45.800]   uh these guys actually the opposite they just have the flash but then they put
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.840]   the probe inside now you can get those you can get
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:52.760]   ultrasonic cleaners that have the I mean mixers that have the probes going
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:57.000]   into the into the solution or you can have it where it's a bath so this is
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.320]   probe versus bath and then there's another thing called ultrasonic mixers
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:05.000]   uh which pretty much do the same thing that these guys do it's just a different
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.720]   they just have a different terminology for it but these two
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.640]   are pretty much the you put it inside your solution
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:16.200]   so you've got metal in your oil or you've got your oil in a glass in water
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:21.160]   highly recommend the bath because first of all these things
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:25.320]   are a thousand times more powerful than these things
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:28.760]   because these guys your oil is sitting in a bath of water
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:32.440]   and the machine is passing through all of that water
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:37.640]   and your oil okay as opposed to the energy coming right out of the probe
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:42.600]   directly into your solution and guess what I talked about metal earlier
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:47.640]   okay so I just absolutely don't you know I've seen videos of people
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:51.880]   making CCC oil using it this way and I just I just in my
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:54.760]   humble opinion I don't think that's a good way to do it
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:59.000]   I prefer the bath method I think it's a lot it's much more gentle
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.040]   in terms of you know those micro explosions and things like that
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.840]   using it a bath and you can end the bath you can
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:09.160]   you can really control the temperature with ice and and cold water as opposed
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.480]   to the temperature this thing is going to get really how would you keep this
[00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:14.600]   cold right it'd be very difficult to keep it cold
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:18.600]   so it's easy to keep it cold there's not much it's not as powerful so that
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:23.240]   there's less energy less energy is is a good thing when it's a thousand
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:27.240]   times more powerful so the different devices probe
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.480]   versus bath in my humble opinion bath wins okay now
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:34.600]   let's talk about capacity again powering frequency
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.680]   so for C-60 oil okay again bath not probe just went over that
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:44.280]   capacity measured twice by once okay so now this is the the exact model that
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.440]   I've used you saw this if you did in the how to make C-60 with pulverized
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:53.320]   C-60 oil a video but this is my machine it's a
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:57.160]   dual 20 hertz kilohertz digital heated so it's got a heater and it can go
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:00.520]   up to 40 as you know high frequencies anything over
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.640]   you know well when I talk about frequency let's talk about that
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:07.880]   the frequency range and this is some professional advice from red line
[00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:13.480]   biomedical is it's go from 20 to 28 that's what he recommends
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:18.440]   the sweet spot is 21 hertz but he goes with 28 because
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.640]   you know it's easier he basically gave me some advice of 28
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:25.080]   because it's much easier to buy a 28 kilohertz
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:30.280]   ultrasonic device than it is to buy a 21 one that you can dial to 21
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:35.480]   so anywhere between 20 and 28 is the perfect frequency range for oils
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.440]   so when I use my machine I always set it at 20
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:42.280]   the sweet spot is 21 but there's no machine I can find
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:45.560]   that I can literally set it to that exact frequency
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.680]   okay so but this is his range that he says is okay
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:53.480]   for doing oils and then the other thing too about power is that more power does
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:56.840]   not equal less time so here is a quote from
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:00.120]   an exchange that I had with him but he basically said
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:05.080]   so greater watts and more power does not lead to a shorter
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:09.800]   sonicating time but we use they use okay this is red line we use 400 watts
[00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:13.720]   with 10 transducers however you know however if we used
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:19.080]   1000 watts right much more watts we'd still need to use the same
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:23.960]   sonicating time so you've got pro tip from red line biomedical
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:27.640]   that more power does not equal less time so
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:30.600]   so don't worry about power as much as you should worry about
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:34.440]   keeping the frequency low keeping the temperature low
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:38.040]   okay and using a bath versus a probe all right so
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.920]   so that's something to keep in mind now with this puppy here
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:45.560]   this is a three liter and I found out backwards you know I didn't think about
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:49.000]   it ahead of time that it fits a 500 milliliter flask
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.800]   perfectly it's like made for a 500 meter flask so three liters equals 500
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.600]   that's kind of your starting point if you ever decide to go buy one
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.480]   but again you know measure twice buy one so whatever
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:03.240]   you know glassware you're gonna put you plan to put in a machine
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:07.720]   make sure that you get the specs on on the inside compartment how high the
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:11.160]   water goes up so that it will fit so that you don't buy one that you know
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:14.440]   your glassware doesn't fit like I did once okay
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:17.960]   so these are the main points bath capacity power
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:21.400]   temperature and frequency all right so that's that now I want to share with you
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.680]   some pro tips and the reason I'm sharing pro tips with
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:28.600]   red lion is because red lion is one of the more
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:32.760]   you know commercial it's not one of the more but one more
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:36.120]   I was gonna say famous but not famous but I guess
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:43.720]   what's the word for it reputable providers of C60 oil and C60 products
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:48.680]   on the market and and you know just most people have nothing but just
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:51.960]   great things to say about the folks there at red lion
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:56.120]   I really like them myself there's another vendor out there that does
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:58:00.440]   sonication so it's not just red lion using sonication there's more than one
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:04.200]   and most most I have to admit that most I would say like you know mean
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:09.080]   the high percentages like 80% actually stir versus sonicate
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:12.040]   but there are a couple of commercial vendors that do sonicate
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:16.440]   and their products are you know are very well respected okay so
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:20.360]   I'm quoting red lion here because I see them as an expert
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:25.480]   in the field of making C60 oil especially in making C60 oil
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:29.960]   using sonication so we got a pro tip here and this is our second
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:33.960]   and this is probably the most valuable pro tip he could have ever given us
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:38.120]   because I never knew if you knew if you saw that video
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:41.560]   that I made about how to use his product to make C60 oil
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:45.240]   at the time he didn't want to share he was a secret sauce and I respect that
[00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:48.760]   but I asked him again if he would if he would mind sharing that and he
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:52.920]   actually did and thank you so much for sharing this information
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:58.520]   and again like I said about C60 labs you know it is very rare for a commercial
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:02.600]   maker to share their knowledge and their secrets with with us do it at
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:06.680]   home guys but and Martin was very kind enough to do so
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:09.560]   thank you and so this is what he shared
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:15.240]   now he said how to make red lion C60 using pulver iC60
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:20.520]   was you mix the piece the pc60 with oil and you do it
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:24.360]   gently by hand like like you're like you're folding in a meringue okay
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:27.800]   um and so you don't want to you know just be really gentle and you just
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:31.240]   stir it up and then sonicate it immediately
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:35.240]   and in this specific example he was talking about a
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:41.640]   28 kilohertz sonication device okay and he mentioned 28 specifically because
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:46.680]   he said it was a lot easier to find a 28 than it was to ever find a 21
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:50.120]   but he said if you can get a 21 or you know get one that can you dial down
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:54.280]   the 21 that's perfect but if you can't 28 is fine
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:58.440]   and you know and also I got a 20 so you know those are 20 or 28
[00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.880]   but he's this at this specific description was
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.960]   at 28 hertz so the thing was is once you stir it in by hand gently and you
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:08.440]   don't do it for very long you just get a good you know get
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:12.520]   a good mix then you want to sonicate it immediately
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:18.200]   and here's the secret sauce it is and this is his words approximately
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:25.320]   no more no less approximately 279 seconds per liter
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:31.320]   all right that is a very secret number that he was generous to share with us
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.760]   so that's only like four minutes and something seconds okay per
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:38.360]   liter and it's and he basically was very adamant
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:44.040]   no more no less don't mess with it just 279 cents
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:49.960]   i'm sorry 279 seconds per liter okay and that's as long as as much as you
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.760]   sonicate and and he said room temperature all right
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.720]   and then then you just cover it up and then you mix it occasionally by hand
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:02.040]   very gently for one week and then just leave it alone
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:07.960]   for two now that's and basically that's a minimum three weeks total
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.720]   but then he also said that four to five weeks is better
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:15.880]   so if you really really wanted to do it i guess i forgot an S there
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:20.280]   if you really really wanted to you know seek perfection and make a
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:23.640]   commercial quality product then this is how you're going to do it
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:27.240]   and you'll let it just go for five weeks you know go the whole distance
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:30.680]   just leave it alone and he was so adamant about leaving alone just
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.720]   don't mess with it don't use magnetic stirs don't you know just
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.840]   just little just stir it up girl just it's gentle
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.040]   and you know what was it just it just it just killed me
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.320]   when i read this and we were talking to each other like oh my gosh i've been
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:46.520]   i've been beating the crap out of my oils i've been like stirring for two
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.040]   weeks and doing all sorts of stuff with pulverized
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:53.320]   and i never thought about going the other direction in doing less but
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.560]   but that's the secret sauce guys once you let it sit there
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:02.040]   for those you know three to five weeks and then he says he filters
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:08.040]   using a 0.5 micron bag filter so he doesn't even use vacuum filters
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:12.600]   he uses a bag filter he just let it gravity and then boom he just
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:17.400]   and then he said this is not on the slide but after you filter he just bottles it
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.320]   up and he leaves it sit for three weeks before he ever
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:25.560]   you know sells it so that's courtesy of red lion the pro tip
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.680]   on how to use a sonication device to make
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:33.560]   red lion see 60 oil uh in perfectly and you know one of the cool things about
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:39.080]   red lion is that it comes out red not brown so when you and you all know
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:43.400]   this you makes olive oil see 60 it comes out brown with a red tinge
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:48.200]   this comes out red it is that pure so there you go
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.360]   on there's your secret sauce pro tip from red lion and that concludes this video
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:56.120]   stir versus sonicate everything i've collected in my brain
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.960]   since last year or more than that since i've been doing it so
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.400]   you know if you've made it this far in the video
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:07.480]   good job thank you so much for spending time with me
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.000]   and to listen to this video and i hope you learned something i hope them
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   information i have is valuable to you and that it helps you
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.200]   because that's all i do this for i only do it for one purpose

[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.160]   if you know i do we do have a telegram c60 chat group for
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.160]   anybody who has any kind of question about anything there's all 400 members
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.480]   now there's any they'll just answer any question you have
