[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and in this video, let's talk about
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.000]   biohacking body odor
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.200]   Now I know what you're thinking
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.880]   That's a very odd topic. Why would we even cover that in a video? What's there to learn? Well, you know what?
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.040]   This is why you should care
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.080]   Did you know that your sense of smell is a superpower?
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.280]   Yeah, you know when I was doing some research on this and it all started with
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.160]   Science paper I read and I'll get into that in a little while about no, no, no, no
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.120]   That's how you pronounce it smell, which is this smell of old people and scientists found out that's actually a real thing
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.120]   so anyway, I
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.680]   Discovered that you know I discovered hey, you know, I'm a biohacker
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.360]   I'm a tinker. I I'm aging and the last thing I want to smell is let that smell
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.320]   You know which nobody likes and grandma grandpa and nursing homes
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.480]   And it's just this stanky smell and and I'm just like oh my god
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.560]   It's I've got the major ick from it and I didn't want to smell like that. So hey
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.560]   I did some research and I'm sharing it with you
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.400]   But you know one of the interesting things I discovered was that our sense of smell is literally a superpower
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.360]   And what I mean by that is when you take a look at the five physical senses
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.640]   You know vision hearing smell tastes that right and you look at each one of these things and you know
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.800]   The science is pretty clear on it, you know the vision the light spectrum is huge
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.120]   But humans can only detect light in a very narrow band of the light spectrum
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.400]   Same thing with hearing hearing that you know that the sound you know frequencies zero to good
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.240]   You know cajillion hertz of sound and human hearing is only a little tiny band
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.320]   Of of the different frequencies that we can literally pick up in here
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.120]   And even as we get older we have that band narrows and we can hear less and less frequencies around us and sounds
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.760]   You know so we have a very narrow perception
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.760]   This is my point of
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.040]   What we can hear and what we can see and in you know
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.360]   Are the way we taste and touch and all of these things start to fade and things like that
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.720]   But it's limited
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.520]   But what's interesting is that your sense of smell is not
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.640]   In fact, it is your super power
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.800]   And one of the things about conventional knowledge is that you know and for the longest time
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.440]   You know the the science community thought that we couldn't really smell more than
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.960]   10 000 different odors
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.640]   But what was interesting is that Ruger's university did a study in 2017 called the human sense of smell
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.400]   It's stronger than we think
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.000]   And what they came out with is that humans can discriminate
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.200]   Maybe one trillion different odors
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.000]   Right which is far more than claimed by the folk wisdom in poorly sourced introductory psychology textbooks
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And then cis and this study insists
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.480]   from their from their
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.840]   Results that the human beings can smell up to a trillion if not more
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.800]   They they you know they ran out of numbers to be able to calculate
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.920]   How many different odors a human being can pick up
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.200]   And why am I telling you this on a on a video about biohacking body odor
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.840]   Well, this is my point is
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.600]   For whatever reason, you know, whether you subscribe to intelligent design or simulation theory
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.400]   Or you're just an agnostic or whatever
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.840]   But there's some reason that our physical bodies
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.960]   We're given this superpower and it's a superpower of smell
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.080]   Which implies to me and i'm just making an assumption here that odors
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.280]   Play a significant role
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.800]   in our world in our lives and you know when you look at
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.720]   The concept of biohacking and you know and biohacking simply means somebody who's very much
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.680]   attuned right to health healing longevity and physical performance cognitive performance
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.160]   Athletic performance, but you know these are biohackers typically are your health in oriented individuals
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.560]   Who are really taking it seriously much more than you know the normies around us, right?
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.160]   And for someone who's that much interested in the health and the interesting thing was if you go on youtube
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.440]   No one's done a video about biohacking body odor
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.640]   I mean I did find one that dave aspry he did a short on it and he just talked about what you eat
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.680]   But that's such a superficial level
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.000]   Of information regarding like hey really what is body odor?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.040]   How important is it to our health and you know and just an overall performance and our healing and all of that
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.800]   And and so that's kind of what I just I started going down this rabbit hole
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.880]   And so this is kind of where I I wanted to share it with you first things first
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.840]   I just want to point out that showering and using deodorant is just masking
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.120]   You're not really dealing with the actual cause of the body odor
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.960]   Right, which is driven by three key factors
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.480]   And if you really want to work on that and that is in factor of your health, you know
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.360]   You can't I mean this is my opinion. I don't think any one of us who is health conscious
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.880]   can really discount the concept of
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.920]   Body odor if you don't take that into wanting and to account as to one of your things
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.160]   That's on your list of things to worry about and you know, that's not not that's say worry about
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.320]   But focus on I guess is a better phrase
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.360]   But you know biohackers are talking about a phytophagy
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:27.320]   And sentilinics and they're looking at you know saunas and you know hyperbaric oxygen chambers and all this stuff
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.640]   That we do right, but nobody talks about body odor. So that's what this video is all about
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:39.320]   So first things first what causes body odor way beyond the the superficial aspect of what we eat
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.680]   And you know according to the american society of microbiology in an article or actually a paper
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.880]   They wrote published in december 30, 2021 called
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.520]   Microbial origins of body odor. Well, it kind of came down
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.720]   You know in that article they came down to two specific things from a microbiology
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.400]   You know the sciences the scientists that study this stuff and they really identified the source of smell
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.640]   That are emanating from our bodies is coming from key bacteria
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.240]   And key volatile fatty acids and so, you know, just to give you an example from the article
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.480]   It's quite a lengthy article kind of summarized right here
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.760]   But you know if you've got smelly feet, which is what they consider
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.720]   They called it the cheesy smelling odor, you know, that's called by staphylococcus
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.320]   And it's it's a bacteria called staphylococcus epidermis
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:34.840]   And then what that bacteria does is it degrades the loosen in your sweat to create an isovalleric acid
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.400]   You know, and that's just how they talk, right?
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.920]   But you think about that, you know, it's just right off the bat
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.600]   You know when you look at fish-like body odor is created by that bacteria musty body odor
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.920]   You know if you have a musty odor you have this bacteria living on your skin
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.400]   And there's actually a bacteria that causes people to smell like boiled cabbage
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.120]   But the idea here though is and you hear this a lot and you know in in biohacking
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.640]   You know the whole mine gut connection, right the importance of your healthy gut microbiome
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:11.000]   There's entire conferences that all they talk about is a healthy gut microbiome
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.040]   Well, where are the people who are talking about a healthy
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.040]   Skin microbiome, and that's what we're talking about here. It's like you literally have
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:26.920]   Up to and last paper I read was we have up to three to six pounds
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.120]   Of bacteria that live with us
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:37.880]   Every one of us every adult human being has up to three to six pounds of our body weight is consists of these
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:44.680]   Little tiny creatures that live with us and on us as symbiotic relationships that we have with these these critters
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.040]   And they're part of our overall, you know, we are in an environment
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:56.440]   We're not just you know a person. We are an environment a symbiotic organism that has all this stuff growing on us and in us
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:02.280]   Living with us and we have this symbiotic relationship. That's you know, that's been developed over eons
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.400]   So the idea here that i'm trying to convey is that there is a very critical role
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.200]   Of bacteria as it relates to body odor and how important it is
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:19.320]   That you focus or have a focus on your skin microbiome, and there's also an oral microbiome
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.320]   What's going on in your mouth? And of course, as I mentioned, you know
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:30.120]   The key one that everyone focuses on as your gut microbiome, but this video we're talking about your skin microbiome
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.880]   So if you've got some cheesy smelling feet or you know someone who has
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.240]   You know, they've got an issue with a bacteria
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.880]   That's living, you know, their microbiome on their skin has this bacteria
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:49.960]   Now the other thing too about the key volatile fatty acids where you know the the folks that
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:55.720]   Wrote the paper discovered that hey, you know, there's a if it's a goat like odor
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.920]   And I I personally have never ever lived with a goat. I'm not sure what goat smell like
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:07.480]   I live with dogs and they have their own little smell and you know the puppy smell different than the adults and all that
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:14.280]   But there's a goat like odor that's caused by a fatty acid called three methyl two hexonic acid
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:22.760]   3m 2h, you know, and then there's a cumin like odor caused by another fatty acid and then rotten onions or rotten meat is
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.840]   Actually a fatty acid called three methyl three sulfal hexane
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.600]   One all I guess that's how you pronounce it
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.800]   But then this one I mentioned earlier this old people smell it's also known as nursing home smell
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:43.000]   That's actually been isolated down to an unsaturated aldehyde and it's pronounced or it's a it's a fatty acid called two normal
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.200]   Two known and all that's how you pronounce it. And so that is the origin
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:53.160]   Of smells that coming off of us are bacteria and also
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.040]   Uh from fatty acids and so now that we've identified. Hey, what's causing
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:05.480]   Our body odor and then of course the severity of the body odor because we all have different ranges of body odor
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:11.480]   And how do you biohack that? How do you go? Wait a minute? I you know, I need to take better care of my skin microbiome
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.200]   And these fatty acids like what's the deal with that?
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.600]   I you know, obviously I don't want to smell like rotten onions
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:22.120]   And so how do I deal with these fatty acids that are causing these odors coming off of me
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.760]   As opposed to just trying to mask it all the time
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.600]   And so there's this other point though before I jump into the how-to part
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.160]   Which is body odor and diseases and this is I think the most important part
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:40.760]   About biohacking for health as it relates to body odor is that you know, you could literally have a disease
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.680]   Either it's identified i.e. Diagnose or not diagnosed
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.160]   But what's interesting is that up to per the cleveland clinic they wrote a paper
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:57.160]   About body odor and diseases where they identified that several medical conditions and diseases are associated with changes in a person's
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:04.360]   Usual body scent so you're not only could your body odor be driven by you know, let's say what you eat
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.200]   Obviously if you've ever been around a bunch of koreans, you know what i'm talking about
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:13.000]   Nothing about you koreans. I love you guys, but you're all small and garlic anyway
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.160]   So but the idea here is that yeah, you know, you've got you've got your skin microbiome
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.960]   You've got you know, these fatty acids that are causing odors
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.800]   You know, and then you've also could could possibly have
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.840]   A condition that's putting out an odor and now the cleveland clinic was able to identify
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:34.680]   Very specific odors that are able that are that are diseases that cause specific odors
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.400]   And that it includes diabetes and gout if you're going through menopause
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:49.080]   Overactive thyroid liver disease kidney disease infectious diseases and and Parkinson's are able to be identified by a particular odor
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:55.080]   And so that's how important, you know, if you're going to biohack odors and you might need to think about hey, you know
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:00.360]   What if i'm working on odors and and i might have you know, and you might have one of these types of things
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:05.240]   And that's putting out another different odor and so fixing that problem obviously resolves the odor
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:09.240]   But the interesting part here is that there's the concept of how do you detect all of that?
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.640]   And so this is where it comes up in the whole field of medical detection dogs
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.560]   Now there's this entire you know field of you know of people
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:23.960]   In scientists that are working with dogs and they've trained them to identify all of these different types of of diseases
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.880]   And they're using for diet they're using them from diagnostics, but here's the thing
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.720]   You know, I read several articles on medical detection dogs
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.480]   It is it's a real thing if they people are they're trained to do these things
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:41.320]   And the problem is is that it competes with all the money that big pharma makes with all the diagnostic testing
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.520]   You know instead of just bringing in a dog and sniffing the patient and then the dog will tell you hey, you know
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.080]   What this this person has that's how I guess that's how it works
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.320]   But you know the whole idea though is that you know, so there's a medical community
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.920]   Of of you know what I call awaken alipas that are out there looking for what's actually
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.840]   Working best and don't subject your patients all of these tests
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:07.400]   You know and then of course in all the money that these things cost but just having a dog
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.920]   You know, so there's a group of people that you know do group of doctors alipas
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.960]   I want to use these dogs and of course there's the medical establishment that says, you know, no, that's just you know
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.720]   That's crazy. So, you know, so it's kind of it's a fringe kind of thing
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.800]   But right now there really are such a thing as medical detection dogs and there really are doctors out there
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.760]   Using it, but what's more interesting and of course we all know dogs have a sense of smell
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.200]   That's way greater than humans and humans as you know, it's your superpower
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.160]   But what's interesting is that there's actually a can a hereditary condition
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.680]   That humans could have and this is the amazing story of a lady named joy mill nay
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.560]   Who lives in perth scotland and this lady's you know, short story is, you know
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.600]   She's just a regular lady. She's a retired nurse and then one day, you know her her older husband and her
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.840]   You know, she started smelling something and if you know, you know, you know, you know women
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.080]   If they have this weird smell in their house, they're gonna track it down like Sherlock Holmes
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:07.640]   And then she just went through every possible thing trying to find out what the hell that smell was and she finally narrowed it down to
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.240]   Her husband
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.920]   And then she just tried to you know, basically harass the hell out of this poor old guy
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:19.000]   You know, I need to smell and you have this weird smell and she finally harassed him enough to drag his ass to the hospital
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.840]   And and it was what they discovered was after some testing that they did on this guy
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:31.400]   Trying to figure out what the smell was because she kept insisting that he had this weird smell that he didn't have in their entire marriage prior
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:37.080]   And that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's and so now what was interesting is that the
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.760]   University of I think the University of Edinburgh
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:48.520]   In Scotland got wind of this lady and and this issue with her husband and they decided to test miss missus malen
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:54.600]   And they discovered that she had something called hereditary hyperosima and what that
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:01.080]   That particular genetic, um, you know, uh, I guess abnormality. We'll call it. I'll call it a gift
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.520]   You know, was she has the ability to sniff it out
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.560]   And so they tested her they tested her with you know, this basically ran different experiments on her
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.200]   With people who were you know, they took the they had people who with and without Parkinson's
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.600]   They wore a t-shirt for a whole day then they gave them they gave her the t-shirts to smell
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.840]   And she identified 100 percent of the time with absolute accuracy
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:28.120]   The people's t-shirts who had Parkinson's and the ones who didn't she could say yes or no
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:33.960]   And she actually identified somebody who didn't have it and she said yeah, he's got it and they retested him and he had it
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.120]   And so this is an actual real thing people and dogs
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:43.880]   Or certain people have the ability to smell the odors coming off of diseases
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:49.720]   Which is the key issue here about body odors that it could be driven by disease as well
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:54.280]   And that's something to be really, you know, really aware of so in the in the world of like hate
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:16:01.720]   So how do you bio hack body odor? Okay? Well, first thing is you got to overcome your programming and what I mean by that
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.840]   Simply is that, you know when I took a look at
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.640]   All of the material about body odor, you know over arching, you know
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:16.760]   Message was everybody is so I mean are especially in the western world right now. I live in the western world myself
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:23.960]   You know, we're just so programmed to think that body odor is just this horrible, you know, social
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:31.080]   You know, you know problem and you know or issue and people who smell are like gross and you know, and it's just like, you know
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.200]   Hey, but you know what a hundred years ago. Nobody even cared about that
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:41.560]   So what is that issue here about programming? And so, you know, it's interesting, you know, the national geographic wrote an article called why did
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:47.720]   Body odor start grossing us out. They've you know, and actually just this article came out in the national geographic
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.920]   Just you know, june of 2020 for just this year
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.280]   And the thing that you know, they did their research and they wrote this article
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:59.800]   It's you know, it's the national geographic and they basically concluded hey back in the 18th and 19th century
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.720]   You know bay, you know, bathing became more common back then prior to that
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.600]   It just wasn't a thing except for maybe the asians, right?
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:15.560]   And basically, you know, it started to you know, this this change in social behavior started forging a new association between body odor and negative things
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:22.040]   Like poverty and disease as more as the more educated people in the upper class began to wash
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.920]   They became aware that the working classes and their servants smelled
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:33.800]   So what really happened back then and this is what's programmed all of us since then is that bathing and body
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.840]   Care became a way for the elite to reinforce their status
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.160]   It became bourgeois to smell nice and so or to be clean
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.760]   You know, and we're actually not be clean to not have body odor
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:53.640]   And so if you were bourgeois, right and somebody had a any any little whiff of a body odor
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.600]   They were considered low class and so everybody in the low class didn't want to be low class
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.640]   And so they took on this mindset that oh to smell
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.320]   Is bad and I don't want to be low class
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:12.120]   I want to smell like high class and that's kind of that programming that we've all kind of suffered from ever since then and of course
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.400]   You know, you've got
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:19.160]   Entrepreneurs and profiteers and they're going to just capitalize in on this this social, you know
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:25.880]   Thing the social structure about body odor, but my point here is to overcome your programming
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.840]   There is nothing wrong
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:34.360]   And you are not low class. I am not low class none of us are low class
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.960]   And we're not the bourgeois, you know aristocrats
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.600]   Just because we smell like a human being and that's the point
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.320]   We all smell we are human beings and we will smell like human beings
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   Just like my dog smells like a dog
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:54.680]   There's nothing wrong with that and we've been programmed to think that there is something wrong with that
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.040]   And that's where it leads to the next bullet is we mask it
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.120]   That's what we've been trained by all the commercials and all the marketing
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.080]   And even you know and everybody around us is like, you know
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:10.120]   Oh, you have to put on deodorant you have to put on clones and perfumes and all this crap
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:15.480]   And we've been masking our own natural smell. That's what i natural
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:21.240]   And there's and that we shouldn't we need to stop a stop thinking that it's not natural
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.920]   Stop thinking that it's a bad thing because it just is a thing
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:30.520]   And more importantly, we need to stop masking and there's a huge reason why get to that in a second
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:37.720]   But I think that when we take an actual look and say well, you know, it's about severity right? We we all have a natural smell
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:43.160]   Okay, but if you have something that goes beyond natural smell like it's really offensive
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.480]   To yourself, then you know, then you need to start looking at how do I hack that?
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:54.040]   How do I bio hack my body odor if it's if it's a little more, you know, if it's more than just you know, quote
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:20:00.360]   My normal human smell, you know, and you know, let's let's talk about what that means definition wise
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:08.040]   But the idea of those hey, you know, if you want to bio hack your body odor beyond just what you would consider nominal
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.560]   Stank, you know, then hey, we need to look at the skin microbiome
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:17.880]   We need to look at our toxic load and we need to look at reducing our oxidative stress and here's why
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.360]   So let's just start off with this
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.480]   Now we go back to that article micro micro
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.640]   Microbial or origins of body odor by the american society of microbiology
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:35.400]   To uh, december 2021 now in that article there's a section called deodorizing body odor
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.840]   So when we talk about masking, this is the problem with masking and this is why I
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:47.080]   I don't and i'm going to come in and just go public. I don't use deodorants clones nothing
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:52.760]   I don't put anything on my skin. I just wash soap and water. Okay, because what they were saying
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:21:02.840]   Uh, the american society of microbiology is that deodorants contain chemicals that kill skin flora and block production of stinky byproducts
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.560]   Okay, so in other words, they kill off all the bacteria, but just like your gut microbiome
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:13.720]   You've got friendly bacteria and you've got very unfriendly bacteria and so this is like taking antibiotics
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:21.080]   Right and it's so if you know anything about your gut microbiome if you destroy your gut microbiome with antibiotics
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.800]   You're killing your good bacteria your friends and you're killing your enemies and you don't want to be killing your friends
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:31.560]   Okay, so the idea here is that antiperspirants reduce the amount of sweat clogged by clogging and that's what they do
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:38.040]   But you know what you don't want to clog your sweat clants that your body's natural way to detox
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.720]   And then also many contain aluminum chloride
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:47.560]   Which it creates a gel-like substance that forms a plug at your sweat ducts and your skin
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:54.440]   Now many deodorants and antiperspirants also contain micro my antimicrobials like pop propylene glycol
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:02.040]   I'm sorry triclosan and benza colin. I'm sorry benzo conium chloride
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:08.600]   Which decreases the bacterial abundance and result in an altered skin microbiome in the armpits
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.320]   So what are these? These are some pretty harsh
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.520]   Chemicals that you're putting on your skin. You're plugging up your lymphatic systems
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:22.840]   You're blocking your ability your body's ability to detox and that is simply not good
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:27.640]   You know, so it's like that's why I'm anti-deodorant anti-antiperspirant
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.400]   Just because I don't want to do that to my skin
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.520]   I want to work with my my skin microbiome just like I work with my gut microbiome
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:44.680]   I want to help my friendlies flourish and I want to do everything I can to kind of you know help my body be as natural and healthy as possible
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.800]   But what's interesting is that they also went on to say in the article
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:55.160]   That while deodorants and antiperspirants do the minimum job of reducing bacterial load and their byproducts
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:01.720]   Respectively a growing body of work is focusing on the use of probiotics and artificial micro
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.240]   Microbial communities to reduce malador. So
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.480]   That's pretty interesting. So is there such a thing as a probiotic?
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:15.640]   Just like you would take for your gut, but is there one for your skin microbiome answers? Yes, of course because that's in
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.200]   Doing the video. Hey, you know what? Did you know that there was a scientist?
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.280]   And he didn't shower for 15 years
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:30.440]   To prove his point and and by the way, that's serious serious dedication to your work
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:37.480]   And this guy's name is David will with clock woodlock. Sorry. He's a chemical engineer living in Cambridge, Massachusetts
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:43.480]   He actually went on to form a chemical or like a pharmaceutical company called aobiol
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:47.880]   Okay, and the and the product line is called mother dirt. Sorry mother dirt
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:54.680]   Now David woodlock woodlock as a chemical engineer, you know, basically it was just
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:58.840]   Whatever reason he just really became interested
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:07.080]   in in, you know, microbiome friendly and probiotic products for skin because he got his inspiration
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.040]   You know watching horses roll in dirt as that's their way of bathing
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.840]   Okay, so now woodlock hope that he would natural that he would be able to naturally replicate
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:22.360]   the animals way of bathing and and maintaining their healthy skin, you know
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:29.560]   They're for whatever, you know by using the same concept of using the bacteria in the soil that horses do and you know
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.640]   Chinchilla's also do the same
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:37.720]   And several animals will also do the same. They'll rub themselves in the dirt. My dogs rub themselves in the dirt all the time
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:44.120]   And so that really interested him as a concept for how they maintain their skin microbiome
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.360]   And could that apply to humans? So what he did was he actually went out and harvested
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:54.040]   Bacteria from the soil at local farms and fed them with ammonia and minerals
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:59.960]   And he just started cultivating different cultures of bacteria from the soil that the animals were using
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.440]   And then he would then turn those
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.400]   Then when they turn the ammonia into nitrates
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.560]   Then he knew he had what he wanted and he started narrowing them down to a single strain
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.360]   You know, so after lots of experimenting trying to find the right bacterial strain
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.600]   That seemed the happiest on human skin that was you know that worked really well for human skin
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.040]   And after so then he discovered this thing he called it ao mist
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:29.240]   It's a bacterial strain and after he applied the bacteria on himself that he had cultured the same stuff that the horses were using
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:37.480]   He stopped smelling. So as an ex as an experiment, he kept that up for 15 years
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:42.440]   He did not take a shower and all he would do is he was just replenish
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.680]   The healthy bacteria onto his skin and that healthy bacteria
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.280]   Basically, and in his you know, this is his testimony
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:56.600]   He stopped smelling okay, and it just took care of his body odor because he was working with his natural
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:04.040]   Skin microbiome using a probiotic he had created. So there's there's so here's some evidence
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.840]   And of course, there's all that stuff on his website. You can look it up
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.280]   So I decided back during the pandemic days
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.840]   And this is something I decided i'm a tinker
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:18.680]   I wanted to know hey, is this gonna work? So actually, you know, we as you know, I'm as many of you did
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.520]   You know, we got sent home right to close the office told us all to go work from home
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:28.040]   So I figured hey, I don't have to go to the office anymore. I'm gonna get up at eight o'clock shower every day
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:34.040]   I can get up at seven 55 roll over jump onto my desk and log into zoom, which a lot of you guys working from home
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.800]   Do so, you know, I don't have to do that whole freaking hour prep
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:42.040]   You know, and i'm thinking hey, well, this is you know great opportunity to try this tink
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:48.600]   So I decided to start tinkering with it. And so I decided hey, i'm gonna give it a try. So this is my experience here. You know, can you
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:56.040]   Modify your body odor or can you reduce yourself to like just naturals? You know, can you manage your body odor?
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:02.920]   This is the key bio hack your body odor with a skin microbiome probiotic the answer is yes
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:08.120]   David Whitlock did it and I did it. So now what I did was this is my test
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.920]   So back in the pandemic days where I did for three months
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:17.080]   I decided that hey, you know what i'm gonna give this a try and I did not take a shower for three months
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:23.480]   And so this is my story. I first of all I got I acquired the mother dirt product called ao mist
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:29.080]   And I just want to say that you know for whatever reason they discontinued this product in 2022
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.240]   Don't know why
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.960]   And but there are other skin probiotics on the market if you just search for them
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   And you could probably try other different strains and things like that if you want to repeat the experiment and you're as crazy as I am
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:47.880]   But basically back then though I did buy the mother dirt aos mist and I just followed the directions
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.920]   And then I just stopped showering and instead of showering
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:56.920]   I used a probiotic on my skin to see what would what the effect would be and I wanted to see if David Whitlock
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.560]   You know what basically he said he stopped smelling
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:04.840]   I want to see if he was telling the truth. I tried it for myself and what I found out is that by week two
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.880]   To four so somewhere in there
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:13.080]   In my experiment, I reached what I would consider peak stank
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:19.960]   You know it's back then I live in in Hawaii right and go to the dog parks and taking my dogs for walks in the heat all the day
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:27.240]   Every day right and and I was like, okay. This is my discovery was, you know, you don't you don't stop smelling
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.680]   It just it takes a while that was my first observation
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:38.360]   You're you're applying a probiotic mist yourself your stinky parts and you don't stop smelling
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.360]   You just gets it just gets
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.840]   Stinkier and stinkier and stinkier and you reach this peak stink
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.720]   And this is when the norman coefficient kicked in. This is my dog norman
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.240]   This is my my little man. I love this guy more than anything
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.680]   And so him and I were back in the pandemic and we're living together
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.640]   Kid went off to college just the two of us. I don't think I could have done this if I had a spouse
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:06.280]   I don't think the spouse would allow me to have done this experiment
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.560]   But it's just the dog and I and so the norman coefficient
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:16.840]   This is the uh aspect of the experiment that I gave this term to was that norman and I would sleep on our queen size bed
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.480]   And norman up into this point. I've had him for nine years now
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.400]   So back then I'd had him for several years and so norman sleeps right here
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.480]   This isn't this is a diagram of calmer sleeping in his bed with norman
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.560]   And so norman would always sleep right here
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:33.560]   He'd and so I'd reach out and he had pet him and he just sleep right next to me every you know for years
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:39.080]   He'd sleep with me and then so but what I discovered that the norman coefficient on the experiment
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:44.520]   Was norman after about three weeks decided he was not going to whoops
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:49.880]   He was not going to sleep there anymore. He decided that he was going to sleep down here
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:56.440]   At the bottom of my bed and so he would not no matter how much I coaxed him to sleep
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.840]   Were you know like sleep next to me?
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.200]   I kind of you know keep my hand on him at night and he would just like nope
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.920]   I'm not doing it and I'm not going to sleep next to you and so for like of several weeks
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:11.800]   Norma would only sleep down here at the foot of the bed and he would not sleep next to me
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.120]   And so that's when I started to think maybe the experiment was not going very well
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.760]   And and witlock was you know full of bs
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:26.440]   When your own dog rejects you you've got to you know, you have to do some self contemplation and how bad you smell
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.520]   So, but you know bottom line though is I wanted to stick with the experiment
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:35.320]   And so you're irregardless of my dog now rejecting me and would not sleep with me
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:41.240]   Because I smelled so bad. I decided to keep going and so what I did though was I decided okay. Well
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:47.400]   Even though the you know the instructions were using it weren't very clear about exactly what you should do
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:52.920]   Around that same period of time when I had reached peak norman coefficient where he stops sleeping next to me
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.680]   I decided maybe I should just use some water and a washcloth
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.240]   And just do a little bit, you know a cleaning up
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:04.680]   And I did that and then I reapplied the ao mist and so after I did that
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:11.560]   I discovered that you know that the smell had peaked and that it started to go down to what I would consider
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.480]   what i'm calling
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:18.040]   Nominal stink and at that point about you know the month two
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:22.440]   uh, you know like two weeks after or so like that and
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:28.840]   Yeah, I really really started kicking in that the actual probiotic on my skin started kicking in
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:35.800]   I wasn't as bad and then the norm the norman. This is all measured by the norman coefficient the norman
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.680]   Started sleeping next to me again
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:43.240]   So by month two norman was right back to where he normally would sleep with me
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.200]   Right next to me and then nothing changed after that
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:51.000]   So if you have a norman, you can definitely do this and repeat this experiment
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.360]   But the funny part was was you know that when the dog rejects you that's when you know you've reached peak
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.880]   Uh, and then you know when he comes back to you, then you know that's starting to work
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:04.920]   So I did it for three months and for the like I said the rest of the experiment after three months
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.560]   Uh norman was like totally normal
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.880]   Sleep right next to me and then my own interpretation of my smell
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:18.520]   Was that I had reached this kind of like this equilibrium and I know that it's really hard for all of us to judge our own smells
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:22.520]   You know everybody's like that. I mean, you know people at fart and all that stuff
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:26.840]   But the whole idea is that you know, I it's it was that I did have another being
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.520]   In my home kind of you know weighing in on my experiment
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.720]   So I just wanted to point that out that this wasn't just an objective
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.680]   Measurement of my own opinion. I I had another being in there judging me
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:45.240]   But the idea of the here was that you know, I discovered in my experiment that your stink will continue to go up
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:51.000]   If you use you know water in a washcloth and then reapply the probiotic and you do that a week every week
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.720]   Then eventually the probiotic kicks in
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:33:00.200]   And it brings you down to this nominal stink level where you're just sort of you smell like a human
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:05.400]   You know and and you just and it just tailors off and it just remains consistent
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:10.840]   For months and so that was it and now why did I only go three months and not you know all these years
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:16.680]   There is a drawback to not showering. I discovered and this is what whitlock never did mentioned in any of his work
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:21.160]   Was that there's a drawback to not showering and I discovered it was exfoliating
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:27.720]   Uh, and so you end up with this then I'm just gonna be honest. It's tmi. I know but you end up with a crust of skin
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:35.480]   That doesn't get washed off. Okay. Um, and so even though your odor is being taken care of your skin accumulation
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:40.200]   Becomes very uncomfortable. So I went back to uh, you know showering
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:46.360]   Regularly but not as often and ever since then I haven't had to reapply the aol mist
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.760]   Um, I don't shower daily like I used to when I was in the office
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:55.880]   Um, and it's most likely it's usually kind of weekly now and I maintain a nominal stink
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:01.000]   Uh, you know by my standards and of course norman standards. So there you go. That was an interesting experiment
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.640]   You guys should give it a try. Let me know how that goes for you now the other piece of information
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:10.360]   I want to really share now. This is charlotte garson. I don't know if uh, those of you guys who know
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:17.320]   Uh who her I think her father's name was max gerson the garrison miracle. Uh, she runs multiple garrison clinics
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:23.880]   She's a much older lady. I think in her late 80s. She's spent her entire life as a natural path
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:30.840]   Helping people uh, care from all sorts of different diseases through a natural means that her father had created the garrison method
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.720]   And so this lady is a lifelong
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.400]   health
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:40.520]   Person and healer and so in in a recent lecture she actually was talking about the hidden dangers
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.680]   Of of body odor and so I just wanted to play this with you and let's talk about what she has to say
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.280]   I didn't smell bad
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:52.840]   Perspiration does not smell unless you're toxic. So you say well, that's not sociable. It's not admissible
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:58.200]   I can't go out in the world like this. I got to stop this. So what are you really doing?
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:02.520]   The body's last desperate attempt to get rid of toxins through perspiration
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:08.920]   What is the normal way of detoxifying through the liver and the feces through the kidneys and the urine
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.720]   Breathing out to carbon dioxide and so on
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:16.200]   But when everything is blocked and the liver is overloaded and the kidneys are overloaded
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.320]   Then the body tries to get rid of things through perspiration
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:25.000]   You say oh nobody you can't do that to me. It's not sociable and you block it. You stop it
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:32.200]   So what are you doing? You're pushing these toxins right back into the lymphatics right back into the breast
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:37.800]   Then you surprise this breast cancer. It's a contributing factor. I'm not saying it's the only thing in men
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.720]   It's a different story
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:45.880]   Breast cancer in men is rapidly increasing. It's now what percent of female and in men it's particularly aggressive
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.640]   You can't use ointments or creams or minerals or anything
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:58.200]   Underarm except a little soap and water or maybe a little vinegar water and then you say yes, but I smell what's my answer
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.000]   Eat right and you won't smell
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.880]   Well, you know
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:09.720]   To all credits, you know charlotte gerson is not just about eating and you know, she should know that but you know
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.080]   This is just a clip
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:18.200]   But the idea here is she's right your lymphatic system is what you need to detox as I had already mentioned
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:27.400]   So step two in biohacking body odor is you've got to absolutely decrease your toxic load
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.000]   And how you do that is very problematic
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.880]   Okay, because it's takes a lot of effort and I did this
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.600]   Over 15 years ago, you know
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:42.680]   When I started my journey in tinkering and biohacking and wanting to just you know change my life
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:47.880]   Was that I one of the first things I did was you know throughout my microwave and all this stuff
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:54.600]   But one of those things was I went through my house and anything that touched our skin
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.760]   My my daughter was young at the time, but anything that touched us
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:05.080]   Or that we would smell right that would we would ingest in our mouths through our nose
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:09.160]   Or you know, or through our skin I got rid of and I replaced with
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:15.880]   The natural organic non gmo virgin, you know, and that virgin version of it
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.800]   So all of the household products that were just incredibly toxic
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:26.200]   Out the door replaced with, you know, natural stuff sundries the same thing our soaps and our shampoos
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.760]   I even put filters, you know, like like chloride
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.760]   You know chlorine filters on the showers and all of that stuff
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:37.080]   And then in terms of my daughter being female and her wanting to get into cosmetics
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:42.120]   I had to spend big bucks on the healthy stuff and not allow her to do what you know
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.520]   What most women do which is very unfortunate?
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.880]   Ladies if you haven't looked up the research on that
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.200]   By the time you're 30 if you're an active person who uses cosmetics
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:57.480]   You have absorbed at least three pounds of lead by the time you're 30, you know through your face
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:03.560]   And so you know cosmetics are one of the most toxic ingredients you could put on your skin
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:08.440]   Your household products your cleaning products your laundry soap literally is the number one
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.240]   Problematic toxic chemical in your house
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.880]   You know as laundry soap
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:19.480]   Making sure you're using natural soaps and of course all the sundries toothpaste and deodorants and all that stuff
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:24.760]   Right if you're using it, you know, it's got to be where you have an eye on what's going on
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.920]   You've got to stop poisoning yourself with all these toxins
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:34.600]   Right and that affects your body odor and then at the same time you've got to learn how to detox
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.280]   You know, you know and get because you're no matter what you're still going to absorb it
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:42.680]   You're going to absorb it just driving down the road and all the all the fumes coming off of all the cars
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:46.520]   You're bringing that in you're constantly in taking toxins
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.080]   So the best and the more you can do at home
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.320]   Right the lower your exposure and then secondly you've really got to focus in
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:59.080]   On detoxing so stop masking stop plugging up your your skin allow your lymphatic
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.280]   You know system to basically, you know get rid of it
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:07.400]   And if you have a body odor problem and and like as charlotte garson just explained
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.880]   It's because you've reached that toxic load and your body can't handle it anymore
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.440]   And it starts to excrete through your skin
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:21.560]   So if it's excreting through your skin, you've got it issues you really need to deal with and so if you decrease your toxic load
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.640]   You do some detox
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.720]   for toxins specifically
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.040]   You're going to see a way
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:33.480]   It is the way to biohack your body odor and decrease yourself down to a nominal
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.120]   Stank
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.840]   And so the last one here is the antioxidants and as I mentioned earlier in the video
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:47.720]   The society of integrated dermatology in a 2001 paper put out a report that's basically titled two noninol
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:52.040]   Newly found in human body odor tends to increase with aging
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:56.840]   And so bottom line it was a paper that proved the existence of old people's smell
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:03.080]   And they they basically concluded through their experiments and their study that the fatty acid smell
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:09.800]   Was was the result of oxidation, which was the result which is basically your rancidity
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:17.000]   Meaning that okay, and this is what this paper proved and this experiment proved was that that smell
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.160]   old people's smell
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.320]   is the result
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.640]   of the fat tissues in their bodies going rancid
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.320]   Due to oxidation, which is caused by you know free radicals
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.880]   Okay, let me say that again that
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.480]   Old people will have that weird smell
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.720]   Because their bodies are going rancid
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.360]   now try to imagine the
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:47.080]   Basically, it's the fast lane highway to death
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.400]   Is to take the where your body starts to be your body's
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.880]   Basically mutating your fat cells into rancid
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:03.960]   Assets red rancid oils and you're now you're living with all this rinsidity and and the idea here is that hey your your immune system
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.200]   Is working over time on all the other crap going on in your world
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:16.600]   And now your own body is poisoning itself because you literally are going rancid and you're offgassing all of that rancid smell
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.400]   That's being interpreted as old people smell
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:26.120]   Or the fatty acid to nono no no no and that's that's really it and then when I read this paper I was like whoa
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:30.600]   Again, I you know, I do not want to smell like an old person. I hate that smell
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:36.840]   Nothing against old people here, but I just don't like that smell and I am you know nearing old age. I guess
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.640]   I don't want to smell
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.600]   And yeah, I need to overcome my programming, but I don't want to smell like that
[00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:50.120]   So one of the most important things you could do your third step in biohacking your body odors
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.200]   You've got to be just chugging
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:42:00.200]   Anti-oxidants and the older you get you know, right? This is this paper concludes that it is a factor of aging
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:05.160]   So the older you get you should be really ramping up your intake of antioxidants
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:13.480]   And so when you look at the most popular antioxidants and these are these are these are part of my daily supplements is vitamin c coex i'm q10
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.080]   I take I take quarter. I don't see you big one all
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:23.480]   It is a version of that. I take I take a full spectrum of vitamin E. I take glutathione with l lipoc acid
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.000]   It's activate the glutathione. I also do among like clear hydrogen
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.600]   You know, I do that as well and but my favorite is and then I usually as you all know
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:36.440]   Is I've been taking carbon 60 for like seven years now and I continue and will plan on forever
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:44.760]   Taking these super antioxidants to constantly be scavenging all of that oxidation stuff in your in my body
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.720]   It also is my way of detoxing by the way
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:54.440]   Antioxidants are electron donors. They will go after the toxins, right? So you've got a two birds one stone
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:59.560]   It'll knock out the toxins and detox you from a toxin standpoint and it also
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:02.200]   manages your oxidative stress
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:05.160]   So if you're really adamant about
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.360]   Not wanting to
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.760]   Have a strong body odor as you age
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:16.280]   Which is indicative of the quality of your health then you really need to pay attention to
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.720]   really really high intake of antioxidants
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:25.320]   And that's why I take all of these different antioxidants because it does that it does two of those things
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:28.920]   That's really the key point here. It'll help you detox the toxins
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.240]   And it'll also help you
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:38.200]   Oxidize, you know those free radicals so that you don't have your fat cells in your body going rancid on you
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.360]   Okay, and that all ties into what body odor?
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:50.600]   So that's it guys. That's how you biohack body odor really really need to pay attention again to your skin microbiome
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:56.200]   Try a probiotic for your skin. If you're taking one for your gut, why aren't you taking one for your skin, right?
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:00.920]   Really look at what your toxic load is make sure you're detoxing and reducing intake
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.120]   And number three again, you should be taking a
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:12.120]   Bloodload of antioxidants to stab off, you know, stave off all of those issues that the you know oxidation creates
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.840]   Which one of them is body odor. All right, so there you go. Hey, thanks for watching
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.440]   Hope you found this content interesting
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.280]   I just wanted to share the research that I was doing and then just I kind of like what I'm doing
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.960]   And just as an fyi the one piece of this that I haven't
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:30.200]   Done yet for myself and I'm really looking into it now is doing saunas
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:37.000]   Because saunas is really critical in stimulating your skin your lymphatic system into basically, you know working
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.200]   And keeping the pipes open and so forth. So I'm looking into that
[00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.600]   That's my last little step because I do all of these things
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:49.560]   I do all three things to manage my body odor and as I mentioned, you know, I I reached a point where if I'm wearing clean clothes
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:55.480]   I'm perfectly fine to go out in public and I have a daughter and I do ask her, you know, I do ask her
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:59.400]   Hey, how do I smell? She's like you just you smell fine. So I know that what I'm doing works
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.560]   Well, I have a dog that's will now sleep with me
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.120]   And I have a human that tells me I'm okay
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:09.400]   So that I know hey what I'm doing is working and so that's kind of how I'm biohacking my body odor
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.560]   Which is biohacking my health
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:15.080]   So anyway, if you found this content interesting appreciate if you like and subscribe
