[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.800]   I'm your host, Kay Almer, and this video is part three in the series.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.720]   What is quantum energy and how does it work?
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.080]   So I just want to make sure everyone understands where I'm coming from.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.640]   And the disclosure here is that this video covers my theoretical
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.480]   interpretation on how quantum energy works solely based on the results of the
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.120]   studies that have been commissioned by Leila Quantum Tech.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.480]   As you know, and I have an entire playlist called the benefits of quantum
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.320]   healing that's been documenting all of the various studies and the results from
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.560]   them of using Leila Quantum Tech devices and services, as well as kind of,
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.280]   you know, compiling some of the testimonies that have been popping up on the
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.200]   telegram chat group in terms of what people are experiencing from an anecdotal
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.920]   standpoint. So what I've tried to do is make some sense of that and look for clues
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.760]   in the existing, you know, architecture and literature of science that could
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.400]   possibly explain, you know, how are we getting these results from these
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.120]   devices and services? And so that's what this video is all about.
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.240]   And I just wanted to share with you what I'm thinking, what are the clues that I
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.120]   found that could possibly explain this stuff and just open that dialogue and
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.040]   just kind of just throw it out there as the very, you know, first, you know,
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.840]   left brain interpretation of what's happening. So that's kind of what this
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.920]   video is. And if you're if that's something that's interesting to you, then
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.880]   feel free, come on, come along on the journey here. So the very first thing I
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.960]   do want to level set everybody is the idea of, you know, what are what's going
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.880]   on with the devices. So there's two things, if you're not familiar with it,
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.840]   there are physical devices that are these are called quantum devices.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.680]   This specific one is called the Lele quantum infinity block. And what they
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.880]   do is they basically emit a quantum energy, you know, I part one and part two
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.160]   discuss what that is. So now there's quote, a means of exposure, right, in
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.000]   terms of how these studies have been done and all the people using them. And
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.240]   the first thing is, is there's a there is a difference between being inside,
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.480]   which is number one, you could expose yourself to this quantum energy and the
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.040]   frequencies by being inside of a block. And that means being in between the
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.160]   plates, which is something completely different than number two being within
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.480]   the field. And there's a whole another video probably discuss that. And then
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.760]   number three is in terms of a means of exposure is being outside of the field,
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.840]   but still exposed to the quantum energy via quantum entanglement, which is where
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.040]   the quantum upgrade service comes into place. So those are the three ways that
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.560]   participants of the studies have been exposed to quantum energy. And in these
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.000]   studies, and so each one of these things have produced results that will go
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.440]   through in a second. Now the other thing that I want to kind of clarify from a
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.560]   level set standpoint is that the modes of action again, and I did mention this,
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.880]   but I want to make it really clear that what we're talking about here when it
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.040]   comes to these devices and the service is we're talking about energy. And we're
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.520]   talking about frequency. And so now if you for those of you familiar with
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.000]   later quantum tech and even with for those of you who are familiar with
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.440]   frequency medicine, you know, I do want to stipulate something that most people
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.120]   probably hadn't thought about was that the energy itself is frequency because
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.760]   everything is frequency. So the energy has its own frequency signature. And
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.520]   then on top of that frequency signature, you could add additional frequencies.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.560]   And that energy is the carrier of frequencies. So everything is frequency,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.960]   you are frequency, the planet, the universe, everything is frequency. So the
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.240]   energy itself has frequency, which is one of the explanations for the fact
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.960]   that there's three different services, not just these three different services,
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.840]   but there's three different energy signatures as part of the different
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.440]   services that are offered. But we won't go into that. So here's the here's
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.000]   where it really comes down to me and my theory and what I'm thinking that I
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.160]   just want to, you know, toss out there into the universe and and see what you
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.320]   guys think. But what I've done is I've just really kind of compiled and there's
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.880]   literally over 60 studies. And over here on the right side of the screen is kind
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.680]   of a bullet point of what the results have been. And so we've seen and these
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.120]   are all again, you know, NIH level, double blind placebo sham studies. And I
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.800]   mean, they're very, very much held to the gold standard of scientific studies.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.080]   They've been done by professors and universities and and you know, very
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.000]   reputable clinics that do studies for a living, etc. And so there's all these
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.760]   different institutions and clinics and professors and scientists that have been
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.560]   doing all of these different studies. And like I said, there's over 60. So but a
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.440]   bullet point of what the results have been in general, you know, overall at
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.520]   very high level, is that when biological beings, right, mostly humans, I don't
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.520]   think they've from recollection of they tested dark field microscopy on blood
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.880]   from animals, but definitely all the blood, you know, studies have been done
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.240]   on human blood and people themselves as a whole being. And so what they what
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.440]   they've seen in the studies show is that when you're exposed to this quantum
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.160]   energy, all right, that it increases your white blood cell count. All of a sudden
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.760]   your body is producing more white blood cells. It expedites wound healing,
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.360]   which is essentially cellular, you know, cell growth, right? Cell
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.120]   replication, you know, your cells activate and create more cells. So
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.360]   expedites that it improves the oxygenation of your blood. It decreases blood
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.440]   clotting. It stimulates cellular detox and it stimulates plant growth. So
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.840]   when plants are exposed to the quantum energy, they grow faster and produce
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.360]   more whatever fruit they're, you know, whatever produce that they they produce,
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.120]   they actually produce more and they grow faster. And these are all been, you
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.000]   know, this has all been documented. Now the other thing that happens here is
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.560]   that it improves the bio energetic markers and bio resonance markers on
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.360]   people that have been exposed to the energy. It also improves the heart rate
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.080]   variability. So these are things that are, you know, these aren't biological
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.760]   processes. These are just measurements of stress on the system or intolerances
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.760]   and so forth, you know, to whatever stimulus. But it's actually showing
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:47.960]   that from a biological process that there's an actual improvement in
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:53.400]   biological processes from the from the energy itself, not and not just actual
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.600]   physical, you know, more cells, faster growth, you know, so there's a kind of a
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.280]   distinct difference. And that's kind of how I'm categorizing it. The other thing
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   too, I just recently did the video on the study on food intolerances. And it's
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.120]   show it's definitely displaying that subjecting substances, this, you know, in
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.720]   this case, food to the energy, it then, and then when you, and then when people
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.120]   are, you know, exposed to that food, then they're their tolerance level or, you
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.600]   know, their intolerance level, I guess, goes down. So in other words, if you're
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.600]   allergic to something and you put it in a in a block and then you eat it, you're
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.160]   not going to have as much of a reaction to it based on that study. And based on
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.600]   my own personal experience, if you go take a look at the first video I did on
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.440]   allergens in the benefits of quantum healing series. Now, the other thing too
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.600]   is that this is one of the most remarkable things to on on the study that
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.280]   was done on autism and the anecdotal testimonies coming from individuals
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:58.040]   with ADHD, and their exposure to energy and frequency, they've reported to you,
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.800]   you know, it alleviates the symptoms of their conditions. And now that's
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.400]   really fascinating from the standpoint of, you know, what is autism and ADHD,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.920]   it's not, you're not growing cells. It's not a biological process. You know,
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.280]   it, you know, they're not, you know, it's not, they're not, you know, like an
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.360]   element, they're not food. So like, you know, what's really happening there,
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.120]   and I try to break that down. And, you know, and look for clues as to how to
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.680]   explain that. And so now what I've come up with is on the left side of this
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.160]   screen here, and where I've kind of grouped them. And really, when I look
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.240]   into each one of these actual quote results, and I kind of look at like,
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.360]   okay, in the science world, you know, let's say we'll call it the hard science,
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.320]   and this is the soft science, right? In the hard science world, you know,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.240]   like what does, you know, how does like in other words, my question to myself
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:52.680]   was, how does white blood cells get created? How does what is, you know,
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.320]   what is the process of wound healing, you know, cell regeneration? And every
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.320]   one of these things right here, in this little box on the top right, is
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.560]   stimulated due to ATP. And ATP is the output of your mitochondria. It's the,
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.840]   it's the energy that your biological system uses to fuel all the other
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.080]   things that are going on in your body. And so one of the things that we do
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.960]   know from a study about quantum energy, is it actually causes an increase in
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.160]   ATP production. And so all of these things you see here on the right these
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.240]   six bullets, they are because ATP goes up. So you can say, well, these things
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.520]   happen because ATP goes up, right? So of course, the question is, how does
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.280]   how does the ATP go up? But that's really what's driving what we're seeing
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.680]   in terms of growth, you know, you know, things growing. And the other one,
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.960]   number two would be, and this is, you know, a kind of a stretch, but you know,
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.080]   I really have been thinking in terms of, okay, you know, energy is energy and
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:59.200]   then energy is also frequency. So if as in the world of frequency, you have a
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.560]   couple of things going on, that really are the, you know, the, you know, it's
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.240]   the actions that are happening, you know, like basically mode of action. And
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.440]   when you have frequencies, is that it's, there's a somatic response, you know,
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.600]   frequencies create shapes. And then there's a resonance response, right, you
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.520]   know, which is all about resonance and entrainment and things like that. And
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.760]   so when you kind of put that into perspective, then you can kind of explain
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:30.840]   and maybe, you know, as a clue, as a possible theory, that the changes in
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:36.960]   semantics and resonance of a person's at the cellular level. Now remember, all
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:42.080]   of this is happening at a quantum level. So, you know, so it's subcellular, but
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.680]   even then when you say, Hey, you know, what happens? And in other words, how
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:52.400]   does your bio your, you know, bio energetic signature change from not good
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.400]   or bad to good? You know, just because you're exposed to this energy. And my
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:02.360]   theory is that it has a lot to do with semantics and resonance, right? Because
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.320]   there's no ATP involved at that point. I mean, there's ATP being increased,
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.160]   right off the bat, it might be because of ATP. But it's not necessarily a
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.280]   physical response. In other words, you're not growing more cells. It's
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.960]   actually your systems functioning at a more efficient level. And therefore,
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.680]   you are now more tolerant towards external stress, like EMF, for example.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.120]   And so that's kind of where I'm kind of going with that one. And then number
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.280]   three would be the food intolerance thing. Now, what's interesting about the
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.400]   food intolerance thing is that there's no consciousness involved, you know,
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.960]   it's just they put the food in there and it gets charged. Well, what's
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.440]   interesting about that is there's a study going on right now in Germany,
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.960]   where there's a chemist that's been studying just that. And instead of food,
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:55.120]   he's been studying what the effect of the quantum energy block is on on a
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.000]   substance, you know, one of the elements of the periodic table, zinc. And he's
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.880]   discovered that he's actually able to measure something now, which is, you
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.800]   know, which is great, because now we finally go, okay, he's, you know, we're
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.440]   actually be able to, you know, put it on a meter and go, Oh, yeah, when this
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.840]   happens, then we see it in this, and, you know, in this format, in this format,
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:19.880]   is that it alters the redox potential of the zinc, which then makes it, you
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.040]   know, then, you know, that could, that's a clue right now. It's okay, you've
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.480]   put the zinc in a block and it changes the redox potential of the zinc. It's
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.480]   still zinc, but now it's, it's got this different redox potential. And, you
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.480]   know, I'll get into what that means. But the whole idea is now, Oh, now we're
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.760]   able to detect an actual physical change of a substance, which then we know if
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.600]   you put the food in there, it's going to just be like zinc and there may be
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.440]   that. And this is the whole maybe part. This is the clue is maybe this is
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.480]   what's actually driving what we're seeing in terms of food intolerances. And
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:54.760]   then of course, getting into the, the changes to, you know, the alleviating the
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.640]   systems of autism and ADHD, you know, I think, and this is my theory, is that
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.920]   there has, it has a lot to do with the consciousness aspect of the energy. And
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.320]   that's a whole huge discussion. And we'll get into that. So let's just jump into
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.280]   each one of these individually. I wanted to share my clues with you. So you can
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.000]   kind of see like what examples have it been able to find that can kind of
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.440]   examine, you know, just basically, you know, give you an example of what this
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.520]   possibility may be in terms of like an explanation of how does it work? So
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.440]   first things first, you know, mitochondria is in all of our cells. It's just a
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:36.760]   process of our of our cells that then takes essentially takes glucose and
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:44.200]   converts it into into phosphate. And then the phosphate then releases ATP. And
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.800]   that's how, you know, I'm just going to keep it really short. It's it's its own
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.000]   subject. But the idea here is simply that energy goes into your cell, into your
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.240]   mitochondria, mitochondria converts those that energy in the form of electrons,
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.760]   and then converts the glucose into ATP into phosphate or triphosphate molecules.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.560]   And then they get released back into the system and then are used as energy.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.760]   Okay, that's probably the shortest elevator speech I can come up with on
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:17.000]   the Krebs cycle. And the calcium ion exchange process. Ta-da. But here's the
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.520]   thing, when you look at that ATP cycle, then what I really want to point out is
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.720]   that, hey, guess what? It's all about energy and it's energy into the
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.680]   mitochondria and there's energy out coming out, you know, coming out. And it
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.880]   all has a lot to do with electrons. And that's one of the questions that I
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.920]   have still on the table that I have not been able to really come up with a good
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:43.880]   theory for. And that is the quantum energy, these devices and these services
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:49.720]   affect electrons. I don't know how, but they do. And that's that's kind of
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   what it is, because you cannot have more ATP for no reason at all, then, you
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.960]   know, you're sitting in a block or sitting within the field, and all of a
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.440]   sudden your ATP goes up. I mean, there's, what is the explanation for that? And
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:08.080]   the, and in my viewpoint, and my theory here is because that energy
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:14.080]   stimulates electrons. It doesn't give you electrons, like, let's say, you
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.920]   know, like, you know, by electrics does, but it somehow pulls electrons
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.440]   somewhere else in your body, and then puts them to use in a different way.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.640]   And that's kind of this weird link right now between quantum energy and
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.280]   its effect on electrons. But clearly, though, when people are exposed to
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:37.400]   like quantum tech devices, they do have an increase in ATP, which translates to
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.880]   an increase in energy, which translates to all of this incredible stuff that
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.080]   your body does when you have more ATP. And so here's the thing, though,
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.920]   here's the clue. This also happens with other things, right? So when you take a
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.880]   look at the effects of the quantum energy on blood, it's very similar to
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.640]   the effect that you have when you, and when you induce energy in the form of
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:07.560]   PMF, which stands for pulse electromagnetic field. And for those of you
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.840]   familiar with it, you know, it's I won't get into it. But it's basically a
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.440]   blast of electrons into your body and has got all this entire science behind
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.720]   that. And it's very beneficial. But when you see the blood results from
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.080]   individuals from the before and after treatment for PMF, you see the same
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.360]   results in their blood that you would see in using quantum energy. Now, the
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.480]   same thing again is with taking C 60. So those of you guys who know me, you
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:41.440]   know me, you know, I'm really, you know, really into C 60. And that's it's a
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.880]   carbonylotrope that uses the health supplement among other things. Now, it's
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:52.520]   essentially this molecule, a carbon molecule is an electron donor. And so you
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:57.400]   once you ingest it, it starts grabbing electrons and donating it to all other
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.720]   things that need to, you know, that are electron negative, you know, and then it
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.280]   donates the electrons, and then it starts doing its thing. But when the you take
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:12.080]   the before and after pictures of blood, and then someone takes C 60, boom,
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:17.240]   there you go. Again, it's electrons, a C 60 is donating electrons to the blood.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:22.040]   And all of a sudden you start seeing the improvement in oxenogen, oxenogen,
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:28.600]   wait, sorry, oxygenation of the blood. And so that's kind of really, you know,
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.160]   this is a huge clue, because when you start seeing that other forms of energy
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:38.200]   in the form of electrons can do what it does to blood, then that's sort of kind
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.680]   of you can draw a line between a this is from the dark field microscopy study by
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:47.400]   devil and Dr. Beverly Rubik on the Leila quantum site. And you can see the
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:53.480]   effects of quantum energy on blood. And so the three pictures here are before
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.080]   they subject the person to Wi-Fi, when they're subjected to the Wi-Fi, you can
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.480]   see it has a huge damaging effect on blood. It coagulates the blood. And then
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.440]   the moment after they're exposed to quantum energy, everything loosens up
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.240]   and and the blood starts flowing freely, which is super healthy. In fact, it's
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.680]   flow. Look, if you look at this third picture, it's even better than when they
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.840]   walked in the door. So, you know, they, you know, someone walks in the door,
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:23.520]   they're kind of, you know, normal, I guess, then they get subjected to a
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.280]   stimulus and then all of a sudden they're better than normal. And so you're
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:33.600]   seeing this result with PMF with C 60, in other words, injection of electrons
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.880]   into the body or the manipulation of electrons is now causing this incredible
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.640]   beneficial effect on blood through the use of quantum energy. And at the end of
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.040]   the day, at through the use of, quote, energy in whatever form it comes in.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:54.280]   So that's sort of the first clue about how to explain, you know, some of these,
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:59.680]   you know, I guess, you know, cellular growth type of results that we're seeing
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:05.480]   is because purely because of this ATP relationship between quantum energy and
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.480]   electrons. Now, the other thing too. Now, when we talk about, let's going back
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:15.080]   to this diagram right here, in terms of improving the biological processes,
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:20.280]   right, bioenergetic markers, heart rate variability being coupled. Now, this is
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:25.080]   where I my theory, it is a stretch, I acknowledge that. But I'm thinking about,
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.800]   in my mind, that there's this relationship between resonance and
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.680]   somatics and the results that we're seeing. So to explain what resonance is,
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.160]   and this is something that I've been really deeply involved in for a long time,
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.440]   because of my work with biological magnetics. And it's the idea of cellular
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.760]   resonance. And there's been a few scientists out there, I won't go too deep
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.480]   into the detail. But there are scientists out there who have created devices that
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.880]   will resonate your body like, you know, like like a tuning fork, like you would
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:01.160]   with a piano or a guitar. And it's like a human tuning machine by which they play
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:05.840]   it plays frequencies to the body. And then your body starts to heal itself. And
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.560]   that's a through an action called resonance. And what I want to kind of
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:15.560]   show you is this little clip, where an individual basically demonstrates what
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.440]   resonance is. And so what happens here? And this is a demonstration with two
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.360]   tuning forks that are the same frequency. In other words, one would be, let's say
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:28.320]   this is your cell in your body. And then there's an external stimulus that's
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:34.560]   going to then play the exact same frequency of your cell, right to your body.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:39.560]   And then what happens? You know, is there a physical reaction when the right
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:45.080]   frequency for the particular cell in your body is played to your body? And so
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.320]   let me just kind of just show you what happens. Just watch the ping pong ball.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:55.760]   Turn to sound. So the sound is getting transferred. There you go. So this one is
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.760]   making this one oscillate due to resonance. So that's really it. In the
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.920]   other, in other words, even though they're at a distance apart, when a frequency
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:11.120]   that matches a frequency of a cell is played to that the cell that's receiving
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:17.160]   that frequency begins to vibrate. Okay, and that vibration is resonance. And how
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:24.240]   does that play into what we're seeing? And is in my mind, if you start to, let's
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:30.640]   say, you know, we're all at some level of damage, right, in terms of our cellular
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.720]   health, all of us are, you know, we're born that way pretty much at this stage
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:39.000]   of modern history. And so when an external influence comes in, it starts to
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:47.320]   tune you, right, then you will then have a greater biological process. In other
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.480]   words, it'll be more efficient and more improved. In other words, you get better.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.840]   You heal from it. You're tuned. Your cellular resonance is getting tuned by
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.840]   these frequencies. Now it also works in reverse. So the other thing here I want
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:05.120]   to just I really want to demonstrate that how frequencies affect cells. So this is
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:11.280]   from a TED talk. And this is the opposite of of using frequencies to to stimulate
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.480]   biological processes. This is a demonstration of how frequencies could
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:22.320]   also be damaging to yourselves, which is something that a gentleman called Dr.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.560]   Royal Raymond Reif created or came and discovered back in the 1930s. And he
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:33.520]   described it and he named this process M O R, which stands for moral
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:38.160]   oscillatory rate. And he had discovered that frequencies could do harm just as
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.760]   much as they do good. And the point of this demonstration is to show you
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:48.320]   clearly that frequencies play a distinct role on cellular structure. These are
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:55.440]   the first videos taken. We showed these videos to our friends in the biology
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:01.480]   department. They said they hadn't seen anything quite like it. Seems to be a
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:09.400]   new phenomenon. So really what that video shows is it shows the frequency a
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:16.840]   more frequency that's tuned to not to you know, not to resonate the cell, but to
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:22.560]   literally destroy it. And so it goes both ways. If you can make a cell, if you
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.720]   can destroy a cell, then you could heal the cell. And that's my point here. And
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.680]   so what we also see here is there's a before and after picture. Again, we'll
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:36.240]   look at some dark field microscopy of human blood subject to frequency. And
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.120]   this is through using a Reif device called a Healy. And so you can see the
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.640]   the the person here, their blood was in really bad shape. And then once they
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.360]   were exposed to the frequency, then the opposite of what I just showed you
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:53.760]   occurs. It's a huge improvement. So the right frequency makes all of the
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.840]   difference. And that's the point I'm trying to make is that resonance and
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.640]   the frequencies that is used in the lay of the devices, as well as the
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.000]   quantum energy itself, which has its own frequency signature, has this
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.960]   capability of what I would what I would consider to be a tuning frequency
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:18.560]   that helps your body tune right to your optimal health. And you know, and
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.560]   that's kind of what's you know, the fascinating part about this is that it
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:28.360]   is happening. And then this is a possible correlation of how to explain why
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.520]   that's working that way. The other piece of frequencies, though, is called
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.480]   somatics. Now, for those of you, you know, most of you know, you play
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.920]   frequency to any substance, it's going to resonate. And it's going to
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.640]   resonate. But what's what's really amazing is this is where the geometry
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.440]   comes into play. So in part two, you know, I talked about Walter Russell and
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.240]   his correlation between, you know, elements and their their existence in
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:55.560]   the energy, you know, in the energy universe is based on sound. Well, you
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.360]   know, that's how you kind of manifests itself with somatic. So as
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.760]   different frequencies are played to let's say sound on a on a table, then
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.480]   it starts to form shapes and then does that with water and it also does
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.920]   that with blood. So in one of the experiments that the Leila head
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.760]   commission was with the Emoto Institute. So if you're familiar with
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.560]   Masato Emoto, he's the author of books, one of the most famous books
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.920]   on water, which was messages and water, where he basically in his lab
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:31.760]   in Japan, he had proved that not only does sound vibration and he
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.960]   was using not just sound and vibration, but actual words and words
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:41.600]   and consciousness of the words, right? And he was using those as
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.040]   stimulus to water and then flash freezing the water to take a look
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.040]   at, you know, basically, what was the somatic result of the word sound
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.240]   and vibrations that he was subjecting them to. And so he kind of had
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.640]   this huge body of work and he's famous in his world. And so now the
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.160]   Emoto Institute studied the glala quantum block. And this is the
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.880]   results from the study that's on the site. And one of the pictures
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.640]   that I grabbed off the site, which showed, you know, basically,
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.480]   this is water before it was subjected to the lala quantum block.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.400]   And then after it was subjected to quantum energy, and you could
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:19.480]   look at the somatic improvement of these water crystals by they
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.840]   became basically perfect. In other words, if this was, you know,
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:26.120]   in world mostly made of water, you know that. So try to imagine
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.920]   that when you're near in the blocker, you've got quantum
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.440]   upgrade running and all the water in your body is being
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.240]   structured. That's the term for this. And now you've not only
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.920]   gone from this basic geometry of your of your cells of the water
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.760]   in your cells, but now your water in your cells has been
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.520]   structured. And what would you know, and then what would lead us
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:52.440]   to say, well, if it's structured, and you become basically tuned
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.080]   from a geometric standpoint, then well, you know, what is that?
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.560]   You know, what is what's the result of that? And in my mind,
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:04.640]   this is my theory is that the more you are structured. In other
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.000]   words, you know, that you've been you've been tuned from a
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.040]   resident standpoint, you've been tuned from a somatic standpoint
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.680]   that you're more perfect geometrically at a quantum level,
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.280]   the more efficient your body runs and the more healthy you
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.880]   become, because it starts through basically improve the
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.320]   efficiency of your body, because you are basically perfect at
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.800]   this point, or you're becoming perfect, your cells are being
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:34.480]   stimulated to process and operate at the most optimal level they
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.760]   could be, because you can just imagine, you know, energy
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.360]   flowing through a structure like this is not going to be as
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:45.080]   as, you know, as efficient as energy, you know, basically
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.520]   being transformed or transported through a structure like
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.480]   that. And that's, that's my theory. I know it's a stretch
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.720]   guys, but I'm really thinking that semantics has a huge
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.760]   role in all of this is not just resonance, but it's also the
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.760]   geometry of what's going on. And so one of the interesting
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.320]   things in this research for this video was I ran across a
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.520]   researcher now he's an acoustics physics researcher, his name is
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.680]   John Stewart Reed, and he was talking about sounds on the
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.120]   effect of blood. So let me go ahead and play what he say they
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.000]   had to say. The blood starts off life when when we when it comes
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.600]   from the blood bank, it's very, very dark red. I mean, it's
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:28.200]   like a kind of deep, deep maroon sort of color. But as
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.800]   soon as we put sound into the blood from this in the
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.480]   microscope instrument, the pattern became bright scarlet,
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.240]   really bright scarlet, right? And then when we stopped the
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:44.720]   sound, the here was the scarlet pattern still staying in the
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.840]   in the blood. And we were like, what? How is it possible? And
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.760]   then, and then we just left it there and it took, I don't know,
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:58.360]   it took at least 15 minutes to gradually dissolve away this
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.280]   pattern, it was just sitting there, this pattern, you know,
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:06.480]   normally, with water, you put inject sound into the water, a
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.680]   beautiful pattern will emerge almost like a flower, you see,
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:14.080]   like a flower emerging on the surface of the water, stop the
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.360]   music or stop the sound, and it just literally vanishes, it's
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.480]   gone, right? But not with the blood, it just stayed there.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.480]   And that is the amazing point that Mr. Reed is making is that
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:34.440]   that he can see the pattern in the blood from the the frequency
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.480]   that's being played to he can see the somatics. And so he's kind
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.280]   of just saying, Hey, you know what, just like Emoto discovered
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.280]   that there's a somatic pattern in water, which obviously
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:46.640]   translates to you, you're mostly water. But you know, your blood
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:51.200]   picks up also picks up a somatic response forms these
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.160]   geometrical structures within your blood. And what's
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.800]   interesting that I think the most interesting thing about his
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.240]   clip is that it lasts up to 15 minutes as opposed to you turn
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.760]   the frequency off and water the, you know, the geometric, you
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.440]   know, patterns disappear. But with your blood, they last up to
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.520]   15 minutes. So, you know, these, this is where, you know, I
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.000]   really wanted to kind of stipulate the clue about this is
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.080]   that I really believe that somatics has a huge role in what
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:22.480]   we're seeing in terms of the improvement of biological
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:27.920]   processes. So now I want to just kind of take a tangent. And I
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.040]   want to talk about somatics from the standpoint of its
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.640]   mimicking nature. And so, and why I want to bring this up, it's
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   just another clue. Because in all of the other research that I've
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.680]   that I've done and for other things, one of the things that is
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.400]   most pronounced to me is, you know, again, everything is energy,
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.280]   everything is frequency. And how does that manifest in terms of
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.600]   matter? And so one of the things I want to share with you is the
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.720]   idea that quantum energy and, and I, as I mentioned in video, the
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.400]   part one of the video series is, I believe, and this is my main
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.960]   theory, is that quantum energy is the fifth element of nature.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.520]   It's ether, ether, whatever, you know, whatever different
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.800]   term you want to use, Akasha or grown, you know, you name it.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.320]   But it's the fifth element. It is nature. This is quantum energy.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:21.440]   It is the very fabric of the universe. It is part of nature.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.280]   It is the fifth element of nature. And so when you start
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:30.640]   thinking in terms of, okay, it's nature, then it's, you know, it's
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.520]   driving as part of nature. Then one of the thoughts that I had I
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.640]   wanted to share with you was that I believe that also that the
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.520]   somatics that we see all around us are a representation of the
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.800]   frequency of the earth, the frequency of the cosmos. And I
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   know that it's a huge stress, but you know, stretch, but it plays
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.800]   into the concept of how do you stimulate biological processes
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.240]   just by simply changing the geometry of your cellular, of
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.800]   your, of your quantum signature of your cell is, you know, of
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:01.120]   yourselves, your cellular resonance, you change it
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.960]   geometrically. And so, and then how all of a sudden you start
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.440]   seeing these incredible efficiencies in biological
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.080]   processes and you start feeling better and all that. I mean,
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:13.280]   you know, that's a really, you know, far stretch to try to connect
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.880]   those two. But if you think in terms of quantum energy
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.640]   stimulates nature, it is nature, but it, but the increase of that
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.920]   ambient quantum energy around you by, you know, charging
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.120]   yourself for being within the field or having energy sent to
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:32.000]   you, then in my opinion, there's a somatic response. And that
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.440]   somatic response is is mimicking nature. And so one of the
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.680]   things I do want to point out, and this is this comes from the
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.280]   work of Victor Schalberger, which this guy was the water wizard,
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:47.520]   and he's a really famous guy in his time. And the thing about
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.720]   him that he discovered, and this was a thing that makes him so
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.640]   amazing. And he's got tons of books written about him. And in
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.960]   the book Living Water, there's a story about, you know, how,
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.000]   you know, about his life. And what he did was he went into
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   nature and he just studied nature. You know, and he, and he
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.720]   discovered that nature was perfect. It worked perfectly. And
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.440]   then, and then, of course, man comes along and starts drawing
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.360]   straight lines and, and doing all the stuff that man does. And
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.880]   it's less efficient. And so one of the things that's really, you
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.880]   know, one of his great discoveries was he studied the flow of
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.880]   water. Again, it all comes back to water. And he studied the flow
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.480]   of water. And he basically made a proposal to this logging
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.200]   company, because they were, you know, logging companies use
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:39.040]   water shoots to move logs from the wherever they started from. This
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.000]   is back in that day, right? And you remember those old, old,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.600]   tiny logging videos? And so they would throw the log on to a
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.880]   water, you know, kind of like a water slide, you know, at a big
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.840]   water park. And these logs would then go all the way down, down
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.320]   the mountain, and then dump into a river. And then they would
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.200]   float the logs down to the, to the mill. And is very inefficient. I
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.720]   mean, you know, and so he basically proposed a change in the
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:07.120]   way that they structured their water shoots. And he increased
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:12.800]   the rate of flow and the efficiency of logging greatly so
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.840]   much so that he that's how we began making a name for himself,
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:19.960]   working with commercial industries by using his theories of
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:26.080]   nature. And it all, in my opinion, Schleberger's work is the
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:30.640]   discovery of the natural cymatics from the frequencies of the
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:35.360]   universe, and applying those cymatics those those those visual
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.880]   structures out in nature. And then by then using those
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.920]   structures showing, and this is my point, by following the rules
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:48.000]   of nature or the way that nature works, which is driven by
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.040]   frequency, it increased the efficiency of everything that he
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.800]   changed, he changed it from how it was originally designed to
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.560]   let's let's follow the rules of nature, right, and which is
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.480]   cymatics, which then improve the efficiency of whatever
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.720]   processes, commercial processes, he applied his theories to. And so
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:13.600]   now what's real, you know, to kind of close this point on why I
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:19.200]   believe cymatics plays a huge role. And in cymatics equals
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:24.000]   quantum energy mimicking nature. And that's why equals the
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.800]   improvement in biological processes and the results that
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.440]   we're seeing in the studies. I'm sorry, I know it's a
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.520]   really long stretch. But because of that, one of the
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.640]   interesting things that stuck in my head ever since I read this,
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.240]   and this was like almost 10 years ago, there was an article in
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.680]   the American Museum of Natural History that popped up. And it's
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.760]   I don't know why it's one of those weird things, but I never
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:48.560]   forgot about this article all these years later. And it's
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.080]   always just stuck in my head as like an amazing story. Anyway,
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.600]   so the American Museum of Natural History ran this article
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.720]   called Linking Trees Fibonacci Sequence to Solar Power
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.120]   when student a young naturalist award. Okay, so here's a 13
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:07.680]   year old kid, and his name is Aiden. And back then, he was
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.600]   out in the forest one day looking at the trees and he noticed a
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.280]   pattern just like Scholberger. And so he decided for his science
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.120]   project. This is a 13 year old kid. For his science project,
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:23.760]   he constructed a model tree based on the Fibonacci sequence of an
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:30.480]   oak tree. Okay, using PVC pipes as branches and PV solar panels
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.080]   as leaves. And what he did was when he started testing his
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.720]   prototype solar panel that was based on the geometric, you
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.360]   know, formation of nature, he mimicked nature using solar
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:49.440]   panels, his solar array, which is the most amazing result in this
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:54.400]   13 year old kid, he confirmed that trees outperformed the
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.600]   traditional model, which is your rectangular solar panel that you
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.960]   see everywhere, that it outperformed the traditional
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:07.520]   rectangular manmade structure in winter by as much as 50%. And he
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.680]   won an award for that. Now try to imagine the increase in
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:16.960]   efficiency of solar panels when rearranged in a in a in a
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:21.680]   geometric form through the semantics, i.e. nature's, you
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.080]   know, configuration of just follow nature, and it increased the
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.680]   efficiency output of the solar panel. Same solar number of
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.520]   solar panels just arranged differently in a geometric form
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:38.240]   increased the output, the efficiency of that array. And so
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.760]   that's my, that's my, you know, I'm linking these two, you know,
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.160]   that hey, you know what, when you when you improve the geometric
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.600]   structure of something, it's going to increase the it's going to
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.040]   improve the biological efficiency of that process. And
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.840]   that's kind of that point there. And it's I know it's a stretch,
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.880]   but that's what I was thinking. Now number three, when you start
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:02.400]   looking at redox potential, and this is where it gets really
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:07.280]   crazy. Because again, it's like quantum energy has a
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:12.000]   relationship to electrons. It obviously kicks off ATP, but it
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   also electrons again, it changes the redox potential. Now for
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.760]   what that is in redox potential is also known as oxidation or
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:25.200]   reduction potential or p, but it's a measure of how easily a
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.760]   substance loses or gains electrons in a redox reaction. So
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.800]   there's electrons going back and forth between, you know,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.760]   between the atoms. And so that you know, that's as deep as I
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.800]   want to get into that. But that's the definition. And so when
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.080]   the scientists, as I was talking about earlier in Germany,
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:47.920]   that this chemist is actually measuring the changes in redox
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:54.560]   potential of zinc, he can now confirm and duplicate that it's
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.080]   it's what's it's what's changing that maybe that maybe, you
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.000]   know, it might be something completely different, but that's
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   what he's able to identify. And studies going to come out on
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.160]   that where he's out, out there and he's measuring a change now.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.560]   So it's the first time in all of these studies in the last
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.960]   three years, we've actually, you know, any any one of the
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.520]   scientists has actually been able to measure what's
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.560]   specifically happening and what's even most important is that
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.720]   there's no humans involved other than, you know, the
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.360]   observer, right? But you know, so, you know, there's clearly
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.160]   some consciousness involved, but the idea here is that it's
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.040]   happening all by itself with the block. It's not being done on
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.200]   people, it's being done on zinc. And so now the electrons are
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.320]   changing on zinc and then I go back to, Hey, how does that what
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.040]   does that mean? Well, when we start saying, Well, how in the
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.400]   world does a block change food so that all of a sudden you're
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.600]   not going to react to it as badly if you're semi allergic to it or
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.880]   allergic to it? And here you go, there's a study that just came
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.760]   out a couple of weeks ago, I did a video on it on food
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:57.520]   intolerances and people who were gluten intolerant or
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.160]   diabetic and sensitive to sugar, right, were fed, you know,
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.120]   where I'm not fed to, but from a bile resonance standpoint,
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:10.800]   they were exposed to right food that was had gluten and cheese
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.480]   and and also the diabetics were exposed to sugar from a bile
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:21.040]   resonance standpoint. And it improved their tolerance of those
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:27.360]   substances from anywhere from 44 to 75%. And so now if you
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.080]   if you follow us in the telegram chat group in the quantum power
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:34.000]   group, there are numerous testimonies of people who are
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.640]   allergic to citrus or allergic to this or that I'm
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:40.320]   personally, I personally have a problem with MSG. And I myself
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.120]   have done these studies, I put food in the end, you know, I've
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.640]   eaten food with MSG and its cause reaction, I put the food,
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.000]   the same exact food that caused the reaction, I put it in my
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.840]   infinity block and then I eat it, no reaction. So how in the
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:59.520]   world is that happening? And this is a clue that there's
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:03.520]   something happening with the electrons of that substance or
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.800]   the food. And because of that change in the electron, the
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.640]   redox potential, all of a sudden it's no longer, you know,
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.320]   negative to our bodies. And how is that all happening? To me,
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.920]   again, we go back to this optimization of, of, you know,
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.800]   nature and the efficiency and all of that. And there's
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.840]   something about quantum energy. Don't have a clear theory on it
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.440]   yet. But it changes stuff. And it changes it to be more
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:31.040]   harmonious, which is another aspect of nature. Right? Because
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:34.800]   if if anything, that's you could point to that's self
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.800]   balancing, it's nature. Nature is completely self balancing it
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.640]   always seek harmony. Water always flows the path of least
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:48.320]   resistance, blah, blah, blah. It's clearly the model, you know,
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.280]   that that we follow. I mean, that we should be following in the
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:55.280]   idea of quantum healing is nature. It's all about nature. And
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.000]   you know, and it's obviously again, it's a fifth element. So
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.240]   there, there lies a huge, really interesting thing that's
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.840]   happening right now with redox potential. And I think it's,
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.000]   I can't wait for that study to come out. And I think we'll
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.160]   learn more as we go along. Now, lastly, there's a couple of
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.600]   things I want to point out. And and this is where it comes down to
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:21.040]   autism and ADHD. The thing about this one. Now, obviously,
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.440]   you've got the ATP production, you've got the
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.960]   semantics, you've got the resonance. All of that's happening,
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.880]   all it and the redox potential, because you know, if you
[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.280]   stick your hand in the, in a block, it's going to change the
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.640]   redox potential at a quantum level, your body, right? So all of
[00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:37.200]   that's happening. But it's, you know, but it's resulting in
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.680]   different things that are, you know, we're seeing it different
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:43.440]   results from different things, you know, from the studies. But
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.280]   when it comes down to autism and ADHD, and specifically
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.720]   autism, now I'm not real super familiar with the condition.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:53.360]   But I, but I have read that, you know, there's a, there's a new
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:58.160]   study that came out in 2023 that linked, you know, mothers who
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:03.200]   had been ingesting diet sodas with aspartame. And it showed it,
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.600]   you know, statistically high number of those individuals who
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:11.360]   ingested aspartame produced children with autism. Of course,
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.080]   there's the whole autism and vaccine debate and a vaccine
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.080]   issue, which is mercury. So, so there is an element of
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.760]   poisoning that causes autism. So clearly, the other things
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.680]   that I've talked about are having a beneficial effect to the
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:29.520]   poisoning in the body's toxicity level. So that's happening.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.560]   But there's this other thing that Philip Bonholtendorf,
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.360]   the owner operator of Leila Quantra Tech, and I were
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.760]   talking one day. And he mentioned to me that from an energy
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:43.120]   worker standpoint, you know, these incredibly gifted, talented
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.400]   people that help people from, you know, they do energy work,
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:49.280]   right? He was basically saying that, you know, from that
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:54.080]   perspective, what they see for individuals with autism is it's
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:58.880]   not just a physical issue. That it's a consciousness issue,
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.720]   which is really amazing to, you know, to contemplate because it
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:07.040]   never occurred to me that an ailment could be a consciousness
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.640]   issue. And if you work on that ailment from the
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:14.320]   consciousness aspect, that it could then alleviate the symptoms
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.520]   of it. And so what he said to me, and I just want to convey,
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.480]   is that it's like they're picking up these energy workers are
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.680]   picking up that these individuals with autism, and it all
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.480]   depends, you know, I mean, the spectrum's really high, or you
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.360]   could have really super mild symptoms, or it almost, you know,
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.760]   you're almost fully functioning on, you could be all the way down
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.640]   to, you know, you know, individuals that, you know, that
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.840]   don't speak and can't, you know, survive in this world on their
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:41.040]   own. So his, he was saying that, you know, what they're seeing
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:44.320]   is that these individuals on top of having, you know, the
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.840]   potential for toxicity issues causing these, you know, these
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.720]   physical issues, but also to a consciousness issue where
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:54.560]   these individuals are trapped between two states of consciousness.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.360]   And so that, if you think about that, an individual trapped
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:03.600]   between two states of consciousness, so they're not fully able
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:09.120]   to kind of manifest in solely as one, in into one, and they're
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.760]   stuck between two, and that's why, and that could be a potential
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:17.600]   explanation to the energy workers, it is the explanation, as to
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:21.200]   why these individuals are not able to connect to themselves,
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.000]   and be like the rest of us, right, which are, we're fully in our
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.520]   bodies when we're conscious and we're functioning, but if you can't
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:31.120]   be fully in your body consciously, from a consciousness
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:34.320]   standpoint, you're not able to function, which makes sense,
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.440]   right? And so that, I want to just kind of stipulate something
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.680]   that I think is amazing to me is that, you know, I just been
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:47.120]   doing a personal study on pineal gland activation. And and
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.400]   something happened where I just really kind of like connected
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:54.480]   to what Philip was saying and what what happened was was, I've
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.200]   been experimenting with the new pineal gland activation
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:01.200]   frequency that Leila Quantum Tech just released a couple months
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.040]   ago, and I started and then so I was experimenting with that
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.280]   at night, and you know, there's lots of people in the quantum
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.080]   upgrade telegram group that are talking about it. And so, you
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.920]   know, it's really stimulating lucid dreaming and improving sleep,
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.720]   and so that was the frequency, right? And so I was like, okay,
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.960]   that's really cool. And I wanted to up it up, and I wanted to up my
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.480]   game on this. And so I started taking a peptide called pineal
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.160]   on, and pineal on is an amino acid peptide that stimulates
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:31.280]   your pineal gland. And by doing that, and after 30 days of
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:35.840]   doing that, I discovered that not only was the other stuff
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.400]   that people are reporting happening, but I also started to
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:43.760]   really, really, really, really start noticing that when I went
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.600]   unconscious, when I went to sleep at night, that my consciousness
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:54.240]   me left this body behind and went into somebody else's body and
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.280]   living their life through that through their perspective, because
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:01.600]   it was incredibly lucid. And what I discovered was there was a
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:07.440]   couple of times where when I had woken up, I was trapped between
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:12.560]   that body and my body. And I was having an incredibly difficult
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.840]   time functioning, you know, like trying to get out of bed, trying
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:19.840]   to just, you know, think and and do anything. And it would take,
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.440]   you know, sometimes minutes, one time it took an hour before I
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:28.000]   fully felt like myself. And I'm not saying that I'm not saying
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.440]   anything bizarre, like, you know, I now know what autism feel, I'm
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.560]   not saying that. But what I'm saying that is I've experienced
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:39.200]   now this incredible pineal gland activation, where my
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:44.480]   consciousness is clearly flowing between different states. And
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:48.080]   that I know now, what do you mean when he meant by that, by
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:52.480]   being trapped in two different states. And that feeling, I mean,
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:56.400]   just that, you know, that struggle to function, because I was not
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.800]   in fully in one and I'll still not, you know, I don't still in the
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.120]   other. And that's just kind of my experience. So there to me, my
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:07.280]   theory, my I'm sharing with you openly, is that I really, really
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.600]   connect with what he's saying about about autism is specifically
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:15.520]   about the conscious, the role of consciousness in this, in the
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:19.120]   quantum energy. And so it's just, I think that there's a huge
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:23.360]   clue there, there's a huge clue that could help us really get to
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:27.760]   understand how to help these individuals. And with ADHD, same
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:31.200]   thing, we've got, you know, these individuals went from, and one
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:35.680]   individual claim to have been cured of lifelong symptoms of ADHD,
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.920]   by simply using his quantum block, and the focus frequency, he was
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:45.680]   very, I think was, he was really, I think, using the inner peace
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.800]   frequency, as well as the focus frequency, but specifically
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:52.800]   focus frequency, and he did tons of, of experiments on himself. And
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.160]   he was, you know, obviously, with and without the medication, he
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.600]   had been described for it. And then eventually after a year or
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:03.600]   two, he declared himself ADHD free by using Leila quantum tech
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.680]   tools. And again, you know, that's, and it's all about that
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.440]   consciousness aspect. So there's this really interesting thing.
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.160]   And I just want to leave you with point number four, that
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:18.000]   amplifying, or that quantum energy, these devices amplify
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.440]   consciousness. And in doing so, amplifies perception. So there
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:26.080]   you go. I'll just leave you with that. Lots to talk about in the
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:29.440]   future as we learn more. Now, the other thing I want to kind of
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.640]   just talk about in the how does it work standpoint, is, you know,
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.760]   how do you measure quantum energy? And I do want to kind of cover
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.240]   this because people have asked in the telegram check group. And
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:41.120]   the answer is no, there's, there's, well, there's no device. Okay,
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:46.320]   there's no quantum monomer. But the way that you can measure it
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.920]   though, and this is the difference, you know, can I measure versus
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:56.000]   can I detect? And right now, to way to detect quantum energy is
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.120]   through muscle testing or dowsing. And dowsing, there's three
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:02.960]   different tools. Pendulum is what I use all the time. I've also
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:07.040]   used, you know, dowsing rods, like when I'm looking for, you
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.480]   know, geopathic stress and lines and things like things like that.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:14.320]   But also too, there's an actual device called Elector Antenna
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.960]   that actually then has a scale. And so you can actually start
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:20.080]   scaling these things and giving, you know, various
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:24.560]   reactions, you know, basically a measurement unit called Bovis
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:29.360]   units. And so yeah, there's a way to detect quantum energy using
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:32.960]   muscle testing, which is another form of, you know, just tuning into
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:36.000]   yourself and your body will tell you because your body is a
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.120]   quantum biology and it's going to react to the energy around it.
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.800]   So both basically, both of these techniques are ways to detect
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.760]   whether quantum energy. So if you wanted to charge an item
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.560]   and you wanted to see if the charge stuck, you could dows it and
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:51.120]   you could see that you could literally physically see
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.840]   that the item has picked up energy. And then if you wanted to
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:57.840]   actually try to measure it, I know people who are using muscle
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:01.920]   testing and then running, you know, basically doing muscle
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:05.760]   testing and then asking themselves, asking their bodies,
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.280]   you know, is this a 500? Is this a 700? Is this a thousand, right, when they're
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:13.280]   holding an object? And that at the point that their body signifies a
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.920]   positive result or a yes result, you can do that with
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.680]   dowsing is by the way at the same time. Then they go, okay, then
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:24.320]   based on my muscle test or based on my dowsing, I got a yes response versus a
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.840]   no response, then yeah, that number is it. And they just keep, you know, changing
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:31.120]   the numbers. In fact, one of my other videos, I talked about Lloyd
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:36.400]   Meers and Gregori Graboboy. And these two individuals have been
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:41.120]   basically converting frequencies into numbers. And that's how they've
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:46.720]   been doing it too through dowsing. And so, and muscle testing, so that's
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:50.560]   the only way today, for those of you who are interested in how to measure
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:54.880]   and how to detect quantum energy, is through dowsing or muscle testing. And
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.760]   then of course, you could then get more scientific about it
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:02.160]   by using the lecture antenna to then actually put it on a scale and you
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:05.680]   know, be able to just measure it in terms of, you know, numerical
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.200]   differences between levels of energy. Now you can do that again with muscle
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:12.800]   testing. But then you have to, you know, and dowsing, but you have to go up and
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.680]   down the scale. And then kind of just keep quizzing
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:19.280]   yourself to figure out where the number lies. But that's how that works. And so
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:23.280]   that there is a way to do it. It's not device oriented. However, I do
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:27.120]   want to point out something that I think is pretty interesting is that now
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:33.520]   that there's an actual scientific way to measure the change of a substance
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:38.400]   when exposed to quantum energy in the redox potential, then I'm theorizing
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.440]   right now. And I'm going to be following up on this.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:46.720]   Is it possible then, because we can see a change in the redox potential,
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:51.360]   that we could use that level of change to then use that as a,
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:55.600]   you know, like as a benchmark to then measure quantum energy and the
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:59.600]   differences and levels of quantum energy by the changes in the amount of
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.880]   redox potential of a particular element. So what I mean by that is,
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:07.600]   you know, every device, every meter out there, you know, it has to work off of a
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.760]   benchmark. And then that it compares it to the
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:13.040]   benchmark, then gives you the result. Right now there's no benchmark, right,
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:16.640]   for quantum energy. But if there is possibly a benchmark, and it's,
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.880]   it's in the change of redox potential, then it is theoretically possible to use
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:24.880]   the variance of change of that elements redox potential
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:29.040]   as a scale by which to then measure quantum energy and start assigning
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:33.520]   numbers to it, based on strength. So that's potential. I'll follow up on that
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:36.800]   and see what the experts think. And I think that might be a way to do it
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.680]   in the future. But you know, we're only three years into this. So a lot more to
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.000]   learn. Lastly, I just kind of want to talk
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.560]   about this whole issue about why don't I feel it? This comes up a lot.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:51.600]   You know, with people that comes under the umbrella of how does it
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:55.600]   work? How does it work is its vibration, its
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.400]   frequency, its energy, all of that stuff, right?
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:02.080]   And why don't you feel it? And why do some people feel it so strongly
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.880]   that they actually notice it and that it's in the room and they walk around
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.520]   looking for, you know, why why do they feel that way?
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:11.040]   And so it's all up and down the scale. And so that's kind of what that
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.720]   represents. So here's that same experiment. But this is the part of that
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.160]   experiment that I wanted to show you that what happens
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:22.560]   when you've got two tuning forks, right, you and the universe
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:26.800]   and so and then you put a weight on one of the forks, okay? Now watch the
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.040]   ping pong ball. The ping pong ball is you now, okay?
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:32.640]   And when you put a weight on a fork, it changes its frequency, okay?
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:37.440]   And so what happens to the ping pong ball when you are no longer
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:41.920]   the same frequency as as the other as the, you know, as the transmitting
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:45.520]   device. So here's, you know, an example here. You saw on the first one
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:49.120]   where the two new forks were the same, where they're tuned to the same
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.560]   frequency and you could see that that that resonance then would
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:57.040]   affect the ping pong ball or, you know, the vibrate, vibrate the ping pong ball.
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:00.640]   But here's what happens when you have two tuning forks, you know, that are
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:05.040]   the same frequency and you strike one, but the one that you strike has been
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.600]   weighted down. So now you're hitting it, but the
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:11.040]   frequency has changed. And what happens to your body? Here you go.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:14.480]   I've got a little, little bit on here that changes it. So what I'm going to
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:19.200]   do is show you. Notice the ping pong ball.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:23.520]   Doesn't move at all. Why doesn't it move? Because it's out of sequence. It's out
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:27.840]   of, it's out of resonance, okay? And that's my example, guys.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:31.200]   And so when you look at this Hawkins scale and I've removed the numbers because,
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.800]   you know, if you listen to the last recent interview with Luke Story,
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:38.400]   you know, we had Philip was on there with Ian, the scientific advisor for
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:42.320]   Leila Quantum Tech. And they talked a lot about the Hawkins scale and how it
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.680]   just doesn't apply. I won't go there. They had a great explanation.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:48.640]   Recommend you all watch that video. It's a great interview.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:53.680]   It just came out this week. And the idea here is that, you know, the
[00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:57.040]   let's say the levels as Hawkins had described
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:02.000]   that the alpha to the omega of consciousness. He tried to describe
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.960]   consciousness and he put a numerical scale to it.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:08.160]   And when you take the numbers away, it's still the same scale.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:12.080]   But instead, it's now not measured in numbers, but it's measured
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:16.640]   in levels of consciousness. And it goes all the way from the lowest level of
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:20.960]   consciousness is shame. You live in a consciousness of shame
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:25.440]   than guilt, apathy, grief, fear, and the higher you go, right?
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.400]   You go from this level of suffering, you know,
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.680]   you go into this level of where you're getting by
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.200]   and your consciousness is getting by. Then you get into this level of
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.840]   consciousness where everything's flowing really well.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.400]   And then you get into this consciousness of the pure
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:45.440]   dao, which is the consciousness of basically of love and peace and joy.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:49.600]   And then to reach enlightenment is the ultimate consciousness, the omega.
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:54.720]   And the idea here is that, you know, just like my perfect example, it's
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:58.560]   you ever talked to one of your friends is going through divorce.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:02.080]   Yeah, they lost their sense of humor. They're a different person because they're
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:04.720]   resonating at an entirely different level of consciousness.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:09.040]   And they're trapped in all of this fear part, right? It's a lot of fear,
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:13.040]   a ton of fear during divorce, a lot of guilt for the kids, a lot of shame,
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:16.480]   whatever, you know, but there's this huge, they're suffering and they're barely
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:20.320]   getting by. And so their entire mindset, their consciousness
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:24.480]   is trapped in this really super low level of consciousness.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.520]   And they're not going to be feeling love and joy and peace.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:31.840]   And that's my best analogy for the idea of levels of consciousness.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.800]   So and I'm not, you know, some not saying that you guys are like living in
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:39.920]   in modes of suffering. But when you think about resonance and that when
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:44.000]   your the frequencies are off and you've got this pure quantum energy
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.040]   that is being transmitted to you or you put on a capsule or you use one of the
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:53.280]   frequencies and you feel nothing and it does nothing for you.
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:56.640]   Well, you're pretty much out of tune. That's what I that's that's really what's
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:00.880]   happening here, guys. You're out of tune. And but here there's there's hope, right?
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:04.640]   Because when I first started this three years ago,
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:09.280]   I was completely out of tune and I didn't feel anything. I you know,
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:13.040]   I just I trusted Philip because he's my friend and if he said it did this and I
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:16.880]   just took him at, you know, just blind faith and I'm like, okay,
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:20.240]   I'll just give it a try and start tinkering around with these things.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:25.200]   And I made a video a couple of years ago of a major life change that I'd had
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:30.160]   after I had continually been upgrading my infinity block and I'd gotten to IB8
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:34.720]   and long story short, it changed my consciousness.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.840]   And I did I really wasn't doing anything other than tinkering around quantum at
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:43.360]   that time. And the higher level of consciousness
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:47.840]   slash quantum energy that I was being exposed to
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:52.320]   changed who I was that I had been a certain way for 20 years
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:56.480]   and it changed me and it improved me and it increased
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:00.560]   my consciousness to the point where I was able to make a
[00:59:00.560 --> 00:59:04.960]   major life change in my life. And I executed on it and
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:09.840]   I'm way up here now and this whole feeling of peace and joy
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:13.760]   and love, you know, and and gratitude. Gratitude is by the way
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:17.600]   is the strongest conscious state is gratitude.
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:23.120]   So I experienced this. So I know it for a fact that, you know, if
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:28.560]   if you first are exposed to quantum energy and wherever you're living in,
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.720]   you know, your conscious state, you may not feel it because you're probably in an
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:36.480]   area of love, I mean, a level of consciousness that's just not simply
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:39.360]   going to be in tune with the energy you're receiving, but
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:43.600]   don't don't let it go. I mean, because it will
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:47.120]   help you elevate, but of course you've got to do that in
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:49.840]   her work, you know, you've got to keep working on it yourself,
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:54.960]   but it will eventually get to that point where it starts to resonate you
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:58.640]   your consciousness and lift you up and then there will be a point
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.240]   where you'll look back and go, wow, life life life did get different and you just
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:06.640]   hadn't noticed because it's so subtle. Anyway, so that's that guys. So I just
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.600]   wanted to share that with you. Thank you so much for sticking with me on
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:16.320]   this one hour video just to explore what quantum energy
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.760]   does, right? How does it work? And this is what I'm thinking. These are my
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:24.320]   opinions. These are the clues. This is open for discussion, you know, and
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.200]   and let me know what you think. I really appreciate
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:32.800]   your involvement in this discovery process because we are on a journey of
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:37.120]   discovery in what these things can do and how can they do it.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.960]   And at the end of the day, the objective is how can we leverage
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:45.600]   this incredible technology to improve the lives of ourselves, our loved ones,
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:50.480]   our pets, and you know, and is it possible? Absolutely. So there's a whole
[01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.600]   bunch of studies going on, way more results coming out.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.280]   And so there'll be more and more addendums to this video series
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.040]   as we learn more and discover more. So there again, thank you so much for
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.440]   watching the video. I hope you found this interesting.
