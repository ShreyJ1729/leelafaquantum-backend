[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me Kay Elmer and in
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.400]   this video I'd like to share with you how to make your own C60 Black Seed Oil
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.680]   capsules. All right let's start in with the disclaimers. This material is for
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.400]   research purposes only. C60 oil is not approved for consumption by the FDA. You
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.720]   understand that making and consuming C60 oil is experimental and you do so at
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.200]   your own risk. I do not endorse, I don't have a steak and I don't have a product
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.440]   in any C60 type of way and I don't get paid for making videos and especially
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.520]   important in no way is anything in this video to be considered medical advice.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.320]   All right let's jump in. Okay so why would anyone want to use Black Seed Oil and
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.480]   so how this all started which was the last time I was doing the pricing update
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.160]   video the most recent one. I ran across the first time that I had seen a C60 oil
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.000]   encapsulated in pill form and so I was very intrigued and it was especially in
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.400]   Black Seed Oil and more even more important it was by the long live, live
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.040]   longer labs. I got that wrong with that ER in there because I'm OCD and want to
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.260]   make sure it's correct. Okay so live longer labs okay. So these guys that's
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.080]   Phil, Phil Catalano and Max Champi, really smart guys. They've been on the
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.160]   Sarah Westall and been interviewed several times and brilliant tinkerers
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.880]   just like us do it yourselfers and so I was like very intrigued so I I set out
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.440]   about a month or so ago and I decided to go ahead and make my own Black Seed
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.920]   oil capsules and so subsequent research has been very interesting and let me just
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.760]   share with you. So first of all if you go on the live longer lab site and you
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.680]   click on this this product and then you click on learn more you're gonna find
[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.240]   out all of these different benefits are listed on their website and you know
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.360]   they did a great job in terms of marketing the product from the standpoint
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.440]   of every one of these on the website links to a study and all of the studies
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.800]   support there's multiple studies for each specific bullet point and every
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.000]   study supports that bullet point so it's it's a really really really well put
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.200]   together you know marketing piece for the idea of how how incredibly healthy
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.280]   Black Seed Oil is and and I got to tell you I started from Ground Zero and this I
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.200]   never I heard about it but I never ever once bought it or looked at it or
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.320]   tasted or anything so this is a new thing for me as well but you know hey let's
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.600]   just take a look at it why you know so why is clearly you take a look at the
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.400]   the benefits and this is why you would choose this oil and as a companion for
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.520]   C60 because when you look at the benefits of both especially Black Seed Oil I mean
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.680]   look at the release pain lowers blood cholesterol decrease high blood
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.240]   pressure etc etc and then you look over here at the benefits of C60 you know
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.200]   it gives you more energy let's see if you know you guys are taking C60 but the
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.640]   whole idea is there's some incredible benefits to C60 incredible benefits for
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.360]   Black Seed Oil and they and they're not redundant so you combine the two and you
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.680]   have like a super supplement so this is a great idea good job Max and Phil and
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.480]   this is their new product that's been around for about three months now so and
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.600]   you know and of course in typical K-Omer fashion I'm gonna try to replicate
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.160]   this because I'm gonna do it yourself and so this is basically how to do it
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.240]   yourself if you are interested in either buying it or doing it yourself this is
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.680]   the idea that you would want to do do it yourself and so then really it's just
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.320]   so simple this is probably the easiest experiment I ever did which is buy the
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.040]   oil get some C60 I always have C60 on hand get some vegan capsules I always
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.640]   have vegan capsules on hand because I do a lot of encapsulation of my own
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.680]   various different supplements that I buy in bulk I buy bulk powders and I
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.320]   make my own capsules I'd save a lot of money doing it that way and so I always
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.840]   have these things on hand the equipment of course you know I have that on hand
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.680]   which is all you need is a beaker or flask a stir and a capsule filling
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.800]   machine and this is the model that I use and so that's it you don't really
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.080]   need a lot of stuff to make this stuff it doesn't cost much I'll get into the
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.560]   costs later in the video but that's really it so I went and went ahead and
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.520]   did this and this is my methods for the experiment I added the C60 to oil now
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.320]   what I always usually when I'm experimenting I always go with a 1
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.480]   milligram per milliliter i.e. 1 gram per liter kind of that's just what I put in
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.320]   I know a lot of you guys put in 0.8 0.6 0.5 you know a bit depending on oil but
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.840]   I always go with one because I want to know how what the saturation rate is
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.400]   going to be and you know whether or not how much of it actually gets dissolved
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.680]   and then I stirred for 17 days odd number I intended to stir for two weeks but I
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.280]   got busy I forgot to pull it off the stir and then I settled it for two weeks
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.840]   because two weekends later I went in filtering is optional I just want to
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.600]   remind everybody it's optional if you don't have kidney stones then you really
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   don't need to filter if you don't want to but you know I tried to filter it I'll
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.160]   get into that and then of course you encapsulate the oil and make your your
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.280]   capsules that's really it it's pretty simple now my observations while doing
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   this and I have your a little video for you is that it did the oil has a really
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.880]   strong smell and it took a little while to get used to it because at first I was
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.320]   like whoo I did not like to smell it and and you know when I smelled it it was
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.320]   the first thing that popped in my head was oh now I know why fill in and you
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.840]   know max put it in a capsule because there is no way that I would ever take
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.720]   a tablespoon and put that in my mouth there is just no way so putting it in
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.440]   a capsule where you just swallow it yeah I can that makes so much sense and now I
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.040]   understand why that's where they're selling it okay I mean I'm sure other
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.840]   other guys and other folks could probably just take it straight but I don't want
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.880]   to anyway when I went to try to filter it this is what was really interesting
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.440]   it will not filter at 0.22 I mean that's why I was my go-to you know I was
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.800]   thinking it's like olive oil and I was gonna filter it but it wouldn't it just
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.240]   like maybe like I don't know 20 drops and then stop for you know I just stopped
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.160]   so then I had to empty the funnel and change out the paper and I tried a 10
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.560]   that's my next level up is a 10 micron filter and then I tried that and it
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.240]   did filter through 10 but it would stop like halfway the filled you know the
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.840]   funnel on my filter my rig here's that my filter rig right there and so it
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.960]   would stop halfway so I had to change the paper twice so it stopped I did 125
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.280]   and then it would stop and then I emptied it out put another filter paper
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:23.120]   in there and it went another 125 and finished the the the batch okay and so
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.920]   it you know that was really interesting it was it's so thick it just doesn't
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.840]   filter well you know so that was interesting to me I never encountered an
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.680]   oil that did that and then lastly the residual C60 remaining there was some
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.640]   in the flask and some in the filter so as you know you have to guess and and so
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.840]   I was guessing that it's probably the same as olive oil like 0.8 based on the
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.600]   residual and you'll see that in the video here so here's my video it's not
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.080]   in my normal place in my kitchen because I got kicked out of the kitchen and
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.960]   so here I am filtering with a stupid pillow behind it so you can see what I'm
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.560]   doing and I got kicked out because the daughter was cooking and I couldn't use
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.320]   a kitchen but anyway so here it is it's quite foamy which was real interesting
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.120]   and this is with the 10 micron filter but you know other than being foamy I was
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.000]   and then the issues with the paper though without was it it just went right
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.720]   through and then I was good to go and then you know the foam does go away so
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.240]   it's not a big deal but I just thought that was really weird because I'd never
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.920]   seen oil do that okay so this was after I was finished and I got to get to use
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:29.800]   the kitchen again what was going on you see the foam was gone I filtered all of
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.840]   it that was in the flask and then I had you know had to go through two pieces
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.160]   of filter paper so the oil looked pretty good it's just like it's like kind of
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.320]   like syrup it's like a real light syrup really really really viscous and of
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.760]   course I got that smell and then of course here's the filter paper so you can
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.760]   see where there's definitely residual C60 stuck in the paper I mean really
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.360]   light I mean I used powdered right I didn't use pulverized pulverized would
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.680]   have you know I would have expected this to look like that with pulverized but
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:03.360]   this was powdered so there's no black at all I mean really the majority of the
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.000]   C60 was dissolved into the oil and but there was some residue very very light
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.520]   in the filter and then when you look at the bottom of the flask it's it's sort
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.200]   of light I mean the oil is black so it's kind of hard to tell you know but
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.560]   that's the bottom of the flask right there and you can kind of see where that
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.640]   when the oil drains away and I had a whoop let me just go backwards here I had a
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.960]   thought afterwards where I was thinking I should have just laid this thing on
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.720]   its side and let the oil just go away so I could get a real good shot of the
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.560]   residual C60 stuck to the bottom of the flask because this is oil and C60 but
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.760]   you can see you know I put a quarter of a gram in this thing and you can just see
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.480]   that real super light film but I got to tell you you know there was there was
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.680]   it was so light that you know there's no way I could have made another batch out
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.360]   of it and I've done that so many times now that I know what it looks like and
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.960]   whether I should bother and this is not a not to bother so I would say
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.040]   definitely that I had a probably about the same saturation as I would get with
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.800]   olive oil okay so this is a capsule filling machine that's what they call
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.640]   them I don't know if you if you guys make your own capsules I've been doing
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.440]   this for geez over a decade already you can see my machines all beat up I've
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.080]   got a couple of them and so this is really what you do with the capsule
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.040]   machine if you've never used one you basically buy like right here you'll see
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:25.200]   this right there in the corner there's a stack or just you know pour them out
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.640]   but there's you know you buy the empty I buy the vegan ones because daughters
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.480]   of vegetarian and she doesn't want to eat the gel capsules those gel capsules
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.880]   are made out of gelatin and if you all know what gelatin is and you're a
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.920]   vegetarian you're not going to want to eat that so it's made from animal
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.280]   products so we go with the vegan capsules and they're basically little
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.040]   capsules and you just you just pull them apart and you put the big end on this
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.680]   side and the little end on that side and then you just fill up the tray there's
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.440]   24 in this one they make these things up to like 100 and 200 you know they he
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.360]   make huge ones but this is the tiny one and then so now once the capsules are
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.800]   all stuck in here in these little holes you just fill it up and then a and then
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.920]   this is the thing I use double O capsule that's the size I'm using in this in
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.080]   this experiment or example it's double O they make triple O single O you know
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.040]   different sizes right and a double O capsule will hold one milliliter of
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.520]   of fluid inside I make and this is not the first time I've actually made oil
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.480]   capsules I usually do like I make oregano oil capsules and so forth I'm you
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.520]   know cut it with a coconut okay so then once you have filled up all of the
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.000]   capsules the the big end you just take the little thing you flip it over so the
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.600]   tops on them you know that you got the small end and the big end and you
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.480]   squish it and you pull in the bottom here goes up into the machine and you
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.360]   squish it together and it makes your capsules and there you go and they're
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.960]   all stuck in there and then they're stuck in there pretty tight so you know
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.400]   you can't pull it out I can demonstrate that see it's pretty tight so how you
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.200]   get them out is you push down on this part and pop they go they're just
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.120]   right out and that's it that's how you make capsules and you can use you know
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.400]   this is using black seed oil you can also make capsules with all sorts of
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.280]   other stuff I actually buy a medicinal mushrooms and bulk powder I get
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.640]   reserved at all and bulk powder curkerman and powder you know lots of
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.480]   different things in powder apricot seeds you know from my leotro that kind of
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.360]   thing so anyway that's just how you make capsules and so there you go this is my
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.960]   batch of black seed capsules so now in order to compare this was the thing about
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:31.320]   comparing on the live longer lab site they only express the amount of the
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:37.520]   capsule in there I'm sorry the gel capsule is in milligram so I had to I
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.920]   had to go for instead of going by volume which is you know milliliters I had to
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.320]   go with milligrams to determine you know a like for like dosage amount and
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.080]   like for like capsule to capsule comparison so it was important that I
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.240]   weighed the empty capsule and then weighed the capsules that I had made so
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.960]   that I could calculate exactly how much was in each capsule by milligram so I
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.880]   could do an apples to apples comparison to the to the product which I'm going to
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.240]   show you next okay and that's really it so the finished product is 923
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.760]   milligrams per capsule and this is how it kind of works out so how does it
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.640]   compare well live longer labs they advertise on the website that it's 46
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.840]   milligrams of C60 per 60 milliliters or 0.8 milligrams per milliliter and they
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:27.080]   have a 615 milligram gel capsule so my estimate as I mentioned was 0.8 milligrams
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.360]   per milliliter the same roughly outcome that they had but because I'm using
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:38.320]   00 1 milliliter capsules I came out at 805 milligrams per vegan capsule okay so
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.000]   when I checked on their site they don't have it on the site so I had to go ask
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.440]   those guys I you know I chatted with them they said the recommended dosage by
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:52.000]   live longer labs is 2 to 5 capsules per day so in the do-it-yourself world
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.520]   because there's it's a heavier capsule the dosage comparison charts is right
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.760]   here so they're saying two to five so this range right here so that would mean
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.640]   that you're taking anywhere from this is the total product this is oil plus C60
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:12.360]   1230 milligrams of with two capsules all the way up to 3,000 milligrams
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:18.000]   3,075 milligrams right here for five capsules per day that's their recommended
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.480]   how much you should take now if you did if you do the do-it-yourself like I did
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.840]   so for me for me to replicate this concept here I would take anywhere from
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:31.320]   16 if I took two capsules I'd be taking 16 all the way up to and you know this
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:35.960]   3,000 I would take and then if I wanted to do the full five a day I would just
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.760]   take four of mine because of the size difference but you know it's not like
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.320]   for like it's definitely you know but this is as close as you can come so the
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.440]   idea here is hey if you wanted to try it yourself you could get a really nice
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.160]   you get a really good dose just taking two a day and that would be on the low
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:56.520]   end of the recommended scale and the other thing too about this is that if it's
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:02.460]   0.8 milligrams right per lit milliliter and it's one milliliter per per
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:07.880]   double-o that means so if you're taking a teaspoon I believe a teaspoon let's just
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:15.200]   ask Siri what is how many milliliters in one teaspoon the answer is 4.93 milliliters
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.560]   okay so Siri says it's 4.93 so there would be 4.9 so let's say
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.680]   there's five capsules in one teaspoon so if you're used to taking olive oil one
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.960]   teaspoon at a time you got to take five capsules now if you are like me you take
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:40.000]   a tablespoon a day the tablespoon is 15 milliliters that's 15 capsules so you
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.920]   can see where there is a huge difference between dosing on capsules or dosing by
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.160]   teaspoons and milli tablespoons okay so keep that in mind because if you're
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.160]   looking to take anything in capsules like the way you take it by tablespoon
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.920]   you're gonna eat a lot of gelatin you know or you're gonna you know you're
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.640]   gonna eat a lot of capsules and you may not want to eat that many capsules but
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.560]   that's something to really keep in mind because I think that's the main thing
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.720]   that for me is a drawback about taking oil in capsules is you have to take so
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.880]   many to have the same dose that I take every day so I prefer just taking you
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:19.040]   know tablespoon a day but but but the Black Sea Dowl is pretty amazing and so
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.400]   maybe you know there is something to this I haven't tried it taking it yet I
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.880]   just wanted to bang this video out and then I will proceed to trying it okay so
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.720]   let's talk about the costs now it was really cheap to do this and this is what
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.960]   I want to point out here's to my three things I had to buy the oil the C60
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.920]   the capsules actually I know like I said I have this on hand and so eight ounce
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:46.520]   bottle on Amazon 2095 definitely get the organic one now I've got some C60 for
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.720]   150 a gram and so I used a quarter of that and that was 3750 and if anyone's
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:57.680]   asking how I got it so cheap just sidebar real quick the telegram C60
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.080]   chat group kind of formed a co-op and you know just like any other co-op in the
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:08.560]   world we all get together as a group and we buy in bulk and when you buy in bulk
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.920]   you know the price goes down and and so now we're buying C60 and bulk having it
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:19.680]   third-party tested so we know for sure that it's real and then we distributed
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.440]   out and we have this incredible volunteer and he knows who he is and
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.880]   thank God for him and he just volunteers his time and energy and he he's the
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.180]   he's the one that does the shipping and he ships out like so in other words we
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.120]   go out and buy a whole bunch and then you could buy one gram from us and at the
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:38.120]   bulk price and and it's all nonprofit nobody makes it dime it's all for the
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.560]   community and that's how I got this so cheap so anyway so a quarter gram is
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.680]   thirty seven fifty at the cost I pay for it and then the vegan capsules you get
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.720]   a whole bag for a thousand of them and it comes out like two cents per capsule
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.680]   but you know so you're gonna and then you're gonna make 220 capsules so six
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:17:00.560]   dollars and 16 cents which makes a total of sixty four sixty one now I want to
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.480]   point out this is important this sixty four sixty one represents how much to
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.840]   make for eight ounces now an eight ounce batch is roughly about 220 capsules
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:15.080]   assuming you're gonna have some spillage okay because eight ounces like 236
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.680]   milliliters all right so one milliliter per capsule okay so I'm figuring about a
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:27.440]   16 milliliter loss so you make about 220 capsules okay so now at at at this
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:33.840]   cost though at sixty four sixty one for 220 capsules it comes out to 29 cents a
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.000]   capsule okay and that makes it so now if you wanted to do a like for like
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   comparison because I want to go back up here this this right here this bottle is
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.080]   a hundred and fifty capsules so if I'm doing a hundred and fifty capsules of
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.920]   the do-it-yourself capsules it's only going to cost forty three fifty for a
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.960]   hundred and fifty and they weigh more okay and I'm not even gonna go there it's
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:02.240]   just too much math but simply put I can make a cap you and I can make a capsule
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:07.600]   for 29 cents a capsule and for a bottle of a hundred and fifty the of these and they
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:12.240]   do weigh more it's forty three fifty okay now live longer labs you know hey you
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.080]   know they're great guys love them if you don't want to do all this hassle it is
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.760]   you know you go buy it yourself and a lot of people prefer to buy that's totally
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.760]   cool by the way I'm not endorsing anybody you know that okay but the retail price
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:28.840]   for the bottle of the live longer labs this this bottle of 150 black sheet
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:34.360]   oil retails at seventy nine ninety nine so you know this is what my channel is
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.920]   all about is how to help people learn how to make your own and save money and so
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:44.320]   do-it-yourself you will save forty nine percent off the retail price by simply
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:49.880]   making your own capsules ton of there you go so it's a huge cost savings to do
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:54.680]   it yourself and it's it's so not expensive so and this is your materials
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:59.160]   cost okay now of course you have equipment costs and so this is a one-time cost
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.960]   you're gonna buy a beaker a magnetic stir and a machine okay so that I bought
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.000]   a six hundred millimeter beaker for ten bucks in telelab these are twenty or
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.840]   thirty bucks for that little blue stir which I talked a lot about in the last
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.480]   video and then you right now you can get the same machine I'm using you see in
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.200]   the video for fourteen dollars and thirty nine cents on swans and vitamins and
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.200]   so I'm figuring six bucks for shipping so the total right here is sixty bucks
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.600]   or sixty one dollars so you spend sixty one bucks get some equipment or you all
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.160]   probably already have this stuff and then you can go ahead and make your own
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:36.280]   capsules and save forty nine percent try the latest product in the c60 world
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.400]   what's got tons and tons and tons of awesome benefits and then you know see
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.920]   what happens all right so now lastly before I leave I want to just kind of
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.440]   just it's interesting because I've been poking around and there seems to be some
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.120]   trending on the black seed oil and cap insulation concept so ever since the
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.520]   last pricing guide and I'm not it's not attributed to me but ever since let's
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.480]   say you know like black you know like live longer lats puts out a new product
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.160]   all of a sudden the other people making c60 go he's making black seed oil well
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.320]   he's making it in capsules right so it's kind of cool what's happening now in
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.040]   the market if you kind of poke around is that and this is a sky runner on the
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:14.680]   c60 chat group great guy lives in big island aloha brought up and so this guy
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.480]   is has basically just now to the chat that he's he's coming out with a new
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:25.760]   product and so he runs the Mitra amrita sorry c60 and he's now created a new
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:32.560]   product with mct with black seed oil I think he said it was 80 20 and as as for
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.760]   taste because of the whole you know smelting he says it's not too bad or
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.160]   sorry he quote unquote it's not too strong so he's able to you know you can
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.440]   take it without having to encapsulate it so he's actually you know launching a
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.960]   black seed oil product mixed with mct because there's like I said there's
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.160]   no way you could just do straight black seed oil but this is interesting how
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.920]   he's taking it and he's mixing it with the new oil so new product here off the
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.440]   black seed oil concept and then over here at pure c60 olive oil real cool all of
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.640]   a sudden after live longer labs popped out some you know capsules black seed
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.400]   oil capsules they came out with an olive oil capsules in pill form that
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.360]   they're selling on their site so it's kind of interesting now this is the
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:18.400]   second c60 capsule product on the market I thought that was very
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:24.280]   interesting and again though I like again man if I had to take olive oil c60 by
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.680]   capsule you'd have to take I'd take for one tablespoon 15 of these so I don't
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.440]   know who this is gonna be targeted to but it is I'm not one of them and there's
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.840]   no way I'm taking 15 of these a day but you know but it's it's an idea I don't
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.480]   know if they're gonna you know I don't know how this is gonna work for them but
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.320]   I think it's great that they're trying something new and there may be a market
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.440]   for that so hey kudos to you guys kudos to you Skyrunner thanks for the tip on
