[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K Almer and this video
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:12.560]   is going to be a forensic analysis of the new calm and rest frequency offered by Leila Quantum
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.360]   Tech. So if you know anything about this frequency it just recently was released for sale on quantum
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.280]   upgrade as well as on a card at Leila Quantum Tech and it is the result of a contest that was
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.920]   held back in September of 2024 where Leila Quantum Tech just put out a contest that said hey we want
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.280]   to you know we want a better calm and rest frequency what do you guys got and over 70 people had
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.720]   submitted entries you know they put together their frequency sets and submitted them for evaluation
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.800]   took a few months and then the eventual winter winners were announced I believe like three months
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.960]   ago or something like that so so basically this is the new calm and rest frequency again it's July
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.840]   I'm sorry it's January 3rd today so it just went on sale yesterday and the frequency what's in the
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.840]   frequency is what this video is all about on top of the idea that not only is the this video describing
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.640]   what's in it but also the process by which we collectively as a group of individuals interested
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:26.640]   in this kind of stuff are using these contests as a way to let's say you know fine tune our you know
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.680]   our art you know or you know improve our ability to create frequency sets because one of the things
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.400]   that I pointed out in from the first contest which was pain management frequency contest was it's
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.600]   the first time that that we'd ever had an opportunity to have a bunch of people you know submit ideas
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.320]   and have one that became the winner so then you could compare what worked and then what didn't
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.000]   work and that's the first time that we can start really understanding what works so that as you guys
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.080]   go and make your own frequency sets this information is literally it's just invaluable because there's
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.520]   nothing out on the planet that will tell us this information there's no other way to learn what
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.280]   works and what doesn't work right because all you ever see you know for sale on everybody's websites
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.360]   there's multiple different sites that sell frequencies sets and you know and they're called
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.400]   different things like the biocharger people they'll call their frequency sets I think they call them
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.600]   recipes you know and so forth anyway so I digress but the idea here is you know not only is what's
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.160]   in this frequency but also you know what are the components of the frequency and the approach to
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.840]   making one that's you know that delivers the best results because you're going to want to know this
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.360]   for when you make your own frequencies for just home use so these two contests have really moved
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.240]   our knowledge in just a huge leap in the last year by being able to say hey you know people submit
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.400]   80 different 70 to 80 different entries and one of them wins well what's different about that one that
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.160]   that won the contest that was the best one you know versus the ones that did it and so now that's
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.840]   what the very first video in this series was for the pain management contest and this one is for
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.280]   the calm and rest frequency contest so I want to just say right off the bat what happened was was
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.240]   Philip said that he and the lately healer network they reviewed all of the frequencies and these
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.400]   are people who can feel and see frequencies you know they're very gifted and so they went through
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.880]   all 70 and there was a tie for first place and so the tie was between myself where I'd submitted a
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.760]   14 frequency set 14 frequencies in one set that I was you know submitting for calm and rest and then
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.840]   a gentleman by the name of Ralph from the European group he had submitted a frequency set that had 35
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.240]   frequencies in it and he tied for first place so here we are the two people that tied for first place
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.400]   if either one of us did not submit or did not participate then that person the other person
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.440]   would have been the first place winner according to Philip so this was first place except it tied
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.480]   so what the lately healer network discovered was that both of these individual frequency sets by
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:28.960]   both myself and Ralph won the contest but when they combined the two and they made a basically a 49
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.080]   you know frequency set but there's 49 right 14 plus 35 it's not exactly 49 but you know 45
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.200]   with that if you take out the duplicates but they put together a frequency set of both mine
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.120]   and Ralph's and that was even better than mine individually or Ralph's individually so that's kind
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.760]   of how that came out so then what you've got now is a frequency for sale that's getting incredibly
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.400]   rave reviews on quantum upgrade if you just read quantum upgrade the posts since yesterday morning
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.200]   on January 2nd and people are trying the you know the new brain frequency they're trying the new
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.640]   calm and rest and it's just they're getting it's just getting rave reviews on how much better it is
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.400]   than the old frequency and how much it helps people sleep you know they're the quality of their sleep
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.320]   so it works right so that's really cool that and I'm really proud that I actually got to
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.720]   participate at this level and being one of the ones that tied for first place
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.640]   so totally cool a little bit of bragging rights there so I'm pretty happy with that
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:38.480]   so what's in that frequency is a list here and I'm gonna I'm gonna make this a PDF and then you
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.560]   know put it out there so you guys can just go look at the video description if you want to get a
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.640]   you know a PDF of this this is you know this list but basically it's a combination of the two
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.120]   right so it's mine and Ralph's and so the ones that are in red are duplicates so I just wanted to
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.040]   point out that there's three duplicates so it's 45 minus three slurs it's a 42 frequency set
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.680]   because there are three duplicates right and so that's what the red ones are and then the rest of
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.120]   it is just you know what's in the frequency so I kind of want to explain my approach and then of
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.280]   course let me walk through Ralph's but my approach was where I had taken inspiration and this is what's
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.880]   really I think is important because this is a learning experience we learn every contest we
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.320]   learn something more right we just keep building our knowledge base and so when I looked at the
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.640]   winning entry for the pain management and I did analysis on on on what won and what didn't win
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.600]   which was what I had submitted I did not win that one but somebody else did and I'm like compared
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.360]   the two I came up with this set where I called it the summary of findings and you know what was
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.160]   going to be the new approach because I realized I approached it wrong in terms of trying to put
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.480]   together the set so this time I applied everything that I learned from the first analysis onto this
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.240]   one and bang you know I won so I'm pretty happy with how that process worked out but my approach
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:09.440]   was here where I actually went to following the my own guidance which was here this is let's see
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:16.800]   right here this was the summary of findings for the pain management frequency contest okay
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.920]   and so what I had discovered in that one doing an analysis between what won that contest and
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.800]   and and what I what I submitted that didn't win you know now I had something to kind of understand
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.720]   and study I realized that you know one of the things about approaching the contest was I needed
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:38.720]   to really approach the research with a feeling brain and not the thinking brain because it was
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.320]   just you know I really needed so instead of getting really really into it like I normally do do some
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.960]   hardcore research I just followed my intuition like how do I feel about this like oh what about
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.600]   this and how do I feel about that and I kept asking myself how do you feel you know should I do this
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.080]   and and it was just really bizarre to do that because I'm not normally that way but I constantly
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:04.400]   was just trying to intuitively sense what should go in the frequency set and so I totally relied on
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.160]   intuition and I never second guessed myself when I put together my set the other thing too was
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:16.240]   keeping everything natural and organic when I tried to do the pain management one I had tons of
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:23.280]   drugs in there you know pharmaceuticals no no bad that was bad synthetic all that chemical you know
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.360]   none of that stuff you know non-natural chemicals you know was was any that anything to do with you
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:35.040]   know ending up in the winning frequency set so I kind of said okay let me avoid anything synthetic
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:40.800]   completely stay with natural organic substances and natural organic stuff that's in nature right
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:46.720]   and then using a traditional and alternate or alternative medicine you know like like looking
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.760]   at like okay well how would the natural path approach this objective the objective for that
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:58.560]   frequency was pain this frequency was the objective was helping the body rest helping the body stay
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:05.200]   calm and sleep you know quality of just resting and so like you know so how would so my thinking was
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:12.320]   all right well how would a natural path approach this objective how would a homeopath approach
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:18.560]   this objective how would a you know an Ayurvedic practitioner or a traditional Chinese medicine
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:24.720]   practitioner right and so I really looked at all of these different natural traditional healing I
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.840]   call them the traditional healing arts because these healing arts that I just mentioned have
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.920]   been around for thousands of years whereas allopathy which are the chemical surgery you know those
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.040]   guys are at the white coats those guys have only been around about 150 years so you know when you
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.400]   take a look at who's got the most experience in in healing people it's definitely not people in
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.200]   lab coats so I really looked at how would these guys approach that and that was one of my things
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.040]   that I that I looked through in putting together the you know the winning set
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:02.240]   then also too is diversifying effects like you know trying to approach the the objective from
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.680]   different angles right that was another thing you can't just you know I learned from just looking
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:13.120]   at this and studying it you can't just approach a frequency from one angle so look at it from
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.920]   different angles and then include foundational support you know like and that's the thing that
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.440]   was real interesting about the pain management frequency winner was she'd included salt and water
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.960]   and I was like wow that's you know and I and when I thought about how incredibly intelligent that
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.800]   was to do that you know because it's so supportive of our body because we are literally we are
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.240]   salt water aquariums that's what we are I mean I think what's like 68 or 70 percent of our body
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:46.160]   is literally liquid you know all the cellular you know fluids your lymphatic system your
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.440]   everything's liquid you know we're very liquidy um and and we're essentially a salt water aquarium
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.480]   so why not provide that and that's what that person did and they won the pain one so I did that
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:02.560]   in mind guess what hey it won so less than to all of us and then less maybe best like I think in my
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:08.640]   pain management I think I'd like 60 something and then the winning one was like only 14 so I really
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:15.360]   backed off and said let me just less is best and then I this is the the six bullet points that I had
[00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:21.360]   followed to put together my set so this is my set I put in this like again if Ralph didn't if Ralph
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:27.680]   didn't submit a you know his entry I would have won by myself and the same thing with Ralph if I
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:33.840]   didn't Ralph would have won and I had a have a really funny story about my submission too and I'm
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:42.480]   like okay you guys like stories side story real quick I had gotten a phone call a week before the
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.800]   lately healing network we're gonna go and sit down and go through this stuff I mean literally
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:53.360]   the week before they were gonna go through all the entries I got a phone call from a lady in
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:12:00.400]   Washington state United States and she's like hi you know I got I got your I got your lay let's
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.920]   submission and I got your phone number from the from the paper inside the envelope and I'm asking
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.480]   so I'm talking this lady I'm like what do you mean you know I'm like I'm like you know like well
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:16.320]   first of all how'd you get my phone number and and you know and and and so it turns out that somehow
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:23.040]   my entry to the contest got stuck underneath a package at the Layla Factor you know warehouse
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.840]   or something and it got stuck there and and it got shipped out to a customer and she ended up
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:33.920]   getting my envelope with my my frequency entry she opened the entry and you know popped up to you
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:39.760]   know the open the paper of course it's got my contact info and then the list of this stuff that's
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.960]   in there for the contest entry and so she called me and I'm like oh my god you know like thank
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.120]   you so much for letting me know so I you know I let Philip know and they're like what
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:55.920]   how did my entry end up in in Washington it's just a fluke weird thing you know where it was just
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.280]   like this universe you know the universe doing this really strange thing but the lady was so cool
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:09.440]   where she calls me tells me she has my winning entry she thinks the list is great we chat for like
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.720]   an hour about Layla quantum tech quantum stuff and she's a healer and we're swapping stories
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.840]   great conversation beautiful person and so so I get ahold of Philip I'm like hey
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:26.240]   you know my I just found out my contest entry is in Washington and he's like oh you know he's
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.200]   sorry about that and so I sent him another one and it got there the day before they started going
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:37.200]   through things if I if that lady had not called me and god bless you for calling me I would have
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.880]   never even have known that my entry was not in the contest and Philip you know he says that he
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.960]   would have assumed that I would have entered and would have figured out that I'm missing you know
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.640]   when they went through the list right but you know it could have been overlooked so it's just
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.920]   really strange I mean it's like the universe works and so so strange you know that somehow
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:01.200]   no matter what my entry still got put in the contest so that I just think that's a just bizarre story
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:08.320]   anyway side so I'm sorry I'm back so this is what's in my my my entry which is the
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.840]   I decided to go with like okay what helps are you know what helps people rest and so when your
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:19.040]   brain is in a rest state it's in a delta wave brain you have delta waves right you have that's
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:25.440]   alpha waves for alertness and beta waves for all these different brain waves so the delta waves
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.560]   is what's going on in your head when you're sleeping I have a set of tuning forks for brain
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:37.200]   waves so I just use my tuning forks and I captured the delta brain waves into water and then use that
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:43.440]   as a source for the frequency that I added to this list of course I went with some essential oils
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:48.720]   that hold natural alternative medicine thing and then also too you know the pain management
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:53.680]   a winner used a stone so I went and looked for you know I approached it from a
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:00.320]   reeky standpoint where like okay what stones are associated with rest and sleep and turns out
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:06.560]   there's a celestite crystal that has the that emanates that that vibration so I used that
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.440]   natural thing from mother earth you know again as such oils from mother earth and then I went
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.640]   and looked at substances where I basically was like you know like what are the quote you know
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:22.240]   supplemental substances that are used throughout you know these different practices right and so
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:28.080]   of course chamomile magnolia bark which are very you know very popular and then I found some other
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.040]   ones that I had not been familiar with but they came up in my research when I was looking at how
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:39.360]   homeopaths approach calming and resting you know remedies and so it came out with these four
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:45.120]   different substances I won't try to butcher how to pronounce them of course then I looked at
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.760]   just regular old supplementation you know like what are the top you know I mean I looked at like
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.680]   what are the what are the supplements top supplements that and you know you get this giant list
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.400]   and I just kind of intuitively went through the list and those two popped out at me as being the
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:04.000]   ones that I should add again I did everything intuitively I really put my thinking brain aside
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.480]   and just went with my intuition on this one and then of course as I mentioned I put in water
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:17.280]   and deep sea salt now the water that I use is called mother water it is created using an anolema
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:26.000]   wand if you go and look at research that it's an incredible you know tool and puts out this
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.200]   incredible natural earth frequency of the natural frequency of water and it's called mother water
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:39.760]   once you use that wand so I use the frequency of mother water as as the water frequency and then
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:46.720]   as my salt frequency I use Kona deep sea salt now if you're not familiar with that sea salt there's
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.600]   all these different kinds of salts in the world but off the coast of Big Island in a state of
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   Hawaii they have you know they basically have a pipe that goes down thousands of feet right off
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:04.960]   the you know the coast and it goes straight into deep water and so it goes below just all the
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:10.400]   you know the surface water and it goes really super deep where the water is pristine and pure
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:16.640]   you know no microplastics no pollution it's down really deep and it brings up all that deep sea
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.040]   water and then they run it through their process and dry it out and they create and they produce
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.840]   the salt and so it's literally the pure salt you can find it's you know it hasn't been
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.640]   you know polluted or anything so and it's been tested it's all certified not you know no heavy
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:36.160]   metal so I wanted to use the purest salt I could find which I use Kona salt so that's kind of what
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:42.800]   I did and that's my list okay and so that was my submission and in first place so then Ralph first
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:48.000]   place he did his do and so it's real interesting Ralph's approach was he went with the central oil
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.280]   so he's got three different essential oils we both landed on lavender but he ended he ended up
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:59.520]   adding blue tancy and turmeric okay in terms of essential oils in his his mixture and then you
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:05.200]   can see when he got into substances there's tons and tons of substances I mean he's got a lot of
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.520]   substances real interesting list you know I won't go through each one individually but
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:16.160]   definitely he went in for the your typical supplements and he used melatonin I know melatonin is a
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:21.040]   sleep thing but I just had an intuitively sense that you know it's just you know don't you don't
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.440]   need it I didn't want to use it I just didn't feel good about using it so I didn't add it to my list
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:31.760]   and again too I wanted to keep my list short remember less is best but anyway he's got some
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.160]   things here I don't recognize and he's got some other things that I do but he's got lots of
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:42.400]   different supplements and substances that he put in he put in the entire magnesium scale of every
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:48.400]   single magnesium type out there now I only use magnesium glycinate because that is the one known
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:53.520]   for helping people sleep but he used them all which was interesting and he had you know basically
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.520]   oh this is a duplicate just noticed that and so then so basically he's using all these different
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.480]   you know substances and then of course he gets in the clodal gold which I thought was fascinating
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:10.160]   you know and not silver but clodal gold and gold so he's got three different golds in here
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.960]   again he's got the curcumin so he's got curcumin down here as a supplement and also the essential
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:20.000]   oil of curcumin which is cool turmeric right acerbic acid vitamin c sick b6 and he's got some
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.280]   vitamins in here so that's what he put in his and so his are purely you know like I like a while I
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:30.240]   have a brainwave in there and you know he stuck with just supplements you know which I think is
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.840]   real interesting and his his did really great I mean essential oils and all these supplements
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:41.200]   and substances seem to have done exceptional because he won first place as well so that's
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.600]   what's in it now for those of you again you can get a you can get a link to this you want to take
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.640]   a look at the list and then of course I've got this clod analysis on the back end so let me kind of
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:56.480]   talk about that again so again it's myself and Ralph put together is what is in the new common
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.680]   rest frequency and so what I do with the last video and then I do this one with this one one of
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.720]   the things about AI is it's exceptional one of its exceptional abilities is to just basically
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.880]   dig through information and summarize and make it simple for you and so that's kind of what I did
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:18.480]   so I fed this all into an AI called clod justice and I asked the AI hey if I kind of want to explain
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:24.640]   this to somebody you know what are the categories you know categorized this list of 45 different
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:30.240]   things categorize them and and tell me what the common properties are so that we can kind of get
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.720]   an idea of what's you know like what's like what are the recipe you know if you're putting together
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:40.080]   a recipe for a great frequency set what are the different things you need to think about
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.160]   that should all the ingredients that should go in there so this is the extract of that now it's
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.320]   going to be right here if you want to kind of take a look at this is going to be in the same handout
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.200]   where you can look at what the clod basically said where basically hey you've got essential oils
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.240]   and plant extracts magnesium compounds and then which one of those things fell into which one okay
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.640]   so it kind of really makes it simple but you know this is the little the short version of that
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:08.640]   list which is basically the categories of all of the things that went into this frequency set that
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:14.400]   won the contest was essentially you know looking at essential oils and plant extracts magnesium
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.920]   compounds which are obviously going to be primarily because it's about asleep but other ones you know
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.520]   you could look at if you're creating other frequency sets you'd want to look at other different
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.280]   compounds that would you know supplements versus substances right but then there were also
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.680]   neurotransmitters and neurological compounds again for you know because it's we're talking
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.680]   about the brain here but you know the vitamins is central nutrients right water all that the b6
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:42.240]   the b12 that Ralph put in his he put in minerals as well I put in minerals I put in salt
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:49.200]   bioactive compounds natural substances and derivatives we covered that medicinal plants again you know
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.320]   I've covered that that's what my stuff had in it was the homeopathic medicinal plants and then
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:59.520]   acids and chemical compounds which is what was very you know basically chemical compounds
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:04.240]   with specific molecular structures which Ralph had put in as part of his natural you know like
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.640]   basically if you look at his list he's got lots of different chemical compounds but you know these
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.400]   are basically the fancy words for substances or I mean supplements but that's kind of what's in
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.880]   here so you want to say hey you know how do I put together a frequency set that's going to be
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:24.160]   incredibly effective these are the categories of compounds and substances and things you want to
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:30.080]   try to keep in mind in your approach and so again you know my approach again was you know these six
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.880]   things we covered that but then when I asked Claudia hey give me a summary of findings like
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.200]   tick you know this whole this whole list what you know what you know what is what is the main
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:44.080]   points that you know the key points of the findings and basically Claude came back looking at the
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:49.920]   entire list of 45 unique things and said hey many substances are naturally derived like you know
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.720]   hey there you go right a several compounds focused on neurological because this was a frequency for
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.280]   the brain multiple forms of certain elements especially magnesium for different applications
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.000]   again and then Claude also noted that there was a mix of traditional and modern therapeutic
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.240]   compounds true I went really traditional Ralph kind of did both and then various bioavailable
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:15.120]   forms of sub similar substances right so the different forms meaning you know it was like
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.400]   available as an essential oil versus available as a substance versus available as you know a
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:26.240]   brainwave right but that was it and so there you go that's the new calm and rest frequency
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:31.200]   that's what's in it that's what kind of like categorizes you know this all the different things
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.040]   that are in it and and also more importantly like you know what do you need to think about
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:41.200]   when you are making your own because you know it's so important because the better we get at
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.560]   this can you imagine where we're going to be 10 years from now in our ability to heal and treat
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:53.680]   and help and support people pets plants and places when we get that good at creating frequency
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:58.080]   sets I mean that's just really where all this is going and that's and then you know thank you
