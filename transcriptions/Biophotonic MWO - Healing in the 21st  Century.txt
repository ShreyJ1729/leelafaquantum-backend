[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.320]   Kalmer and in this video I'd like to share with you a bioelectromagnetic healing device
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.960]   called the biophotonic multi-wave oscillator. It's essentially what I would think that if
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.520]   there's ever going to be medbed technology that this would be incorporated into that because this
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.680]   is clearly the concept of healing in the 21st century. So let me let me kind of just explain what
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.120]   I'm talking about because this is a phrase that I came up with because there's really no name
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.560]   for all of these different versions of the same thing. I mean they all have their own name that
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.880]   they've called their product you know all these different inventors that have come up with this
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:51.680]   but essentially though it's I see it as a class of device and it's biophotonic it's also a multi-wave
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.400]   oscillator that's the name I'm giving it. So this is my phrase okay so you're not going to find
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.520]   that out there in the public but that's what this really is. It's essentially a multi-wave oscillator
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.400]   that's emitting light. So in this video I'm going to just do like a high-level overview of the
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.680]   different devices that are out on the market and how they sort of are working and then get into
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.800]   the biological effects and then obviously if I can share with you whatever I can give you in
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.280]   terms of like you know what does this do? In other words number two would be you know what's
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.200]   it supposed to do? Number three would be what are the testimonials and the studies
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.760]   if any that basically validate or try to validate that you know the efficacy of these devices in
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.560]   terms of healing and also too you know lastly in the back of the video it's going to be if you
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.960]   want to experience one of these things then you know I go ahead and give you all the information
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.200]   you need so that if you wanted to try one there you know there's lots of different ways not lots
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.120]   of different ways but you know there are ways to go ahead and try one of these things. So now
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.600]   before I jump into the content I do want to kind of explain that right now there's only you know
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.880]   there's been several of these devices that have been created a couple of the companies have just
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.480]   kind of disappeared off their you know radar but right now of the four different devices that are
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.240]   most are that are actually out there for sale right now and for experiencing you've got this
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.200]   biocharger device and these are all the same technologies essentially there are obviously major
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.080]   differences and that's going to be discussing another video but there's a device called a
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.040]   biocharger there's one called the Tesla energy lights there's one called the quantum pulse and
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.200]   then there's the nova light now all of these devices have former names these are all the current names
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.240]   the most recent names given to the devices but each one of these have other names that they've
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.000]   been given in the past because you know as they evolve and get new features and so forth you know
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.160]   there's different names to them all so it does get really confusing trying to figure out you
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.600]   know what your device is what and who did what and how it works and all of that so this video is
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.280]   going to be let's talk about these devices as at a high level so that we can all kind of understand
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.240]   hey what are they you know what general in general terms executive summary hey let's you know like
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.960]   what do these things do and and what are people saying about them so now before I jump in that I
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.440]   just have some disclaimers I just want to make sure that all information contained in this video
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.120]   that you understand is for educational purposes only and should not be just you know construed as
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.800]   any type of medical advice all right so none of this stuff has ever been approved by the FDA
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.160]   or you know sanctioned by them or even there's no they haven't even been classified as medical
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.440]   devices you know so none of that FDA stuff applies here so just you know fair warning that this is
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.600]   just for educational purposes and also too I want to really make sure that you understand that I
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.480]   have no affiliation to any of the products here so I'm not an affiliate I'm not selling anything this
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.160]   is just purely information and you know for education and just sharing now also too that the
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.360]   information that is contained in this video is public okay so I've just basically spent my entire
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.800]   Christmas break for the last three weeks researching these devices and every single different device
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.160]   and the story behind all of them and the technology etc so it's all public information source from
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.320]   the web archives patent databases existing vendors websites and also on YouTube and
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.160]   I just want to convey you know convey that all of this material is presented under fair use now
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.160]   the last thing I really want to kind of say is that you know after three weeks of collecting
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.720]   information about these class of devices and the content in this in this discussion really kind of
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.520]   comes down to three actual separate conversations that I think are really valuable to have about these
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.840]   devices in general and so one of them is just you know what are the claims that are being made and
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.800]   that's this video this video is about you know hey what are people what are the people who created
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.120]   these things say about them and so forth and so what are the claims that have been made and I think
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.320]   that's the where I want to start this conversation the next two discussions that I think are important
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.400]   to have and these will be in future videos is an actual review of the technology kind of comparing
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.520]   the devices to each other comparing them to the original multi-wave oscillator and just there's a
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.080]   lot of technology involved and especially a lot of technology that involves the you know like what
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.720]   is the output of this machine and how is it working and and how is it doing some of the things that
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.080]   these claims are saying that they're doing I mean it's in a fascinating area and you know I wouldn't
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.640]   be able to have a you know a short video if I tried to include that so that's going to be a
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.680]   separate video of course now there's the third piece here is the clinical validation now none
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.840]   of the vendors who have created these invented them and put them out on the market they've done you
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.240]   know there are no NIH level you know pseudo sham you know placebo type you know control group type
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.760]   studies that have been done on any of these machines in terms of use on humans or pets
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.920]   animals and so forth everything is just simply testimonial and claims by the vendors and so
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.800]   there's been no third party independent review except for one there's been a couple of studies
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.800]   that have been done by third parties on one of the machines that was done quite a long time ago
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.760]   and I'll share that in the video as well but they're not like NIH level studies so there's really been
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.760]   no third party peer review and I just want to stipulate that as well it's part of that whole
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.800]   idea about you know don't construed as medical advice it hasn't fallen under any of that
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.680]   kind of stuff that you would expect you know like you like just say like you know like other
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.320]   type of devices out there that are actually classified as medical devices other devices out
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.880]   there have like lots of you know peer reviewed studies that show that they do what they do you
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.040]   know like red light therapy for example so anyway so I just wanted to make sure that you understand
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.040]   that there's three conversations here that I think are really important to kind of really
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.920]   truly understand this technology and this one is this first video you're watching right now is
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.760]   the claims made video so let's jump right in now what is a biophotonic multi-wave oscillator and
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.600]   so there's a little history here I think that's important for everyone to understand is that it
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.280]   is literally the next generation of an original multi-wave oscillator that was invented by a
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:14.080]   gentleman whose name is Georges Lacoskey and this patent came out in 1934 and his device that he
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:20.160]   put on the market he commercializes patent and it's called the colosa now the colosa kind of was
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.120]   put out there was basically part of the medical establishment it was really big in Europe and there
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.160]   was and it was introduced in the early 40s to the American market and of course World War II
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.520]   you know totally shut that down and you know the world changed for a few years and so it just
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.920]   kind of disappeared after World War II but the whole idea though is that Lacoskey theorized and he
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.120]   was the very first one to come up with this you know it predecessor is Nikola Tesla who created
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.920]   these coils and they've kind of like kind of collaborated with each other and he put together
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:58.160]   this healing machine because in his theory his theory was really kind of simple if you think about
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:04.800]   it basically he was thinking and theorizing that all of the cells of our body have you know have
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:11.600]   a resonant frequency that we operate on and if you think of like a you know like a piano or a guitar
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   and you know every single string or every single key of the device you know resonates at a specific
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.400]   tone right and and and then you know once it comes out of you know when it comes out of tune
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:28.240]   eventually over usage and over time you know like you know and your guitars out of tune for example
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.480]   so you have to have someone tune it or you tune it yourself you're using tuning forks whatever
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.920]   but the whole idea though is once it once that each one of those strings or each one of the keys
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:44.320]   on a piano becomes out of tune then it doesn't sound right it just doesn't play right it's no
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:50.320]   longer at you know pitch perfect right so there's the concept of you know how a device or how a
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.480]   cell or a string or a key in the world of resonant frequencies and audio sound there's the idea of
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.400]   pitch perfect you know what is it what does it mean to be pitch perfect and that means it's in
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.520]   its natural state and it's resonating perfectly and it's operating exactly like how you know the
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:11.360]   universe created it to be you know and and and operate right but once it becomes out of tune
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.720]   then Likovsky's idea was and his theory was as well if we could find a way to tune
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:23.520]   your cells back to its natural healthy you know basically perfect pitch state
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.200]   then in that perfect pitch state what is the you know environment well the environment of a
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.440]   perfect pitch resonating you know resonating cell and there's trillions of cells in each one of us
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.320]   and there's all sorts of different kinds of cells from blood cells to cells that make up
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.560]   your kidneys and liver and brain and I mean there's so many different cells right and there's
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.880]   trillions of them and so what would happen if you could create a device that would tune
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.680]   the human body just like you would tune a guitar or tune a piano or a cello or so forth right and
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.840]   so that's what he set out to do and so he kind of basically was like well you know his idea was
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.400]   well you know I can't figure out and there's no way back in the you know turn of the century
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.760]   literally a hundred years ago there was no way for Likovsky to find out what was the exact
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.560]   frequency of every single type of cell right and so what he did was he kind of took the shotgun
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:23.200]   approach and he created a you know a pulse modulator that's what this device is it's the power supply
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:31.120]   and it also puts out a pulse okay and an oscillating pulse that using kind of like old school technology
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:37.360]   using something called a spark gap which is like two little metal rods that are a distance apart
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.560]   you run high current through the rod the rods and it creates a little arc a little lightning bolt
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.920]   between the two of them and that little lightning bolt is what pulses right it just keeps it you
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:54.160]   know like kind of like that and then as that really and then it then it also uses a step up process
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:59.760]   where the voltage is stepped up from coming out of the wall as you know our you know in America
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:06.640]   the voltage coming out of your wall is 110 volts in Europe it's 220 but there it's not really high
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.760]   I mean not really high in the world of high voltage right and so it takes that 110 volts and it steps
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:19.680]   it up to a little over 50 thousand to 600 thousand volts are coming out of this machine and it's coming
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.840]   out at a pulse because of the spark gap ran through the Tesla coils and then what creates
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.960]   the frequency are these incredible antennas that he came up with which are essentially based on
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.840]   the golden mean and so he created these copper antennas and he connected them to these coils
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:42.720]   and then what would happen is if you sat in between these coils you would experience this pulse
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:49.200]   high voltage pulsing you know electrical field that was resonating every single frequency
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:56.240]   that was the you know the entire scale because the frequencies were generated by the electricity
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:02.800]   the arcing of the electricity as it passed through these these antennas okay so I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.640]   I'm trying to just explain this this is my elevator explanation of what a multi wave oscillator does
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:15.120]   and that's where you would get this pulsed electromagnetic frequency that was essentially
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:22.960]   a device that would tune the human body to back to pitch perfect and so what happened was it
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:28.960]   actually worked and so now I did an entire video about George's Lacoskey's multi wave oscillator
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:34.960]   link in the video description below where it talks in great detail about this machine and especially
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.680]   the biological effects that they discovered when they started using it in medical clinics throughout
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:45.600]   Europe and when they brought it to America and what it did was it resolved whatever issue people
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:53.040]   had it would actually do what Lacoskey theorized it would do once you get tuned like a guitar you
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:59.040]   play at perfect pitch and a perfect pitch cell does not have any disease or anything wrong with it
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.320]   so keep that in mind so it's kind of like you know he invented this a hundred years ago so since the
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:10.400]   30s and especially after the 40s when World War II kind of just changed the world this machine
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.880]   kind of went into hiding and so then it kind of just disappeared off the radar in terms of like
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.480]   healing modalities and being used in medical clinics and so forth it just literally disappeared
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:26.080]   after World War II but the story goes now what happened was was this and then all is a credit
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:31.840]   to a guy named James Gerard who is the one of the founders who is the founder of the biocharger
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.520]   model you know it's a company and it's also a device so he came up with no James Gerard
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.240]   in the late 80s started tinkering around saying hey you know about with about you know with the
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.680]   Lacoskey multi wave oscillator as his inspiration and he created something called the biocharger
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.560]   and so now I like again I'm classifying this multi wave oscillator as a biophotonic
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:59.600]   you know MWO multi wave oscillator because of the fact that instead of these two rings creating
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.440]   the frequencies he has the same idea where the base unit is your pulse modulator and then using
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.480]   spark now the original ones that he created used a spark gap it created that high intensity
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.320]   high voltage and it when it came up here though this section up here is the antenna and the antenna
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:23.040]   instead of using copper coils he's used he decided to use what we would call a spectrum tube that's
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.320]   filled with different types of gases and essentially he wanted he used the noble gases there's eight
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:36.880]   six of the noble gases that he uses in his machine to simulate the atmospheric conditions of our
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:42.880]   planet and so in in his way of approaching it once you pulse that electrical current or that
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:48.480]   electrical voltage through these spectrum tubes then the output instead of it being this really
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.440]   high charge electrical field with frequency you know the scale the up and down scale of the frequency
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.560]   constantly pulsing and modulating and oscillating then what this would do what this device would do
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:06.320]   is is the same thing that's the theory but instead it would use light it would use photons to and
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.320]   the electrical field as the carrier wave to then pulse those bio photons through you and then the
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.120]   gases would be what would create the different frequencies and it would also be up and down
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:23.200]   the scale and so it's just a different way to approach the same goal which is creating a healing
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.920]   machine that would tune the body back to pitch perfect and so this this this device was created
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:36.800]   in 1988 now since then this device has been on the market the biocharger was the first one by
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:42.640]   James Gerard who's now formed a company called Applied Technologies and so now the patents that
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:47.120]   have been put out there now if you search the patent database there's I found essentially four
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:52.240]   patents based that would kind of wrap around the idea of what I've described to you now the first
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:57.760]   one as I mentioned was Georges Glasky and he filed a patent in France and it basically was filed
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:03.600]   on June 12 1934 so since then when we're talking about and that was the original Likovsky so we
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.480]   call that the Likovsky multi-wave oscillator now for these other devices that I'm calling the
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:13.440]   biophotonic multi-wave oscillator the patents came out there was a patent that came out
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.120]   by a gentleman called Jean Coons who is the the the founder and inventor of the device
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:25.440]   the original device name was called the Vibe Machine it's now called Quantum Pulse okay and so
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:33.040]   this Quantum Pulse device he filed two patents on it one in August 23rd of 2005 and he filed
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:39.760]   another one September 1st 2009 so it's kind of odd because when you look at the fourth patent on
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:46.000]   the multi-wave oscillator it's filed it's actually was filed by James Gerard which is also applied
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.440]   technologies and he filed a patent on the you know for the biocharger but he filed it just this
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:59.120]   last year in March 30 2003 so you know the chronology of the of the development of the device goes
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.120]   from Likovsky to Gerard but it's interesting I find it's just a weird thing where the chronology
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:11.840]   of the patent filings actually skipped Gerard and actually Gene kind of slid in there and got
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:17.520]   got his patents filed but then you know you know James actually filed in 2003 so these are the
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.880]   different patents that exist and now when you read the different patents I think one of the you
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:28.160]   know it's kind of like the best one I could find to kind of explain the technology and I'm only
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.440]   going to do this at a super high level I don't you know because this is not a
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.000]   technology discussion this is like the executive summary but I do want to explain so I'm going to
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.400]   take I think when I read all of these I think this one or this one right here the patent number
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:46.880]   seven five eight three one seven two kind of has a description in the patent that I think is probably
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:52.240]   the closest thing to you know keeping it in layman's terms and and simplicity as to like what is
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.560]   this really you know what does this do from a technology standpoint so this is a snapshot out
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.560]   of that out of that patent now let me just kind of read to you why you kind of talk while I talk
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:05.440]   about or may just read you the description in the patent so the description of what this device is
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:10.640]   it's called a multi-frequency electromagnetic field generator okay that's the name of the patent
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.520]   and what it is it's disclosed is the multi-frequency electromagnetic field generator that is capable
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:21.280]   of generating electromagnetic flux fields that are projected at a distance from the device
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.960]   radial fields horizontal fields and spiral fields are generated by the electromagnetic field generator
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.840]   and are projected at a distance from the device a wide range of frequencies is generated as a
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:38.640]   result of the fast rise time pulses produced by the device the geometry and structure of the device
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.840]   cause the electromagnetic fields to encircle the device and be collected at the far end of the device
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:49.520]   by the antenna an inner coil antenna that is centrally disposed in the device receives
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.960]   electromagnetic waves that are transformed into a current that is applied to an inner coil
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.840]   the inner coil produces a strong electromagnetic field that extends outwardly in a horizontal
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.800]   direction that increases the projected horizontal distance of the electromagnetic field
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:12.160]   yeah okay so that's that's layman term but the point that I want to make by reading that
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.320]   is that it's not just oh you know let's just pump out some electricity and create a bubble field
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:21.760]   no the way that these things are designed is they are spinning and creating longitudinal
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:27.120]   waves of electricity it's not just a bubble you know like you know any other type of electrical
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.760]   device is essentially just you know it's radiated outwards and it's kind of like a bubble if you
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:37.120]   were to think of it a field but this one is spinning the electricity so like essentially
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:42.960]   the power is coming out of the box it out of the spark gap spark gap you know oscillating circuit
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.440]   and then this high voltage pulsed electricity is then coming through the coil
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.080]   and because of the way that it's designed it's spinning it it's spinning that field
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.880]   in multiple directions and then when it hits this very top section here this little thing here
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:02.560]   which I can kind of show you like here on the biocharger this top coil is called a mobius coil
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.320]   and there's some discussion out there that's like what kind of field is created when you when
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.280]   you wrap wire like that and so what's really happening is it creates a longitudinal field
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.880]   and it also in some people actually think it creates an energy vortex when you pump
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.360]   you know electricity through one of these fields so what you've got essentially is an
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.320]   electromagnetic field that's just twisting and turning and spinning and then it's projecting
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.080]   frequencies into that field and that's what makes this really kind of unique it's
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.000]   way different than if you were to just walk up to a power line and experience electrical fields
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.360]   right from an EMF standpoint and that's the point is because when you basically experience high
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:46.160]   voltage in this type of an electrical magnetic environment it is found to be good for you as
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:51.440]   opposed to walking up to a power line which is found to be bad for you so because of the way that
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.960]   this works it's actually quite different and very different in terms of like you know EMF like
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:02.800]   what's good EMF and what's bad EMF well this is apparently good EMF so now this is a copy on the
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:09.120]   right side here of the actual antenna there's 12 different tubes filled with different gases
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.360]   in the antenna and then on top of this stands the Mobius coil okay it's not pictured here in this
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.120]   diagram but it's over here right here if you look at this little tiny thing now I went and took a
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:22.480]   look at what types of gases are being used I couldn't get any specifications on the Vibe machine
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.040]   itself but I do have a novel light I have like one of these this is the one I have right here on
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:34.800]   the right it's the novel light as part of the research for this video I discovered a really great
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:40.560]   deal on one of these it's a used one because the company is now defunct but I got I just you know
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:46.160]   the stars lined up for me and I was able to go ahead and get one of these things so I found
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:54.320]   a used one on eBay and you know I you know just to kind of convey my dedication to my my level of
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:01.040]   interest and just absolutely I'm just fascinated by biological magnetics in general but I found
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:07.280]   this thing on eBay and it was pick up only I drove during the Christmas break I took three days
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:14.400]   packed up the dogs and I drove from my home in Missouri all the way to Colorado to pick it up
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:20.640]   it was 1,500 miles over three days to go ahead and acquire this this device and now it's set up
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.440]   in my living room and I'm using it so it's quite an adventure you know as part of making this video
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:32.000]   in terms of I wanted to get one after I did all this research I'm like I want to get one really
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.480]   badly and so I did but anyway so what I'm trying to say is that when I was able to contact the
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:43.600]   folks at biocharger and by the way those guys are so friendly and so helpful and so I contacted
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   the biocharger folks and I'm like hey what's in those you know what what are the what are the
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:53.520]   gases that you guys are using and so they basically said hey we're using six of the eight noble gases
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:00.160]   argon helium krypton mercury neon and zion and so they use there's 12 tubes right so there's two
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:06.320]   of each one of these gases in the biocharger okay now my nova light that I got now that one has
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:14.080]   these six different noble gases but it also contains carbon dioxide nitrogen and oxygen so I've
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:19.200]   got like six plus three I got nine different gases in the nova light and yes so what are the
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.360]   other three and I believe and I can't confirm this because there's nobody around to explain it to
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:28.640]   me but I believe the other three are just duplicates of some of these gases and I'm trying to figure
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.880]   that out right now but you know it's just one of my things about the whole technology review is
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:38.720]   like I've got a lot of work to do in the future to really understand like does this thing do what
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.520]   it says it's gonna do you know does it meet then and what are exactly is the field sizes and things
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:50.560]   like that to give you an example the vibe machine says the field is six to eight feet so the recommended
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.280]   you know user is supposed to sit like three feet close to it so that you're closest to the fields
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:00.480]   you're getting the you know the bulk of the of the frequencies and so forth so field sizes
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:05.360]   you know pulse rates how many watts it's pulling all that stuff will be in the next video but
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:10.720]   that's what the the different gases that are being used now the claim obviously right is that when
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:16.240]   you pass a high voltage high voltage electricity through these gases it's going to create that
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:22.480]   frequency spread that lacoskey discovered coming through coil you know actual copper coils but
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.320]   instead they'll be coming through these gases and that's sort of how that that's you know that's
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.600]   sort of in a nutshell how it works so let me kind of give you a little demo the first notes that I
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:37.200]   took two different clips the first one is my is the novel light that I acquired a couple of weeks
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:44.400]   ago from that guy in in Colorado and shout out to you because I made a new friend it's it was fun
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:49.760]   to meet somebody who's excited about bioelectro magnetics as I am I've been really passionate
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.320]   about this for like 20 years and so is he so you know so it was great to meet it as someone who's
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.600]   like a part of the tribe you know so anyway so I got my nova light and so here's a there's a clip
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.920]   I'm about to show you to kind of demo what these things look like when they're turned on
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:11.120]   the first one is the nova light 3000 that I own and the second one is is the actual biocharger
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.200]   that is you know what that was created by James Gerard and the individual in the video is Luke's
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.720]   story and they did a video together about the biocharger it's a great video link in the video
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:28.880]   description where he demonstrates how the biocharger looks and sounds while it's turned on so let me
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:50.720]   go ahead and just start that for you okay well let's see if I can get the here we go
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:07.280]   it goes down now all of the different colors are the different gases
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:14.160]   and if you get really close to that movie as well if you look close enough you'll see that
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:20.640]   there's art coming off of that movie as well here's the biocharger and Luke's story now you'll
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:26.320]   notice that biocharger was far enough to put a case around the antennas you don't shaft here
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:32.800]   so and they also in case the movie is well for probably the same reason but if you look at the
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.280]   very top right here there's there's a little rod that comes out of the top that actually
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:42.480]   discharges the little you know the basically the arcing and now I do want to point out that while
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.560]   this thing is running because it's arcing there's little you know lightning bolts coming off of it
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.280]   it is creating negative ions and it's creating ozone but you know when you run it for like three
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:57.040]   minutes or something like that the ozone accumulation is not so heavy but I'm not sure how the ozone
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.840]   accumulation around a biocharger is I don't have one I haven't been able to well I haven't experienced
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:07.600]   one just quite yet but but that's this that's what these devices do look like that's what they look
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:14.080]   like and sound like and the other thing to know about them is you know they're loud they're not
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:20.640]   quiet machines and they do produce a smell so so in a nutshell okay let's talk about about you
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.440]   know what's really happening here from a biological effect standpoint so what I want to say is like
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.680]   here's an example of the biocharger and so one of the first things I want to say is what's coming
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:34.560]   out of this machine and how it affects you biologically is the first thing again is the pulse
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:40.800]   electromagnetic frequency the PEMF now Lakovsky talked about using a broad bandwidth so that the
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:46.880]   cells with very weak vibrations when placed in the field of multiple vibrations find their own
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:53.120]   frequency and start again to oscillate normally through the phenomenon of resonance unquote and
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:57.600]   that's kind of what's going on and so that's kind of what's creating this healing magic now the other
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:03.120]   thing too about these high voltage it's it's healthy high voltage now one of the things about
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:09.040]   high voltage EMF exposure it is extremely beneficial like a quick cold shower when you wake up
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:15.440]   whereas long-term exposure stimulates the body's immune system too much so short-term high voltage
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:22.000]   therapy increases the transmembrane potential TMP enhances the sodium potassium pump for your
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.400]   cells to communicate and to you know essentially you know detox and also increases ATP production
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.520]   so that boosts your energy it kills pathogens that's what's key here and infections so that's
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:39.840]   like it's doing a blood electrification act action at the same time and overall improve cell metabolism
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.280]   and energy levels and I can testify to that just to let you know I've been using my Novolite for a
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:49.920]   week now I use it three minutes a day and then one of the first things I realized not to do
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:57.120]   is don't do this at night because every single time I use it after six I'm only sleeping two to
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.800]   three hours at night I just automatically wake up and I'm wide awake full of energy like I just
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.000]   had a full night sleep it's bizarre so I'm learning now just to turn that you only use that thing in
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.800]   the morning because it's really quite disruptive to my circadian rhythm now the other thing that's
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:16.560]   going on is the biophotons and that's what this key thing here is light and that's what makes this
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:22.720]   device so unique and different than the Likovsky multi-wave oscillator again that used coils so now
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:28.240]   in terms of biophotons or light and that's what makes this so special is that your body can be
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.880]   thought of as a coherent biophotonic field of energy and information and when this field starts
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:38.240]   to break down the body becomes sick and weak right so now biophotons like enzymes provide the
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:44.240]   activation energy needed for biochemical reactions to take place in your body the gas tube emission
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:49.600]   spectra from the tubes provides a richer and more precise array of laser-like and highly
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:55.280]   ordered photons that strengthen and energize your body's natural field all right so that's
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:00.160]   kind of the whole description of what biophotons do and you know and one of the other things the
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:08.720]   to me the you know the esoteric idea of of what also biophotons and how they're important to us
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:13.840]   is that you know you if you talk to energy workers you know we are considered beings of light
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:20.800]   and there's this really interesting thing about light that I find that is equally as
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:27.760]   interesting about water which kind of folds into the concepts of reality and and you know what we
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:33.920]   perceive as reality and I think that in the future like again as I first stated if there's ever gonna
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:41.600]   be medbed technology it's gonna have a lot to do with manipulating light and water because we are
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.640]   water and we are light you know as physical beings okay then the last thing again is those
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.920]   frequencies and those harmonics that are coming out of that pulsed electromagnetic you know pulse
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.520]   that's coming out to the frequencies and there's that one other thing that's happening too and I
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.080]   just kind of want point out this thing pumps out ozone right so you're being you're smelling it
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.320]   but at the same time though it's pumping out negative ions and if you ever look into negative
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:09.680]   ions you know it's the reason that negative ions are found in nature and especially like you know
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:15.600]   after a storm you know after or close to the any kind of moving water and it's like you know
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:22.000]   why are people so attracted you know to going to the beach well that's because the beach environment
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.440]   is full of negative ions and negative ions are super healthy for us it's basically nature's
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.720]   gift to us in the form of free electrons and electrons are the opposite of the things that
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:38.240]   all causes problems right so that's one of the most that's why this device and this class of
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   devices are pumping out so much wonderful stuff that it's really quite amazing in terms of like
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:48.800]   you know what it's actually producing so now how you use it again you know basically you can sit
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.960]   there and you can expose yourself just by yourself but you're also going to do group you know this
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:58.400]   thing is so strong that you can have up to six people surrounding the machine the biocharger
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:04.480]   is recommended to use it for 12 to 15 as I mentioned the novolite and the vibe machine i.e. the quantum
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:11.440]   pulse you use it for three minutes at a time you know so devices vary in terms of you know usage
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:16.080]   and user guides but you know the whole idea though is you can expose you can expose yourself in
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:23.520]   individually or in groups for a period of time okay so that's kind of how the device works
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:29.280]   how it's designed and what it produces now let's talk about the testimonials now this is the actual
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.560]   what have people experience and what have they you know what are the manufacturers saying about
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:40.560]   hey you know what happens when you use this thing well i want to first start off with now this is
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:46.400]   jean coonsies the inventor of the vibe machine which is now called again the quantum pulse machine
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:52.880]   and his story is really kind of unique in the group of gentlemen that put together these devices
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:33:00.400]   post-likovsky because jean created a vibe machine and he kind of ran afoul of the fda so you know
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:08.320]   this is a like he gave a lecture in 2005 but by 2007 the fda kind of got on his ochole about the
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:13.360]   claims he was making through his testimonials he was giving that were published on his website so
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:20.560]   what happened was is after the fda basically got on him about what he was claiming to have done
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:28.400]   they shut him down and so after 2007 the original vibe machine website was gone he went kind of
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:34.400]   underground and disappeared for a while because you know he just completely just basically did the
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:39.440]   big no-no you should not you know this is we all know right it's very dangerous to cure cancer
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:47.040]   you know as as an example and so you know so he just ran afoul of the authorities that protect the
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.440]   you know the pharmaceutical industry so and the medical establishment and so he disappeared and he
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:58.000]   earned the star award of the alternative medicine world which is he got his own page on quack watch
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.600]   and it's and here's the thing nothing had to do with the fact that anyone got injured or that
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:10.800]   they went to this thing and they were there was no complaints from anyone who had exposed themselves
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:16.560]   to this device you know none of the people using it you know were were the reason it was simply
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.520]   because he was basically saying things that you know the medical establishment does not want him to
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:27.760]   say and so he disappeared but he came back and that's where the quantum pulse you know you know
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:34.160]   device i.e it's essentially the vibe machine but it's now called the quantum pulse it's no longer
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:40.960]   for sale you know you can't just go and buy the device from him but you know if you contact them
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:46.640]   directly yeah yeah you can go get one but now it's more of a instead of selling a device to the
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:52.000]   to practitioners and the public now it's more like hey you know the the website that he's got up
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.760]   it's like hey this is this great technology extremely vague very you know not a lot of detail
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:02.960]   for obvious reasons after what happened and it but it's basically like here's all the people that
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:08.160]   offer sessions and so now it's more like go to go to that website to find people who have the
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:14.000]   device so you can go and get an experience from it in the old days when the vibe machine was actually
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.640]   out there their practitioners their sales were about 60 percent of their sales went to practitioners
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:26.080]   everyone from chiropractors to veterinarians were using these machines 40 percent of their sales
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:30.960]   went to the general public for personal use and so that 60 percent you know they were basically
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:35.360]   called vibe centers and people would go to the vibe centers and and and take treatments off of the
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:41.680]   vibe machine and so now so that same concept still in play now now it's called the quantum pulse
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.480]   you go find someone who has a quantum pulse you know they're providing sessions for it and
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:51.360]   you can go to their website and and find someone who's doing that in your state or in your area you
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.920]   know so that's kind of how that evolved but I can tell you that if you look at anybody else's
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.640]   websites or you try to get any information about hey what is this thing to do what you know what
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:05.440]   are people saying about it it's completely scrubbed off the web now and the only place it lives is in
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:11.360]   in is in the internet archives on the old web on the old on the old well actually on the old site
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:19.360]   but it's also in this one video that he did this he did a lecture in 2005 it is on youtube and this
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:24.000]   is where I got this information which is where he was basically explaining hey this is what people
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.720]   are saying so let me run through with you what people had experienced and this is directly from
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.120]   jean coons these are the testimonials of people who had used the vibe machine back in the day
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:40.320]   so one of the first things was it it just dissolves calcium buildup in your in your in your bones
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:45.920]   in your body whether there's a patient who had breast cancer tumors that that person used the
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:51.440]   device for three and a half minutes per day for 30 days and then after another 30 days the cancer
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.480]   was gone someone also had another individual had brain cancer and they used the device for two
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.920]   minutes a day for five days cancer gone they were told that they had two months to live they lived
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:08.000]   a year past that point you know so it's not the panacea but they lived a year past that point
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.440]   and he wasn't he didn't explain you know what happened it you know individuals reporting increased
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:19.520]   in energy individuals reporting that they were on insulin for 10 years they did they used the
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:24.320]   vibe machine for daily for three months and they no longer needed to use insulin and they weren't
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:30.480]   using it anymore another individual is taking 17 different pharmaceutical you know products a day
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.200]   they used the machine for three months and they completely came off pharmaceuticals 100 percent
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:40.800]   this individual is on on oxygen they used the device for four months daily and they came they
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:46.560]   came off oxygen no longer needed it he also reported the people had said that they had seen
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:52.160]   improvements and or the disappearance of everything for multiple sclerosis Parkinson's lupus
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:38:00.000]   osteoarthritis and improvements in eyesight now he goes on in his video to say that people had
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.520]   great improvements in cataracts and eye floaters tendinitis migraines especially migraines it just
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:11.520]   eliminates them pain management reduces reliance on again on pharmaceuticals improvements in blood
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:16.640]   pressure improvements in broad sugar and also they had one autistic child use the machine after
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.240]   four or five sessions and the autistic child started talking and stuff like that you know
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:25.920]   improved uh issue it showed a 40 percent reduction time for wound healing uh it was improved the
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:30.640]   recovery time for stroke victims everyone here used it their mood improved there was this real
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:36.240]   interesting side effect you know where everyone anyone who had a depression they popped right
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:42.800]   at a depression being exposed to the vibe machine and then for pets he actually has uh i believe in
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:47.920]   one of his videos he actually has a picture of a dog with a huge tumor on it now the dog used the
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:54.080]   you know had the dog used the the vibe machine for two minutes per day for two weeks and you can see
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:59.840]   the picture where the actual tumor has shrunk considerably and so it's pretty interesting now
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:04.880]   unfortunately you know you you can't find this information anywhere else anymore like i said
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:11.200]   it's been scrub but this is what's what he got him in trouble with the FDA and so that's kind of what
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:16.800]   the vibe machine is known to have done back in the day and so now the other thing to like i did
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:21.920]   mention earlier is that there were clinical studies so if you go back into web archives
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:27.600]   and you find his old website that no longer exists today then he had actually posted three that he
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:32.640]   was actually in the process of doing clinical studies on his device because you know just like
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.800]   any other inventor you know you want to back up your claims and so he'd done
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:42.640]   and you know commissioned three different studies on that old website and so luckily
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.640]   there's two of them are still available there's a third one on depression that's just not available
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:50.880]   anymore i couldn't get ahold of it it's not in the public record but the one on pilot that
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:57.520]   he did a pilot study on on anti-aging conducted at the Holos University by Dr. Ginger Bowler
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.560]   and Dr. Norman Shealy back in December of 2005 now i'm not sure if you if you're in the alt
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:08.000]   medicine world you might know who Dr. Shealy is he's very prominent i followed him for years and years
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.040]   followed his work and so when i saw his name i was like oh this is legit so now this study now
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.400]   and they're just write-ups so they're not even like published peer review studies they're just
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:22.240]   like a write-up and so in that write-up of the pilot study on anti-aging basically they tested i
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:26.640]   think 14 individuals who took questionnaires and documented all of the things that they were
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.800]   having trouble with it's kind of like that little questionnaire you get when you show up at your
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.720]   doctors if you haven't been around for a long time they got this big question in air that you know
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:39.120]   you checkbox all the things that are you know troubling you you have problems with high blood
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:44.480]   pressure whatever and so they get they took those and so out of the number of you know there's like
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:52.240]   hundred number a hundred plus number of total issues that these 14 people had and then they had them
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:57.280]   use the vibe machine for a while and then they had them redo the study you know redo the questionnaire
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:02.080]   and then they had shown that they're after using the vibe machine that there was a reduction of
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:09.280]   53 percent in the number of people number of problems that people were reporting as having issues
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:16.720]   with so it showed a 53 reduction right in problematic issues that people had by using the vibe machine
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:23.280]   so I thought very interesting because Norman Sheely is a very reputable scientist now he there's also
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.840]   another study that's on that old website called clinical study on direct correlations between
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:33.600]   psychotronic and biochemical measures of human DNA now that's just like it's two literally two
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:39.760]   paragraphs and I honestly don't understand it it's like it's just way past my pay grade it talks
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:46.000]   about DNA unwinding and blah blah blah so I can't tell if it's good or bad there's no clear abstract
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.800]   or conclusions so I don't know what this whole study was about but it is out there on that old
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.880]   website link in the video description below and again there was that depression study now we know
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:42:00.160]   that the depression study even though it's unavailable we know by his by Gene Kuntz's testimony in his
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:05.840]   video that you know that it did improve mood and people were walking away with depression cured so
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.760]   that was kind of the interesting thing that I found in terms of like hey what are the you know
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.600]   what are the testimonies what are the clinical studies on this device and so that's kind of that
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:19.760]   so you know when you read all of that you can't help but go wow that's pretty pretty wild I mean
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:25.760]   they're just claims they haven't been quote validated but it's pretty amazing and so I do
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:30.320]   want to add on one last thing was that I've been discussing this video that I'm trying to make
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:36.480]   I've been working on for three weeks in our telegram chat group and you know with some of the
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.960]   people in there that are really really versed on multi-wave oscillators and one person jumped in
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:46.400]   like two nights ago and said hey I have I have the biocharger and I did and I did this you know
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:52.560]   this and this with me and then my son and and the testimony from that individual that was posted in
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:59.280]   telegram was straight on par with all of these incredible claims made by Gene Kuntz so when she
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.920]   came in and said or he I'm sorry you know made that claim of like hey I have a biocharger and this
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:09.360]   is what it did for us you know meaning I used a biophotonic multi-wave oscillator and it was
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:14.000]   beyond remarkable her personal testimony of somebody that I've kind of known about they've
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.680]   been hanging around telegram with us for quite a while and so this was like wow really that is so
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:24.080]   cool so there's a lot of you know there's I have you know there's well there's smoke there's fire
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:28.720]   and there's so I'm just feeling really positive about like hey some of these claims you know they
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:35.280]   might be true so hopefully we'll be able to get a lot more definitive about the specifics of what's
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:40.400]   happening when you use these things but I'm telling you that the stories from people who are using it
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:47.600]   are beyond amazing again this is medbed technology I mean this is magic you know kind of thing and
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:52.000]   you know obviously it's quantum healing too so we'll get into that in that other video so that's
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.600]   the case studies and the clinical studies and the last thing I want to kind of share with you are
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:44:00.560]   some notes about these machines before I get into the last piece of the video and that's that you
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:05.200]   know when you hear jean coons talk about the Vibe machine again now called quantum pulse you
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.960]   know he basically wanted to make sure everyone was really clear and so I really appreciate that
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:14.160]   this guy said these things about his own device when he said hey does not work on everyone all
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:20.560]   right so here let's level set it's not the magical miracle you know cure and so he you know quantified
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:26.560]   that his device had incredible results but it didn't work on everybody but it helps the majority
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:31.600]   people who used it now some people they actually felt slight tingling in their problem areas
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:37.680]   when exposed to the machine and others others that that he kind of kind of kept in touch with
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:42.480]   really kind of over time he had discovered that you know the you've got to improve your
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:48.320]   environmental situation for the results to remain and so by that you know and it's typical with
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.960]   any other type of treatment modality is that you know if you're an alcoholic and you go to rehab
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:58.640]   and you're cured well you need to not keep you know you need to improve your environmental situation
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:03.520]   in other words don't go back to drinking you know or if you're if you're eating toxic food all
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:08.000]   the time and you've got IBS and all these gut problems and then you know you go to a homeopath
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.280]   and they fix your gut microbiome and you're doing great you're and you know you can't go back to
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:17.920]   eating the poison food right so so that's just a clear reminder to everyone that hey you know all
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.720]   of these things are just amazing devices amazing healing modalities but if you don't change your
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:28.480]   environment you know the results will not remain for no matter what you do you know you need if you
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:33.920]   want it if you want it to be lasting you need to change your environment and lastly I think the
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:41.920]   key thing here is as of 2005 according to Gene Coons 50,000 people roughly you know roughly had
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:48.560]   used the vibe machine and there had been not one of 50,000 people now this is not just him
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:52.720]   it's all of the other vibe centers right there's they remember the vibe centers right so of all
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:46:00.160]   of the different users of 50,000 people as of 2005 no reported adverse side effects nobody had a
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:06.640]   problem with it not one complaint out of 50,000 users and that was his claim pretty amazing okay
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:14.000]   now now if you look at if you listen to the there's a really great Luke's story podcast with James
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.920]   Gerard and his and his two partners I believe it's Jim Law and Colin Besser I'm sorry if I got it
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:26.400]   wrong you know of applied technology which is also the biocharger NG NG stands for next generation
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:31.200]   it's the most recent model I believe it's like model three right now but if you listen to that
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:36.160]   video link in the video description then you know one of the things that really really is amazing
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:41.120]   about what James Gerard has done is now all of these other devices out there on the market so I'm
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:46.240]   going to go back to this picture here there's four devices currently on the market only two of them
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:51.200]   are still out there you know the companies exist and the companies are selling the other two are
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:57.280]   out there but you're only ever going to find a used version okay so now James Gerard basically
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:03.040]   in that video with Luke's story talks about how the third generation of the biocharger has switched
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:10.880]   from using spark gap technology and it's now using solid state technology so it's using electronics
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:16.160]   to simulate that spark gap that's sparking that pulse that pulse rate and so because they're using
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:21.760]   electronics that software controlled and so it's really really super high tech so not only was he
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:28.080]   the inventor of the concept of the bio photonic multi wave oscillator he's now taking it to another
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:34.000]   level by switching over to solid state technology but that's controlled by software and his most
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.280]   recent version of the biocharger NG which just came out I believe recently within the last couple
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:46.800]   years now also has the ability to download into it frequency sets which they call recipes
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:52.480]   which is now then combining the concept of you know if you go into the world of Raymond Royal
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:59.760]   Rife you know okay I don't want to get it's this is not a Rife machine but you get into that world
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:04.800]   where you start using specific frequencies let's say you've got issues with kidneys you've got
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:10.000]   issues with IBS you've got issues with you know whatever your problem might be that you can actually
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.480]   go out and get frequency sets you know there's it's kind of been this science that's been going on
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:18.880]   for a hundred years where people have kind of figured out hey if you play these five frequencies
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:24.960]   then it will improve X and so then he's got this entire database now and on a cloud and that the
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:29.840]   biocharger actually connects to the Wi-Fi it connects to the cloud and you can download these
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:35.760]   frequency sets again they call them recipes and you can play specific recipes right through your
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:41.200]   machine so that not only is it hitting the entire you know bandwidth from A to B you know A to Z
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:47.360]   right it's also playing specific it's also playing those specific frequency sets for specific problems
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:52.160]   so that's really what this whole amazing thing about the biocharger is it's really taking it to
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:58.240]   another level now they call you know the next generation and that's what's really amazing about
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:02.880]   you know the technology after you know reviewed all of it so you know so it is pretty cool and you
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:09.040]   know the price reflects that so now here you go what a lot of people I think are you know my first
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:12.400]   question about everything and I'm sorry I put it at the end but you know god I got to keep you
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:18.240]   watching the video anyway but hey if you want to experience one of these things and I know I did
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:25.200]   because I ran out and drove for three days with my dogs in the truck across Kansas which is probably
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:32.160]   the most boring drive you could ever make in America and I went and picked up my novel I but this is
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:37.040]   how you if you wanted to go out and say hey I want to try this thing this sounds cool then you can
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:42.080]   first of all you can book a session so now there are again if you go to the quantum pulse I mean all
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:46.480]   the video all these links everything every single thing I'm mentioning I've got a link in my video
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:51.440]   description so that you can do your own research but you can go to the quantum pulse website you
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:57.680]   can find a vibe center or someone a practitioner who has a quantum pulse i.e. vibe machine and you
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:02.480]   can in your area and you can go and book a session with them now the biocharger has the same thing
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.720]   they also have all these different places that are they're using in all these different wellness
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:11.680]   centers you can go book a session one thing too that's interesting is that I found out that if you
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:16.800]   are interested in buying a biocharger then the friendly folks at the biocharger will be more than
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:22.480]   happy to get you set up with one of those folks and have you try it for free so that might be
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.240]   another way to approach it because I was offered yeah you want to try one of these things because
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:31.280]   you know I am interested in getting a biocharger and so you can go book a session through biocharger
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:36.800]   and find a local biocharger person in your area and then also too you know that Tesla energy lights
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.680]   are still out there being used in wellness center so when I did a research or when I did a Google search
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:47.280]   on Tesla energy lights I did find a Tesla energy lights wellness center I don't recall what
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:51.600]   states in but I'm sure if there's one there's probably more but you also can find a Tesla energy
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:56.400]   lights bio center or wellness center to actually go and book a session so if you don't want to buy
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:00.880]   one of these things you just want to try it out there's three places where you can go and try to
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:04.960]   find you know give it a try give it a demo now if you're like me and you just want to purchase one
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:09.920]   because you're you know you're me then there's there's basically the four of them there's all four
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:15.040]   more still available out there you can go buy one so now the quantum pulse I reached out to the
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:19.120]   quantum pulse folks and said hey if I wanted to buy one you know what it costs well brand new
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:23.120]   they're selling them for two twelve thousand eight hundred and if they have a used one on hand
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:27.120]   they'll sell it to you for ninety seven hundred dollars okay so you can go ahead and if you wanted
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:30.720]   to buy one you could reach out to quantum pulse and these are for sale today because they sell
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:36.000]   them new now the biocharger new it's sixteen thousand nine hundred ninety so it's like really
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.640]   expensive uh yeah you know and it's because it's the fanciest one it's got the most going you know
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:46.080]   most different features and all that extra stuff uh so brand new it's sixteen thousand nine hundred
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:50.080]   ninety that's what this one is right here on the left i'm sorry on the right and but you if you
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:55.280]   can find one use there is one right now uh this is uh january six two thousand twenty four
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:52:00.080]   uh there is actually on ebay right now there's a use one someone selling for fourteen thousand
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:04.400]   dollars on ebay now i want to point out though that you know yeah you can save a couple grand but
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:09.360]   here's the idea though there's asterisk right there on biocharger because it's run by software
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:14.880]   after two if you buy one brand new and this is according to the biocharger people if you buy a
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:21.760]   biocharger brand new then you've got two years for free of access to the cloud database to get
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.000]   you know uh software upgrades you know because it's like any other software right it's always
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.640]   going to need annual maintenance and upgrades and patches and you know that crap right but also
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:37.120]   too you have you want access to the recipe database the machine only holds 40 recipes okay so if you
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:41.040]   wanted to swap them in and out you wanted to get different ones and try different ones uh you're
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:46.640]   going to want to have access to that database so after two years okay then if you wanted to have
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:52.160]   a continued so the software subscription to the recipe database uh it's going to be five hundred
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:57.280]   ninety eight dollars per year after the first two years so the biocharger is one of those
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:02.880]   devices where you buy it it's really expensive uh and it's still going to cost you 600 bucks a year
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:07.360]   after the two years every year every year after year so that is one of probably you know it's a
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:12.880]   drawback from a financial perspective so if you're committed to this thing and just be aware it's
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:18.640]   going to cost you and it's going to have an ongoing cost so the total cost of ownership is going to
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:23.360]   be whatever you know however long you own it so it does go up in price you know because of that
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:28.240]   now the Novolite they're selling those use right now on ebay there's one or two of them for sale
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:34.480]   and they're averaging about five thousand each now i was so lucky that the seller that i bought
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:41.120]   mine from they were they posted their ad on ebay for like 3950 and i was like i'd snagged it
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:46.000]   immediately even knowing that i had the drive to go get it um and then after you know you
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.680]   and but here's the funny part after i included from 3950 once you add on the taxes and the cost of
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:58.560]   the trip and the gas alone you know it ended up being around five thousand bucks you know and so
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:02.960]   you know so they're you know that's just the cost of a used Novolite you can get one on ebay for five
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:07.760]   grand that's kind of where i got mine now the Tesla energy lights there is actually one now right
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:13.440]   now on ebay for sale it's also on sale for five thousand dollars so that seems to be the you know
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:18.800]   the kind of like the used price for these devices you know about on five grand on ebay from personal
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:23.200]   people who own these things now i also want to point out to that you know the reason i bought a
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.760]   Novolite is because i can't afford a biocharger uh certainly can't afford a brand new bi machine so
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.800]   you know it's kind of like in my mind it's like hey you know it's a good place to start if you just
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:36.160]   kind of want to tinker around you want one to A that works and B you know you want to tinker around
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:40.880]   with it you know it's kind of a good entry price if you just want to start out somewhere in trying
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:45.760]   to experience one of these biophotonic multi-wave oscillators yourself okay so other than that
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:51.040]   hey you know what i just want to say thank you so much for watching the video i really appreciate
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:55.760]   you know i really appreciate the friendly comments and just engagement of you know this type of
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:00.480]   information this is my passion you know bio electrical magnetic healing devices and also
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:06.080]   quantum healing is really where i just like that's my thing okay so now if you want to learn more
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:10.400]   again all of the links are in the video description so you can go ahead and and kind of just check
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:16.000]   out all of that plus i also found interviews of each one of the different inventors and you know
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:21.200]   i've mentioned a lot about you know the bi machine and about biocharger and i really don't want to
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:26.080]   leave out the fact that the novelite uh there's only like one short little three-minute video about
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:32.080]   the from the maker of that one uh that individual just sold machines and went to shows to sell them
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:36.240]   had a website but they didn't have any type of youtube channel or any thing that really kind of
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:40.960]   took it you know took the information uh to the next level but i want to point out one thing
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:47.600]   that for the Tesla energy lights they have and the biocharger they both have really really deep
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:54.080]   content rich youtube channels and so now the biocharger really kind of goes the modern way of
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:59.600]   just you know lots of user testimonials lots of user information you know all that tutorials and
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:04.240]   all that stuff product information on their youtube channel but if you go to the Tesla energy lights
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:10.720]   youtube channel they went and spent a lot of time trying to understand you know how these devices
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:15.600]   worked and why they work instead of they've interviewed physicists and actually one of the
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:20.800]   things that i found incredibly remarkable about the Tesla energy lights and that's this guy right
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:28.160]   here right is that there's a testimonial video on their youtube channel by dr dittrick clinkheart
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:34.400]   of the sofia health institute now if any of you are in that alternate space like i am you recognize
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:40.000]   the name of dr norman sheely but you'll also recognize dittrick dr dittrick clinkheart as a
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.440]   really reputable you know thought leader in in the world of alternative health and he actually
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:50.880]   has one at the sofia health institute and he uses it in his practice which i found shocking and
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:56.800]   amazing and cool and i'm like wow so i you know i i want to make sure that you know the Tesla energy
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:02.720]   lights product or its devices right up there with the other three in terms of just being an amazing
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:07.760]   biophotonic multi-wave oscillator so anyway learning more lots of video links in the video
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:12.800]   description also too if you like this type of content this is my thing again i'm totally into
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:19.600]   bioelectro bioelectromagnetic healing devices is really my passion i'm just curious and and
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:24.240]   i've been studying this for 20 years and also quantum healing and you can find all my work on
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:28.960]   the tinker's academy just type in tinker's dot academy and you're all window and it goes over
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:32.960]   to my blog and of course i've got my youtube channel and if you like this kind of content

[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:47.280]   spending a long time on quantum healing for a while now and i really kind of want to get back
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:52.240]   into bioelectromagnetics this year for 2024 so there'll be a lot more content like this coming out
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:56.960]   anyway again amen thanks for watching really appreciate your time i hope you enjoyed this
