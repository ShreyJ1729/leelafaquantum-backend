[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   We just did this experiment that I thought was kind of remarkable two weeks ago on quantum
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.800]   entanglement and biological systems. And we've done it, we've repeated it over and over because
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.360]   the results are very bizarre through the conventional lens. So there's a company that I work with
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.960]   called Leela Quantum, and they have a thing called the Heel capsule and the quantum block.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.280]   And so what we were doing was we were taking these cells and it was a double-blinded study.
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.440]   So we take these cells and the fellow that they work with in Germany would send quantum energy
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.120]   to the cells. And what we would do is we would measure the ATP output of the cells before
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.160]   one group of the cells was charged and then we would measure them on time points, 30 minutes,
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.000]   one hour, two hours, four hours, eight hours a day. And without fail, 100% of the time,
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.480]   and they didn't, you know, I would send them a picture of the cells to charge. They didn't know
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.320]   which group it was, the guys that were putting them in the incubator and then running the ATP
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.120]   assays on them with the limonometer, they didn't know which was which. I was the only person who
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.000]   actually knew which was the control and which was the experimental group. 100% of the time,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.560]   beyond statistical doubt, it changed the ATP output just by focusing, you know, quantum energy
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.520]   on these things. So very demonstrably, it's showing that there's an entanglement function
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.320]   in biological systems, which is remarkable. I mean, well, actually, given the, you know,
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.160]   the Nobel Prize in 2022 for physics, you know, showing, you know, kind of Bell's Theorems
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.720]   that you can transfer information faster than the speed of white and that there is, in fact,
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.120]   entanglement, it's not surprising that that is something that the universe would use when it builds
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.240]   biological systems. It's just when you see it firsthand, it's shocking, right? Because it does
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.000]   fit, it doesn't fit inside the model. And one of the fellows is a PhD biochemist,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.800]   really sharp cat that was doing the experiment and running and testing it and putting all the
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.600]   data together. You know, he, you know, compiled and said, well, you know, do we need to do it again?
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.200]   Are we done? Should we write something up? And he said, no, do it, do it a bunch. You know,
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.680]   let's do it a bunch because it's such a bizarre result from the common thought process and what,
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.880]   you know, what you're always taught that I wanted to make sure that it was just beyond
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.160]   reproach, right? Just incontrovertible preponderance of evidence to say like, okay,
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.000]   we don't know how it works exactly, right? But we can demonstrably say it's doing it, right? It's
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.040]   definitely a quantumly entangled function. It's having an outcome, it's shifting the ATP levels,
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.000]   we can guarantee that that's going to happen 100% of the time in all the experiments we've done so far.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   It's probably going to continue, but we don't know why. And that's actually,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.640]   that's the part of science that I love is because it's not a known, it's an unknown, right? Like,
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.520]   I don't know how that works. I'm not sure what's going on there. I know what the out kind of the
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.680]   outcroppings of it are. And I know that we can, we can do like dark field microscopy and look at
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.080]   blood work with the same process and it changes the coagulation of the blood.
