[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me K Almer. And in this video,
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:13.840]   let's talk about topical C60 products. Now a funny thing happened this morning. I was going to
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:21.200]   just post in our C60 telegram chat group. Some of the new products are coming out topically
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.000]   when I realized all of a sudden by looking them up that all of my favorites are gone. They're no
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   longer on the market and that there are new products out there and because I did a I did a
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.120]   C60 topical product review four years ago and I hadn't noticed that since then all of my favorites
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.240]   are just gone and there's a bunch of new ones out there that you know are that are available for sale.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.360]   So I thought I'd just go ahead and instead of trying to post it all in a chat group just make
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.720]   a quick video just to kind of share what I found with you guys. So if you are interested in taking
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:04.320]   C60 topically and and enjoying all of the tremendous benefits of C60 you know for your skin then here
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.480]   you go let's go down the list and I'll show you what's out there. First of all you know I just
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.640]   want to kind of reiterate and this is something I brought up four years ago and nothing's really
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.600]   changed that there are some huge benefits to C60 topically you know a lot of us take C60 oil for
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.880]   longevity and for you know enter cancer and you know all this really great stuff that it does.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.160]   But one of the things that it does is it's really great for your skin
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.000]   and so these are some of the just the bullet points that come out of the numerous studies
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.400]   that have been you know that have been made on C60 and that you know it's antiviral it's
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.400]   anti-inflammatory it's antimicrobial it's antioxidants you know it's cytoprotective it's not cytotoxic
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.960]   it's photoprotective and it and it does a bunch of other things and so it's and one of the weird
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.720]   things that it does is it really helps with acne it's anti wrinkling it brightening moisturizing
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.960]   pore tightening and on these are all of the things that have been discovered over the years about
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.320]   C60 topically so there's two flavors I just want to point out before we jump into the products and
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.960]   that is that a lot of people that sell C60 oil will make an extra bottle put a different label on
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.840]   it and call it you know you know for skin for topical but it's just C60 oil which is C60 in
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.400]   either you know some kind of coconut oil or some kind of you know olive oil and that sort of thing
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.760]   and that's fine you could do that and certainly that's you know you could use it topically but that's
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.760]   doesn't fall into my you know my definition of a C60 topical product which is a product
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.840]   specifically made for your skin as opposed to just using what you would normally you know take
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.960]   orally and so that's kind of the distinction here that you can take anybody C60 oil or make
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.440]   your own and put that on your skin now there's only one you know one caveat to that and this also
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.920]   came up in our chat group recently is that you don't want to go out in the sun if you put C60 oil
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.760]   on your skin because the concentrations higher than it would be in a moisturizer or a cream
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.200]   and that higher concentration of C60 in the oil is going to have an effect with UV from the sun
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.880]   and that's also been proven in studies and when what essentially happens is that when C60 comes
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:24.640]   into contact with UV light it becomes an oxidant as opposed to an antioxidant so instead of it
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.960]   helping repair damage it will cause damage so just as a reminder to everybody out there who didn't
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.800]   know if you put C60 oil on your skin that's fine just do it at night and then by the you know by
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.960]   the morning you know your body's absorbed it and you're fine just do not put it on your skin
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.440]   and go out in the sun all right there's your warning but now these other products because it's so
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.440]   diluted there isn't an issue you know according to the makers all right and there's some really
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.280]   smart people out there making this so their claims are to be you know in my opinion respected in
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.440]   that regard so but yeah just to kind of give you an idea C60 cosmetically goes back years I mean
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.720]   literally for those of you who haven't followed the history of C60 which is totally you know a
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.240]   nerdy thing to do but that's that's me I've actually been following the story of C60
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.040]   you know since I first discovered it in 2012 or 2017 and and one of the interesting thing is is
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.240]   that 2012 was the year that the big you know the big science study came out and that's what got
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.560]   everybody into taking it as you know as a supplement but even prior to that it was used in cosmetics
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.640]   and one of the companies back in the day and these guys are gone now but you know they were
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.400]   putting out commercials about how great C60 is. Novos C60 cream for acne prone skin is formulated
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.280]   with Nobel Prize winning technology full marine C60 and is a great choice for those dealing with
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.960]   common acne full marine C60 is clinically tested and proven to eliminate acne blemishes and tighten
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.520]   pores while maintaining a skin hydration benefit the result no more acne Novos C60 is one of the
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.200]   most advanced skincare systems available Novos C60 is now available in Canada order today for
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.280]   yep and there you go so just to kind of give you an idea you know it's a really popular thing
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.040]   and it and over the last let's say you know 10 15 years you know there's been some movement in
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.240]   the markets and like I was saying back in 2020 I did a topical review product you know a product
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.800]   review and I selected five different products and it was one from C60 Labs three of them from Layla
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.600]   Labs in the Akasha brand and then one was the Layla Labs brand and then the a brand from Red
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.960]   Lion which was being touted as as a topical but you know it wasn't technically a topical so I've
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:48.640]   I've tossed it out because it's only C60 in oil so in this product review I'm only looking at C60
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.280]   skin moisturizers and creams that have other things that are you know beneficial to your skin
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:59.920]   and not just C60 well again you know just starting to repeat myself but it's interesting you know
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:08.320]   because now C60 Labs doesn't even exist Novos C60 no longer exists Layla Labs still selling C60
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.960]   products but you can't find any of their their topicals for sale anymore so you know so it's just
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.760]   really interesting how the market really kind of just did a flip in the last four years as
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.120]   relating to C60 topicals I always thought that it would expand and that there would be more
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.560]   but it apparently may not be as a lucrative business as I thought it was back then but there
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.760]   are some products now and they're out there and Wizard Science is the leading you know to me the
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.840]   leading C60 manufacturer out there primarily because of its founder his name is Ian Mitchell if
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.440]   you're not familiar with them but he is the C60 guy I mean he is literally one of the most
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:54.240]   experienced and educated individuals about C60 a real scientist out there who's developed you
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:00.160]   know these topical products that are you know that not only a for ingestion I mean you know he's
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.120]   developed C60 products for ingestion but also developed this new product which is now on the
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.600]   market and it's called DermaRx and I'll go through these but there's only the five and I was searching
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.920]   all morning to kind of find like okay well what's now available if the ones I used to use all the
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.000]   time are gone and so there's only the five that I could find easily you know without hours and
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.400]   hours and hours of searching so that's what I kind of want to share with you so here let's walk through
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.880]   the five that I found and kind of just you know talk about what makes them special so now
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.720]   here's Wizard Science this is Ian Mitchell's company and he just released this DermaRx product
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:41.360]   like a month or so ago and so he's now developed a product specifically for topical use and and
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.480]   then also that you know if you take a look at the ingredients here it's basically C60 and
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.400]   caprylic acid and it's also got a ubiquinone 50 in it so there's other things like I said it's not
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:59.280]   just C60 in oil but he's created a special formulation specifically for your skin and it's
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.560]   called DermaRx and it's now available on its site oh by the way links to all the products below for
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.720]   anybody that wants to kind of check them out I am not an affiliate of any of these guys I don't
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:14.480]   make any money doing any of this but you know it's definitely an interesting you know turn in in
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.960]   the market that there's no you know there's all new products now so here you go so there's
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:26.320]   the Wizard Sciences DermaRx product now over at the Pure C60 olive oil company they've developed a
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:33.360]   moisturizer now they're calling it just the C60 anti-aging moisturizer product and their product
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.760]   over here and if you look at the ingredients they've got the C60 in there they're also they've
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:44.320]   also combined it with hyaluronic acid the ubiquinone which is what DermaRx has in it as well
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:52.240]   that's also known as your coke coexime C or Q, coexime Q10 you know for that for those of you guys that
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.760]   know that supplement it's got also got vitamin C in it vitamin B5 and vitamin E vitamin E is
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.440]   great for your skin so there's a pretty cool looking product over here I haven't tried it yet
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.000]   I haven't tried any of these yet they're all new I mean I just also just ran out of my favorite
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.200]   lotions that's how I found out that C60 Labs is gone and that and that fill up over at Leo Labs
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.440]   isn't selling it anymore so there's a there's your second one out there that's out there for
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:24.160]   a sale now that's available as a actual you know moisturizing product we stick with C60 in it
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.920]   now fuller life also recently I think this is within the last year or so have come out with a
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.760]   moisturizing cream that has C60 in it and so they're they've got it on there on their list but they're
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.760]   actually selling through Amazon so if you go to Amazon that's where you can find out that the
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:46.080]   special ingredients in addition to the C60 is the squalene oil the jojoba oil and
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.400]   shea butter which are also if you look if you're familiar with moisturizer and cream these are
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.760]   some of those magic ingredients that are super good for your skin now over at the Carbon Cosmetics
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.720]   Company and this is over in Australia they've actually developed a brand new company out there
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:05.600]   that's just popped up they've created three separate topical products and one's called
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.600]   the antioxidant cream there's another one called rehydrate and hyper moisturizer
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.400]   and then they've also got this other one called Regen X which I guess is you know they're kind of
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.200]   like regeneration you know product but you know you can look at the natural ingredients in here
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.360]   and I think that there are some great ingredients you know if you've taken you know taken a look at
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:31.120]   what really moves the dial in terms of helping your skin heal and and anti-wrinkle all that
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.000]   one's wonderful stuff so like you know over here the antioxidant one also includes
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.080]   Moroccan argan oil, macadamia oil, black seed oil and some other stuff, cocoa butter,
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:48.880]   hyaluronic acid again. The rehydrate product pretty much has the same stuff
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.720]   except they also include emo oil which is another really great oil for your skin and then again over
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:00.880]   here for the Regen X product also has some really great skin moisturizer stuff so that's an interesting
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.600]   C60 product if you guys want to give that one a try in out there in Australia and then you've got
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:13.040]   one over here and this is definitely a UK product and the company is called Ishtar Skin Care and
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.000]   they've created a C60 emulsion product and so pretty much you know when you look at the ingredients
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.640]   it's really just C60 and then oil with Ectoin, Ectoin, Ectoin, Ectoin I think that's how you
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.840]   but and vitamin C I'm not sure what Ectoin is I didn't look that up so I'm sorry about that but
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.040]   that's it you know that's the five that I could find out there I haven't tried any of these I'm
