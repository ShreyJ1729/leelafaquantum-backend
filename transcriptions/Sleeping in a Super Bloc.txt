[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.120]   I'm your host Kay Elmer and this video is my testimony and my story of what it's
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.160]   like to sleep in the superblock.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.840]   As some of you may know, I received it about a month ago and I just kind of
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.080]   got a crazy idea that I would just go ahead and sleep in it and to see what happens.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:30.760]   And so the month did not go as I had ever imagined in my wildest expectations on
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.840]   what would happen to me during that month of trialing the superblock.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.880]   And so this is my story.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.680]   And also in the middle of it, I also did a five day trial of the brain support
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.040]   frequency, the new one and had a incredible experience with that as well.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.000]   So here's my story.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.200]   And it's just really kind of hard to tell because there's so much going on.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.520]   So I'll kind of do my best and and hopefully you guys can kind of understand
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.280]   what happened and the results because personally, the results are beyond
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.960]   amazing from what from as to what happened to me.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.040]   So here we go.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.400]   So I just kind of want to start off with the preconditions.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.720]   So you kind of level set on on what I what I'm working with here or what I was
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.880]   doing was first of all, I've never done this before.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.440]   And you know, you, you all know that I've been tinkering with the Layla tool
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.080]   since day one, one of the first persons to ever own a quantum block.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.960]   And I own five or six of them now.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.440]   And so I'm always around them.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.840]   I've tinkered with capsules.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.640]   And so I've just immersed in quantum energy, but I've always done one thing,
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.520]   which is I never put anything in my room, my bedroom.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.720]   Because in the in the very beginning, like four years ago, you know, even if I
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.320]   wore a capsule to bed, it would really disrupt my sleep.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.600]   I'd wake up in the middle of the night.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.880]   And I just really wasn't getting very good sleep.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.720]   So I just really kind of avoided having it in my room, which is, you know,
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.760]   one of the recommendations.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.200]   So I'd never actually slept in a block.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.600]   I've actually put my head and body parts in blocks for various reasons.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.520]   You know, but I've never actually slept in one.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.040]   So this was completely new to me.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.240]   The other thing too, about my sleeping patterns is I'm naturally bi-phasic.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.200]   So I'm just one of those individuals that sleeps in shifts.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.680]   So I have like a night shift and a day shift where I actually, my body just says,
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.400]   Hey, you need to sleep.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.880]   So my natural sleeping patterns are about four hours at night and about four
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.800]   hours during the day.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.200]   You know, so it just depends.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.480]   So that's kind of what I, that's my natural rhythm.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.400]   So, you know, waking up after four hours is totally natural for me.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.280]   So I was kind of just keeping that in mind as I kind of evaluated, you know,
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.560]   like what the impact to my sleep would be because, I mean,
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.280]   to start off sleeping in a 5600 block compared to the other blocks is pretty
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.000]   crazy idea, you know, but that's kind of what I'm known for doing.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.800]   I'm a tinker and I, I just decided to go for it.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.920]   So it was pretty interesting experiment.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.040]   The other thing too, is I'm, you know, I'm a biohacker.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.440]   I'm constantly taking tons of new tropics and anti-aging stuff.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.400]   And, and so I stopped doing that for the whole month.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.000]   I did not take anything that would enhance my performance mentally,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.640]   physically or anything like that during that month.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.880]   And I only took just regular, my regular vitamins and minerals, you know,
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.600]   my stack of those and I did not take anything extra beyond just regular
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.440]   vitamins and minerals for the, for the month so that I could get a true
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.760]   impression of, you know, like, you know, of my mental performance,
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.120]   my physical feeling and all that.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.040]   So it was just vitamins and minerals, no new tropics, no anti-aging stuff.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.800]   And the other thing was, I was running quantum upgrade the whole time.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.480]   And normally I just run it on heal 360.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.720]   And that's what I usually just run day and night.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.080]   And so during the trial, the one month experiment, I was running
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.200]   heal 360 except for the one week I was running the brain support frequency.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.400]   And then the overall objective of this experiment was to just kind of just
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.320]   see what would happen.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.160]   You know, so I did, it's all anecdotal observations.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.240]   I do want to preface that, you know, I don't use Aura rings or Fidbits or,
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.240]   you know, I don't use AO scan or any of these other devices and tools.
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.960]   I just was just going purely off of what I observed of my own, you know,
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.240]   how I felt and what happened and changes in my body.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.880]   So with particular focus of, you know, just paying attention to, you know,
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.040]   does it affect my sleep?
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.560]   Does it affect my dreams and any physical effects that would come from
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.040]   sleeping in a block and using the brain support frequency?
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.560]   So that's kind of what the preconditions of this experiment was.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.960]   And so, and then the other thing I want to kind of convey is how I had placed
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.480]   the plates. Now, as you know, from my prior video, I have one of the
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.280]   prototypes of the super block.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.640]   So my super block is the same size as a grand block.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.120]   It's a square one.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.200]   It's not, it's not one of these round ones, right?
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.880]   These are the final product right here is what's on sale.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.280]   But I actually got a prototype when the super block was programmed as a big,
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.440]   you know, a big block, you know, the size of a, of a, you know,
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.640]   what they call the grand block.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.400]   And so they took the plates off and I set them up on, around my bed or,
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:27.000]   you know, in position of my bed so that the plates here are between where
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.840]   my, basically the trunk of my body would be.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   And that's how I started.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.280]   So that's where I positioned the plates and the other plate is actually on the
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.240]   other side of the room leaning against my dresser.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.240]   So it's about like that.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.960]   So it's about, I would say about a good, uh, easily the plates are easily at
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.840]   least, uh, uh, 15 feet apart.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.280]   So, you know, they're pretty, that's pretty, um, you know, there's a lot of
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.360]   distance in between where I sleep, uh, where my trunk of my body sleeps between
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.560]   the plates to give you an idea of placement.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.520]   Now my dog, I have two dogs.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.640]   This is my older dog, his name is Norman, uh, he comes into play in this story.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.000]   Uh, and so, uh, he normally sleeps down here at the foot of my bed, uh,
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.440]   sometimes he'll crawl up and sleep here, but for the most of the part for the
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.720]   month, uh, he kind of just was hanging out down here at the foot of my bed,
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.040]   my other dog sleeps right here.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.200]   And that's kind of where the dogs were sleeping during the experiment and
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.680]   and things changed throughout the, throughout the month.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.920]   And, uh, so let me just kind of tell you like kind of what happened.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.200]   And as I was trying to figure out how to share this story.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.440]   The only thing, the best approach that I could come up with was just to show
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.360]   you what happened, you know, week by week on a calendar, because I was taking
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.120]   notes, uh, throughout the month as to like what was going on, what was happening
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.920]   and things like that.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.720]   So let me just share with you, uh, the initial reaction that I had.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.440]   And then I had sustained injuries, uh, during this month and the, uh, the
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.600]   effect of the block on my injuries was profound.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.840]   I mean, because, you know, one of the things you might know about the, the
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.000]   superblock is that its character is healing.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   It's, it's, it's a net, it's, it's a natural character.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.600]   You know, it's, it's kind of, I guess it's nuanced.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.720]   This particular block is, is essentially designed it, you know, designed for
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.560]   healing, uh, among, you know, of, of all the other things that you could possibly,
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.160]   you know, set up a block to do.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.500]   And so I really put that to the test this last month.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.640]   Um, and, and again, you know, the, the reaction that I had was just unbelievable.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.680]   So let me, uh, let me start with, Hey, this is what happened.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:35.160]   So, uh, September, I'm sorry, December 2024 on the 4th is when I received my
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:35.600]   block.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.640]   The first thing I did was I set it up.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.720]   And the first thing I noticed was the very first night, um, I had, like, it's
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.560]   like nothing.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.160]   It was like no reactions at all.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.040]   And the only thing I could think of was, you know, normally you set up your
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.500]   block, you put the rods on and, and the recommendation is give it a good four
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.520]   hours to establish its field and it goes to full strength at 24.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.260]   So I had this thing set up in the afternoon and by the time I slept in it, it
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.740]   had probably been, uh, you know, the plates had been facing each other for a
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.420]   good, you know, I don't know, at least nine hours, 12 hours.
[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.900]   However, you know, I slept in it and nothing happened.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.100]   And it was only on the second day of the second night that I slept in it, uh,
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.720]   where I just got, you know, a gut punched in terms of, uh, how I was feeling.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.260]   And I kind of just assumed that when you first set up your block and this is
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.540]   just my, my, my thoughts, if you first set up your block at 15 feet apart, it
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:31.380]   takes, uh, you know, easily 24 hours or longer to establish a full field.
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.940]   So I wasn't really, you know, my impression, my anecdotal observation
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.100]   here was that I wasn't getting the full, you know, force of the block.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.420]   I wasn't getting the full benefit of the super block because I set the plates
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.540]   so far apart, you know, initially, uh, and so it did take over 24 hours to
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:54.220]   finally, you know, establish its field because I felt it, a major, a major impact.
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:09:00.700]   And the very first thing was, and I'm just calling it the micro biome war of 2024.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:05.060]   So the very first initial reaction was something that comes up a lot in our
[00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.500]   discussions on telegram and it's the detox effect.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.620]   And so because of the positioning of my block, you know, it was basically right
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:18.060]   here where the trunk of my body is, what I was feeling, and this is what happened
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.940]   to me, was that very first night of like when I was like, you know, it fully
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.900]   established by the fifth.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:30.460]   And so when I woke up on the sixth for a whole week, I was literally
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.740]   just literally sick to my stomach.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.340]   And I knew that it was a detox effect.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:41.340]   And it just really felt internally to my gut microbiome that there was a war
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:42.540]   going on.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.500]   And when you think about what quantum energy does, you know, it does all sorts
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.300]   of different things that are measurable biological reactions.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:55.460]   And all I could think of was, you know, this, the energy of this block was so
[00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:01.900]   strong that it was basically just amplifying my good bacteria and my
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:07.500]   microbiome in which then set off a war against my, you know, against the bad
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.500]   microbiome, you know, the bacteria in your body, and it just started this war
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:16.980]   and how I could the best way I could explain how I felt that first week after,
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.020]   you know, the block had established itself was I'd sleep in it.
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:26.340]   And every day, I felt like I had eaten something really bad.
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.780]   And there was this war going on.
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.220]   You know, you get that feeling when you know you ate something bad and you
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.700]   know that it's going to come out the back end, you know, in a bad way.
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.340]   But I, but it never did.
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:41.060]   I just continue to have normal, you know, digestive processes and with, you
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.340]   know, like I was going OK.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:48.180]   So I never had like, quote, the colon blow that, you know, you usually expect
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.540]   to happen when you have when you eat something bad.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.220]   But I had all the rumblings that would make me feel like I was about to blow
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.620]   my colon, but I never did.
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.860]   It was just everything kept coming out normal.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.620]   But man, I tell you, my guts were just root up.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.180]   And it was like, I just felt sick to my stomach for a week.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:11.860]   And then the other thing, too, on that Friday, when I woke up, I was about
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:17.580]   as blown away from just this absolute lack of energy.
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.020]   It felt like every last bit of energy was just sapped out of me.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.820]   And I felt like, you know, it was going all towards my gut microbiome.
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.340]   I mean, if you guys have ever had food poisoning, you know how your
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:32.140]   body's energy just then concentrates to just your abdomen and all your
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.460]   body's energy or life force energies focused on, you know, on that on that
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.900]   war that's going on inside your gut and all your energy goes to that.
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.740]   And you get really fatigued and tired because you're sick.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.460]   Well, yeah, I mean, I felt like I was like the walking dead.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.780]   I got up that morning and I barely could walk around and function.
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.540]   And I ended up like just sitting in front of my my UV lamp and just trying
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.420]   to get as much bioelectron, bio photons.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.860]   And I was trying to suck in as much electrons.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.860]   I was zapping myself with my my UV lamp.
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.860]   And then I'd sit in front of my red light lamp.
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.820]   And then I'd sit in front of my my multi wave oscillator and just getting
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.980]   electricity directly, just trying to just really just trying to bring in as
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.580]   much physical bio electrical energy and bio photonic energy into my body
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.500]   because I felt so completely drained.
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:27.860]   Now that whole complete drain feeling was only lasted about just the one day
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:32.300]   on that Friday, the sixth before I started to feel like I had a little bit
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.500]   of energy could move around.
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.820]   But the whole microbiome war lasted about a week in the second week.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.140]   The I didn't feel as as sick.
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.860]   And so for the whole second week that I was sleeping in the block, it felt
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:51.100]   like I'd stabilized and and and everything in my gut kind of just kind of
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.180]   gotten to whatever balance it was looking for.
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:13:00.900]   And I finally felt like I felt really good and for this idea here on on on my
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:07.660]   gut health, whatever it did, it completely reset myself and rebalanced myself
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:15.100]   because ever since that first week, I have had exceptional digestive processes.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:20.380]   If you understand what I mean, I mean, I'm I'm just really healthy from a gut
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.260]   perspective after that experience.
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.340]   And I and I thought I was I thought I was pretty good on the whole detox regimen.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.180]   I mean, you know, when you have five blocks, you think you're pretty immune
[00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.100]   to the detox effect, but this one knocked me off my feet.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.940]   It is that strong and I do not recommend at all.
[00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:42.380]   If you've never ever done this and if you've never put yourself in a block,
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.020]   don't put yourself, don't sleep in this block.
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:49.980]   And I'm just telling you, because and if you do be prepared, because the detox
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:55.620]   direction from doing this was off the charts for someone like me, who's
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:00.100]   constantly doing detox stuff and constantly around blocks, it was it was
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.740]   pretty intense.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:06.340]   But if you do it, I'm just letting you know it takes about a week for me before I
[00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.020]   stabilize.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:12.420]   I do have some, you know, digestive, you know, upset the second week.
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.340]   But after the second week, I haven't felt any problems at all with my gut.
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:21.140]   In fact, I feel like again, I feel really, really healthy, digestion is great after
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:21.860]   the second week.
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:27.540]   But that was probably the first reaction I had was was just I was just blown away by
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:33.700]   how, how it just like, you know, it's just major, major energetic gut punch is
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.060]   the best way I can explain it.
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.780]   But yeah, it was, it was, it was very intense, not for the week.
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:39.140]   Okay.
[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.580]   So I just want to put that out there.
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.540]   So that was what the first week, you know, was that's what it was like.
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.180]   It lasted for two weeks.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.260]   But again, the first week was the most intense feeling, or I didn't feel so sick
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.980]   after the second, after the first week.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.700]   And then on November 11th, this is kind of what a side story, but you know, this
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:03.380]   happened and this was part of my experience was I took my dog for Norman, the older
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.460]   dog to his annual checkup.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.460]   Um, and you know, I hadn't usually tried to do it once a year.
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.060]   I was about six months late.
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.340]   So it was like 18 months late since the last one.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.220]   Um, we went and I just took him because, you know, he was starting, he was throwing
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.700]   up unusually throwing up and he had this thing on his side.
[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.940]   I didn't know what it was.
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:29.420]   So I took him in for a checkup and the diagnosis was Norman has stage five lymphoma
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.660]   with a mast cell tumor.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:33.700]   So he's got two different types of cancer and he's stage five.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.740]   And the veterinarian was like, uh, yeah, he's, he's, you know, that's as, it's as
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.660]   bad as it can get.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.580]   Um, we can't, we can't do any types of surgery.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.180]   He's too, he's too far gone.
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.100]   Um, you got three to six weeks, you know, uh, left.
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:47.900]   Enjoy your dog.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:53.620]   And you know, that, you know, if that's ever happened to you, and this is my second
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.140]   dog, that this is the news I'm getting.
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:01.940]   And so I was just emotionally devastated, mentally thrown for a loop.
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.260]   I mean, my mind, you know, just, you know, everything just stops.
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.380]   Your world stops.
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.700]   And, and all you can think about is like, what am I going to do?
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.940]   Or what are we going to do?
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:18.340]   You know, for Norman and, and so I got that diagnosis on the 11th and as I'm trying
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.700]   to process the, what are we going to do?
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:25.300]   Because when I got the Norman diagnosis, um, you know, we had to set up the first
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:30.820]   meeting and the first appointment with the oncologist and, and start the oncology
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.460]   thing, you know, if you guys have been through this, you know what that's like.
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.100]   So that was set for Friday.
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:41.140]   So, but what happened the day after, uh, I got the diagnosis on Norman, um, I had an
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:45.300]   accident where I was out, literally just walking to go check my mail.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.540]   I tripped over a buckle, uh, in the sidewalk.
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:55.580]   And I slammed as hard as I can imagine slamming onto this concrete sidewalk where
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:17:00.740]   I basically, um, hit my head really, really hard on the sidewalk.
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:06.460]   Um, I hit my head so hard on the sidewalk that when my jaw slammed shut, uh, I broke
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:12.900]   a tooth off, uh, in my mouth, um, and, uh, and it just, and I crushed my knee.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.660]   And I, and I bruised up my elbow really back.
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.340]   So then it's sort of on my right side.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.460]   So I had a really, really bad accident on the day after.
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:27.620]   Uh, and so I cracked my head and broke a tooth that, that Thursday, which kind of,
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.500]   I was just mentally out of it.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.620]   I mean, I was really trying to figure out what to do about Norman and my brain was
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:38.420]   completely obsessed with, you know, you know, with like, okay, I had to process
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:44.100]   this, like, and, and while I was trying to process that, add this severe brain
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:44.500]   injury.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:50.300]   And so that started probably the worst week of my life, which was I had this
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:55.460]   bad injury, um, broke a tooth and I'm not someone that goes to allopaths.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:18:00.340]   I'm one of those grumpy old men that just really don't trust doctors, uh, just
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:04.620]   given my life experience. I saw, you know, I'm a, I'm a heal thyself person.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.860]   So I knew based on all the other experiences, my daughter is an equestrian.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.820]   She's gotten multiple concussions falling off horses.
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:16.820]   And so I'm very, very, very, very experienced in people getting concussions.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.820]   So, uh, my first thing was, was just make sure it wasn't so severe.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.060]   Um, you know, and so I, I did all the things I'm supposed to do.
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.180]   And, but I knew that if I went to the doctor, they weren't going to help me.
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.420]   Uh, you know, cause there's nothing they could do about it.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.740]   Really. So there's just a list of stuff that you're supposed to do about it.
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.260]   So that's what I started to do.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:37.820]   I just, you know, I'd make sure I didn't go to sleep right away and, and I got
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.460]   evaluated by somebody just making sure my mental cognition was still there.
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.780]   Short term memory loss.
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.500]   You look for all these different, uh, little symptoms, but I had some serious
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.260]   brain fog.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.740]   I mean, I got hit in the head really, really hard.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:57.140]   And so the next day, um, we go to, you know, uh, Norman goes to oncology.
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.060]   I can't drive, you know, you don't drive when you're got a severe head injury.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:06.060]   So, uh, my, my daughter came and took Norman to the oncologist for me.
[00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.020]   And then I got on a zoom call and we had a disc, you know, basically a meeting
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:15.060]   in the afternoon with the oncology and you've got this oncology resident.
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.060]   That's basically has 16 expressals too many.
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.580]   And she's just rattling off all this stuff.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:25.460]   I'm supposed to think about option one, option two, option three, option four and
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.020]   all this stuff.
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.980]   So that, you know, so I'm trying to process that.
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.940]   My brain is really like, I'm just in major brain fog.
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:35.740]   I'm trying to process all this information and I'm just like scatter brain.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:40.260]   And then this was also, I had to go to the dentist emergency dentist, uh, where
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.820]   they couldn't, uh, they couldn't fit me in.
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:46.620]   Uh, so they just put a little cap on it, uh, that fell off that night.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.300]   Anyway, so it was just kind of useless, but, um, I went just to get evaluated.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.860]   And then I made an appointment later, uh, the week neck, the following week to
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:58.060]   get the tooth extracted because the, uh, the dentist was like, okay, you broke
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.180]   off too much of the tooth.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.500]   We can't crown it.
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.860]   So your choices are root canal or extraction.
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:09.460]   And again, you know, I don't, I know enough about the real world that you don't
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.740]   get a root canal.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.700]   So I said, no, just, just pull it.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.660]   So I made an appointment for the following week.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.180]   And so here's the deal though.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:23.100]   Um, when I hit my head, I, I wasn't in the presence of mine.
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:28.860]   To use my block, you know, cause I was still sleeping, um, like this.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:34.100]   So I should have in hindsight, um, moved the plates up to where my head was.
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.460]   But instead I didn't think about that.
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.900]   So, uh, you know, but I was still sleeping in the block every night.
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.940]   So I had my first dentist appointment, made the, you know, uh, got evaluated,
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.260]   made an appointment to have my tooth pulled.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:49.940]   And so right in here, you know, after I cracked my head for these days right
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.660]   here, these three days, um, I was in extreme pain.
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.540]   My tooth was broken, no relief.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.420]   A nerve was exposed.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.820]   I couldn't, you know, it's winter time and I couldn't go outside because I
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.620]   couldn't breathe through my mouth because the cold air would just kill me.
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.020]   Uh, you know, and I couldn't eat.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:10.060]   So I was just eating soup and puddings and yogurts, uh, for these, you know,
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.380]   until I could actually have my tooth pulled.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.180]   So it was pretty much, it was, it was absolute help.
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:17.500]   I'm not going to put it lightly.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.380]   So these three days, I'm just in major brain fog and meanwhile,
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.900]   I'm trying to figure out because after the meeting with the oncologists,
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.140]   I got to figure out, okay, well, what's the decision?
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.140]   So then right around in here, Philip gets ahold of me and says, Hey,
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.020]   we got a new brain support frequency on activated it for you.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:34.980]   So you can give it a try.
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.660]   So I'm like, okay.
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.540]   And so I just decided, okay.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.140]   So on Sunday the 15th, I start the brain frequency.
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.940]   I just said, okay, I'm just going to run it during the day.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.500]   And at night, I'm running, you know, heal 360.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.420]   And so I start running it.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:55.340]   And so the craziest part of this whole story was I start the brain
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.700]   frequency while, you know, and I'm sleeping in the block.
[00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:02.620]   Um, and all of a sudden the very next morning I get a black eye.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.980]   I mean, I woke up and my eye wasn't really black.
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:12.220]   It was just red and my eye underneath where I hit my head swelled up and it
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.740]   just got was red.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.380]   It was just like a black eye was completely red.
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.180]   Um, and I just was like, Oh my God.
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.780]   You know, like what the heck is wrong with me?
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.820]   Um, but you know what, intuitively.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:28.660]   I could just feel that this was, this was a good thing.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.580]   You know, like the, like the pressure has now been released and whatever
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:36.020]   bleeding was going on up in my head is now found a path out of my body.
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.900]   So this, you know, in other words, it's relieving the pressure.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:39.380]   Good thing.
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:39.660]   Right.
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.660]   Um, and it's found its way out through my eye socket.
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.660]   And so I woke up with this black eye.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.380]   So another thing that happened that day was when I turned on the brain support
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:58.220]   frequency, um, I just was just, I can't explain it, but it was just what happened
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:02.020]   was I just had a, just just, I guess a moment of clarity.
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.740]   It was just like all of a sudden everything became clear to me as to what
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.940]   I needed to do with Norman.
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.100]   So had a family meeting, went through all the options.
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:16.300]   Uh, thank God, my daughter is a veterinarian student, uh, you know, licensed
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.540]   things, very experienced vet tech, but she's, you know, going to school to
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.460]   become a veterinarian.
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.980]   So she's helping me explaining like what the resident was telling me.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:29.180]   And we have a family meeting and it's just absolute clarity with 100% of my
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:33.740]   heart, you know, intuition and all of that, um, rolled into that where it's
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.620]   just, okay, this is what we're going to do, right?
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.780]   Uh, how we're going to approach helping Norman and, and you know, the
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:42.700]   ultimate decision, uh, where I had wrestled with, you know, it's really
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.220]   hard to kind of process that and try to come up with a decision.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.420]   You know, what are we going to do?
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.740]   But then all of a sudden I turn on the brain frequency support and it's
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:51.740]   like, Oh, clarity.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.700]   It's just, I had clarity.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.580]   I knew what to do.
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.660]   It felt right.
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.580]   I knew it was right.
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.900]   Also conferred with Philip about it.
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.060]   And, um, and it just kind of was like, okay, this is the right thing to do,
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:05.020]   which is, and we chose not to do the, uh, chemo route.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:11.020]   We decided to, um, just treat the, uh, you know, medically treat the tumors, uh,
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.180]   with what they knew would, would, uh, work or what they thought, what they
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:20.660]   were hoping would work to kind of reduce the tumors so that they weren't, um, uh,
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.860]   growing as fast.
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.380]   In other words, buy him some time, buy him some relief, right?
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:29.340]   None of this was going to cure anything, but, you know, just to see what, you know,
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:33.340]   what we could do to help them without poisoning him, which was the, the decision.
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.820]   And it felt right, uh, you know, it's cause I was really wrestling with that decision.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.460]   So, you know, I had this incredible moment of clarity.
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.740]   And then the next day I wake up with this black eye.
[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.900]   Um, and so I get ahold of Philip and, and we're just chatting on, on
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.180]   telegram and I'm like, you won't believe what happened to me after I turned on
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.220]   the brain frequency.
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:55.620]   Uh, and so Philip, uh, offered to check with Roman, cause if you know, Roman
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:25:01.700]   halfner, which is the, uh, Leila healer network, uh, individual who's just incredibly
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:08.540]   gifted. I mean, he's just naturally gifted, um, uh, with the ability to, to, you know,
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:15.140]   basically read and see frequencies, uh, and, you know, it's independent of time and, and, and space.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:20.500]   So he did a, you know, they did a little mini session, uh, for me on me, uh, and then
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:26.900]   Philip got back to me and let me know, um, that after talking with Roman, that, uh,
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.820]   that Roman had had had, had, had sensed that, you know, he could see, uh, however he sees, right?
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.260]   He could see frequencies or he could see your bioenergy and all that stuff.
[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.060]   He's just really amazing human.
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:41.700]   And so Philip got back to me and, uh, and this was kind of what his response was.
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:47.180]   So, you know, I basically said him this little message that said, Hey, it's so serendipitous.
[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:51.460]   You tell me I've had this very odd reaction in the first 24 hours after starting the
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.260]   brain frequency, uh, and I explained to him that I had a fall.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.780]   I had a really bad, a really bad injury on my head.
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:58.700]   And he goes, Hey, you want us to check on it?
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.820]   I'm like, yeah, please, you know, and this is what Phillip shared with me.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:10.580]   Hey, K. So I spoke with Roman and, uh, he said that you actually had a, had a real
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.140]   concussion, um, quite strong one.
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:23.380]   And with the brain frequency, um, within this one night and day, it went from a strong
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:31.940]   concussion to a weak concussion and you still have a slight concussion, though, um, and
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:40.540]   it's indeed like you, uh, intuitively felt it that, you know, the, the frequency is
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:50.100]   supported your brain and the head basically to move out this, um, light bleeding that
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:55.100]   happened, um, and try to find the fastest way out.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:00.220]   And that was the I, um, so that's really a good thing.
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:04.540]   Um, and, but it needs to be looked at again.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:09.060]   So we'll, we'll check again tomorrow because it's, it's your, your light concussion
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.420]   isn't, isn't gone yet.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:18.100]   So maybe still just take it easy, drink good, uh, in a lot.
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:22.220]   And yeah, then that should fade and keep, keep you.
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.260]   Oh, he also mentioned, yeah, keep using the brain support frequency.
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.140]   You know, not at night.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.620]   I would actually go for a heel 360 at night, but you can do whatever.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:36.660]   Um, but, but during the day, it'd be good to, to use the brain support for another
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.460]   few days, right?
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.860]   At least a couple and tomorrow we'll check again and I'll let you know.
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:49.140]   So that was Phillips, you know, basically they did a, you know, a session on me, confirmed
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:53.940]   that, you know, I had a serious concussion, but in one day after starting the brain
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:59.060]   frequency and sleeping in the block, um, the very next day, boom, uh, you know, my,
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.620]   I had a biological reaction to the frequency.
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.860]   It kicked off a self healing process in my brain.
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.260]   This is my interpretation, not medical advice, lots of disclaimers.
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.180]   Uh, none of this is medical advice.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.420]   Okay, but what happened to me was I turned this thing on.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.580]   I'm sleeping in the block and then boom, it kicks off a cell.
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.180]   You know, it's, it's, it's healing me.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.980]   And so it just kicks off this rapid healing process.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.940]   And all of a sudden the blood just comes right out of my eye socket.
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:32.060]   Um, and by the way, you know, all the pain was gone at this point.
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:38.020]   Uh, you know, I, I got hit in the head on the 12th and, uh, by the couple of days
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:42.020]   later, uh, it just wasn't, it didn't hurt anymore unless I touched it, you know, which
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.900]   was strange to me because I had a one hell of a wealth on my head.
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.660]   But the pain went away.
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.060]   I'm in the block every night.
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:55.340]   Um, I started this frequency, it kicked off some amazing reaction to my head.
[00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.300]   Um, and the blood just comes out of my eye socket.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:03.740]   And, and I just, it just like in my eyes all swollen, but it doesn't hurt.
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.740]   And it just feels like this is, this is good for me.
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:09.300]   You know, so it was just bizarre.
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.180]   It was like the most bizarre thing that ever happened.
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:15.100]   I never, ever had something where I used a frequency and then immediately
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.060]   something happened to me.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:21.180]   Uh, so like, like this was, I sat in the block, immediately had a reaction, turned
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.980]   on the frequency, immediately had a reaction, you know, and then I'm in the
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.940]   block every night now.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.940]   So then that was wild.
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:31.100]   And then of course Norman had his second oncology appointment on the 17th where he
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:36.180]   first got treated with something called L spar, uh, and, uh, for the lymphoma.
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.740]   And then he's got, he's doing all these, he's doing two other drugs for his mass cell.
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:44.100]   So he started his medication on the 17th.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.660]   So then on, uh, what happened then on, on the 19th was I finally go back to the
[00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.140]   dentist, uh, and they have to extract it too.
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.300]   So I have like, like tooth surgery.
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:59.460]   Um, and, um, yeah, that was where I realized that I need to move the plates
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.780]   up to my head, you know, and I should have been doing it the whole time.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:10.480]   So at this point, you know, I have, my tooth is pulled, um, and it's, you know,
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.520]   they're numbing me up.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.240]   And so the doctors are going, you know, the, the dentist was like, okay, uh, you
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:19.960]   should take Tylenol or ibuprofen, uh, you know, once, you know, and do it as soon
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.720]   as you can, once the swelling or once the, the numbing agents wore off, you're
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.400]   going to be in a lot of pain.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.760]   So what I did was, is right when I came back from, uh, having my tooth extracted,
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.960]   uh, I went and I just went and put the block up.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.560]   This is when I actually moved the block up so that it was over, it was like,
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.840]   I was sleeping between the plates with my head between the plates.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:46.240]   And so I just took a nap, uh, after I came back from the dentist, uh, with my
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.240]   head between the plates, I was probably asleep for a few hours.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:55.640]   Um, and the most amazing thing happened then, which was when I woke up, you know,
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.560]   I could, my, the numbing was gone.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.760]   I could feel my tongue and my lips and everything, but I wasn't in any pain.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.920]   I had actually stopped at the store on the way home and bought a little bottle of
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.240]   town and all and a little bottle of ibuprofen because I don't really use those,
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.200]   but I bought them, you know, cause the dentist was telling me I was going to be
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.320]   in a lot of pain and I was bleeding a lot, by the way.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:20.080]   Um, but I woke up, the bleeding was stopped and it wasn't hurting.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.640]   It didn't hurt.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:25.040]   It's, it hasn't hurt since, uh, it's just, it never, I never felt the pain.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.240]   I went, you know, it's just really weird, right?
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:32.640]   You go and have a tooth extracted, um, out of your mouth and they, you know,
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.520]   you don't feel the pain because you're numb.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.440]   And then the numbing thing wears off and you don't, you don't feel the pain.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.760]   Uh, I had my head in a block for that long.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:46.600]   And so I left, uh, I left the, uh, uh, the block.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:53.080]   Set up like this for about, I would say, I'm, I'm guessing that it was set up
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.920]   like that for about three or four days before I moved it back to my body.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.680]   So, but basically though, it was like the bleeding stopped.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.600]   The pain was gone.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.920]   My head didn't hurt anymore.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.840]   Now my tooth doesn't hurt anymore.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.560]   And I'm starting to feel really, really good mentally.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.040]   So, but as Philip mentioned, uh, they did check on me that, uh, the second day.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.000]   And that's when Romans said, Hey, you need to leave the brain frequency
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.240]   on for a couple more days.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.960]   So that's, that's this year.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.040]   So I started, I used the brain frequency and slept in the block.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.280]   Uh, you know, the whole time I was sleeping in the block, but I left the brain
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:28.280]   frequency on for five nights, uh, per, uh, Romans recommendation.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.880]   Uh, and then after I, you know, I turned off the, uh, the brink
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.520]   with frequency on the 20th.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.920]   And by that point, uh, again, my, my tooth was not an issue.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.240]   I'm just missing a tooth now, uh, and, and my head just doesn't hurt anymore.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.760]   Um, my eye started to reduce.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:51.160]   I mean, I had pretty much swollen eye and then by, by Friday, it was just
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.280]   like my eye was normal.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.120]   The blood was gone.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.600]   My eye looked normal.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.920]   Um, and it was just the weirdest experience.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.200]   I mean, it was literally the strangest experience, uh, uh, just going
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.800]   through something like this, because you would think it would take a lot longer
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.080]   for all of these things and a lot more problems, but none of that happened to me.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.320]   Thank God.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.160]   So then Friday, I really screwed my back.
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:16.640]   Um, I started trying to do some stuff with Norman to help him out.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.680]   And so I picked and I had anyway, long story short of picking him up.
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.920]   He's 28 pounds.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.280]   I've have a disability with my back.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:28.480]   I've had it for my lifetime, uh, since I had a couple of major accidents as a young
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.160]   man, uh, I wrenched my back really bad.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.640]   So, but anyway, I, without, I just picked him up wrong and I
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.040]   royally screwed my backup on the 20th.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:43.680]   And it was so bad where, you know, I'm onto my third major physical problem, uh,
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.120]   during this form, my four week trial.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:52.520]   And my third problem was I hurt my back so bad I could barely walk.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.640]   And so I literally just sat on the couch, uh, because the only time I wasn't
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:59.320]   in screaming pain was sitting or laying down.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.000]   So I couldn't walk.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.440]   And so, uh, you know, my daughter's coming over, feeding me.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.200]   I mean, it's horrible.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.520]   So I mean, I couldn't, I couldn't do anything with my back.
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:12.920]   So right around here, uh, is where I, I switched it back.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.280]   Uh, I think it was that Saturday was I switched it back.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:21.040]   Where I'm like, okay, uh, you know, now I feel like I got a handle on the,
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.360]   on the pain on the tooth.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.160]   Now I moved the plates back to where they're over my body.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.640]   Uh, I'm not having any microbiome issues now with this time.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.280]   But at this point, you know, now I've got a just really bad back.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.640]   I can't walk normally when I have bad back problems.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.440]   You know, I got to walk with a cane, um, but you know, it's, it's rare.
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.920]   Uh, but this one was, I, I couldn't even function with cane or not.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.200]   So I just barely could move.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:50.560]   So I moved the block plates back to where my body is in between them, right?
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:55.760]   And boom, within two days, I'm, I'm, I'm normal.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.960]   I'm just sore and it was like, wow, that was the fastest I'd ever recovered
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.400]   from wrenching my back ever in the history of me.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.240]   And I was just like, whoa, this thing is like really healing me.
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.800]   It's, it's, it's healing me so fast.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.040]   I can't believe what was happening to my body.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.920]   So literally all this stuff happened to me and by the time Christmas came,
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:22.640]   which was basically less than two weeks since I cracked my head less
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:26.400]   and a week, less than a week before I had to have a tooth extracted.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.880]   Just a few days after I just killed my back, where I couldn't even walk.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.760]   And I'm like walking around and, you know, we're just doing the Christmas stuff.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.120]   And, and it was like, it was, it was like none of this had happened,
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.480]   except for I'm missing the tooth.
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:43.040]   And in fact, one of these nights that right in here, I think I was sitting near
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:49.400]   and I just was just like rubbing my head and the scab just falls right off.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.880]   Like it healed so fast that I don't show you a picture of what it looked like.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.000]   But the scab just falls off and my head looks completely normal.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.160]   Like nothing happened.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:02.800]   I literally went from having a severe concussion and kicked off
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:08.440]   to a mild concussion to what I feel like I'm completely back to normal.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.040]   The scab is gone.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.040]   The blood's gone.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.280]   I looked normal, like it had not, it hadn't even happened.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:19.200]   And that's what was so bizarre because by Christmas, it was like none of that had happened.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.040]   None of it had happened.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.320]   It was so strange, but that's what I was doing.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.920]   So I continued to sleep in the block.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:34.000]   And, and I just basically every day I sleep in it, I wake up and I feel awesome.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.960]   And I just slept in the block again.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.840]   I'm still sleeping in the block.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:42.960]   And today's the third of January, we got through New Year's Day.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:50.040]   And right now, as of yesterday, we took Norman to his third oncology just for the
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:55.360]   checkup because it's three weeks after diagnoses to see if the, you know, the medicines
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:59.440]   helping and also, you know, what else could we be doing?
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:05.280]   And so luckily, just good news is that his, his lymphoma and his, and his mast cell
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.640]   tumor, they've reduced in size by 15%.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.080]   He's having good days because he was having a lot of bad days.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.320]   They, you know, I'm keeping a log so I have good days and bad days.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.760]   And he was having nothing but bad days for a couple of weeks.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.200]   But he's had a bunch of good days.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.440]   It's like he's sleeping in the block with me, but not directly.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.480]   As you can see from the photo right from the diagram.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.840]   And so this is kind of how it was.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:37.520]   And so as of, I guess it was like as of Christmas, though, I started to move the block.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:43.280]   So I've moved the plates now down to here where Norman is now sleeping in it.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.440]   And now Norman's sleeping in it.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.400]   This was about right here.
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:53.800]   So right about here is when I got over all of my injuries and I started and I decided I
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.400]   needed to start focusing on Norman.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:59.560]   So I put Norman, I moved the plates so that Norman sleeping in the block with me.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:04.080]   You know, my feet are still in the block, but in he is fully in the block at night.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:07.480]   And so ever since I put him in the block, we go to oncology.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.160]   And we get this great news that he's actually doing well.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.240]   I mean, he's still got stage five lymphoma, all right.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:19.240]   But this original thing that the veterinarian told me was like, you got your
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.240]   dog has three, three to six weeks.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.440]   Well, it's been three weeks and he's doing really well.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.520]   And so now it's like, oh, you know, this is great.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.160]   So I'm keeping Norman in the block along with me.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.040]   I'm healed.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.240]   He's doing well.
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:42.040]   And that's just really the remarkable story of my December of not only testing out, you
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:47.160]   know, what I originally wanted to do, right, was I wanted to test out how to affect
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.480]   my sleep and dreams and if I had any physical effects.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:55.320]   And yeah, the answer is, yeah, I had some physical effects.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:59.080]   I had some incredible physical effects that were not planned.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.840]   And that's kind of how it goes.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:04.800]   So just kind of wanted to show, you know, I normally don't show my face because, you
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.360]   know, I got a great face for radio.
[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.560]   That's why I don't show it.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.040]   I like my privacy as well.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.520]   But I just wanted to show you that, you know, this is how bad it was where my injuries
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.040]   were, the severe concussion broken tooth back injury again.
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:21.960]   This is right after I hit it right after I'd fell and I'd smashed my head.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:27.960]   This was like that, you know, that day later, you can see this giant baseball lump on my forehead.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:34.400]   And then, of course, when I got the black eye, this was like the day after I woke up with it.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.240]   So the very first day, my whole eye was red and swollen.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.760]   This is the second day.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.000]   And, you know, this is, you know, just me and my eye.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.520]   And then, of course, my head injury was was healing.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:52.400]   And of course, this is the day after I had my tooth removed and I lost a tooth.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.000]   So yeah, it was, I got beat up real bad guys.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.840]   But, you know what, I'll tell you, between the brain support
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:05.160]   frequency and being in that block, I do not believe at all that I would have healed as fast.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.840]   I mean, I healed so fast.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:11.240]   And the one thing I do want to point out, you know, if you take a look at, I mean, you just Google,
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.760]   like, how long does it take for someone to recover from a severe concussion?
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:19.080]   You know, they're basically saying, and this is just average, you know, that most people
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.560]   are back to normal within six months.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:26.160]   I was back to normal in two weeks because I was in the block every day.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.320]   And that's, I'm attributing that.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.080]   And that's, you know, this is my opinion.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.040]   This is all my opinion.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:37.200]   But I'm telling you that I being in that block was a game changer for what had happened to me
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.400]   last month, and I believe it's becoming a game changer for Norman.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.720]   So I'm going to keep leaving the block plates like this.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:48.920]   I want to have him sleep in it and I'll be doing another video on, on saving private Norman.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:51.440]   But bottom line, though, here's my summary.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.760]   Now, what happened to my sleep?
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.400]   No effect to the sleep, no detrimental effect.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.320]   I continue to sleep four to five hours a night and three, about three
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.560]   hours, three to four hours during the day in my block.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.320]   And there's been no disruption to sleep whatsoever.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.040]   I get a good night rested.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:11.000]   You know, I feel great when I wake up, like I said, now my dreams.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:18.600]   The interesting thing about my dreams was, is that the whole time I've been in the block,
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.240]   I don't remember my dreams now.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.040]   You know, that's just me, right?
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.600]   And I'm just telling you that is my story.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.920]   But I usually remember some of my dreams, but I don't remember any of my dreams.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.720]   And then when I wake up in that morning, in that very moment of lucid, you know, lucid
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.280]   dreaming, where you're starting to wake up, you know, you're asleep, but you're still
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:45.120]   due to sleep, I am very cognizant because normally, you know, my experience with lucid
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:50.280]   dreaming is you're, you're kind of like, you know, well, if you talk to the, you know, energy
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.160]   workers, you know, you kind of do astral projection and you're kind of, you know, you go off
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.120]   on to different dimensions and things like that.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:01.760]   And, and then you come back into your body and you're kind of just kind of like, you
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:06.520]   know, just confused and you're partially, you know, but bottom line, those, you've got
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.600]   a lot of just, you know, you're just trying to get back into your body.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.920]   You're trying to just wake up and you're kind of groggy, right?
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.080]   No, I don't do that now.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:18.480]   When I'm in the block now that I'm sleeping in the block, A, I don't remember any of my
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.440]   dreams. I don't remember what happens when I go to sleep.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.680]   And when I wake up, I'm really cognizant.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:29.200]   Like I'm thinking, I mean, I'm actually thinking and processing like I would if I was awake.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:34.600]   So it's like I'm really conscious, you know, instead of unconscious.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:35.880]   And it's just the strangest thing.
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.520]   It's like my body sleeps, but I don't.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:42.280]   Um, and it's just the weirdest thing when it comes to my dreams.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.680]   So no bad dreams, no negative things.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:50.240]   It's just a really weird feeling that I'm going through when I, when I start the first wake up
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:55.520]   in the mornings, I'm thinking already, like as if I'm awake, there's no grogginess.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.400]   I go straight from body wakes up and I'm, I'm conscious.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.320]   I'm 100% conscious.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.640]   I'm thinking I'm, you know, my brain's processing and I just get out of bed.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.200]   And, and it's, there's no grogginess at all.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.640]   It's really strange.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.480]   And that's, that's what's going on with dreams.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.200]   Now, of course, I did talk about the major detox reaction.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.920]   That took again a full week to get over.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:18.640]   Uh, and I just pushed through it and made it.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.720]   Uh, it was not pleasant, but I did it.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.920]   And the second week was a little rough, but nothing like the first.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.840]   And then after that, I just feel they were great.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.080]   And then of course, you know, the character of the super block is healer.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.120]   And I will tell you 100% it is yes.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:38.440]   It is a healer block and it is the most amazing experience I've ever had ever.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:43.360]   Uh, you know, in terms of like not only having the accident, um, but also just how fast
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.000]   I recovered.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.480]   And again, you know, like with what happened with Norman, uh, he's getting better.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.400]   Uh, well, he's not getting worse.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:49.720]   Okay.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.200]   I mean, that's probably the best way to put it.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.000]   He's not getting worse, but yeah, that, that's my story.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.040]   It's January 3rd.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:00.680]   Now I'm going on my fifth week in the block and I've decided that, you know what?
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.920]   This was so amazing.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.120]   I'm just going to permanently sleep in a block.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:08.480]   And if, and then again, too, I want to stipulate, if you understand, like if you
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:12.720]   watch my video called, what does quantum energy do where I summarize all the
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.560]   biological responses that have been evaluated and measured, um, through the
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:20.200]   studies, there are so many biological things happening.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:25.760]   Um, while you're subjected to quantum energy now, not, and I'm subjecting myself
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:30.080]   to quantum energy, this at the absolute strongest level ever.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:35.680]   And I'm now experiencing the biological effects of that, uh, experience.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.440]   And so there's so much more going on, you know, we're talking about oxidative
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.960]   potentials and ATP production and accelerated wound healing for sure.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:49.480]   Um, and that's kind of really what's been my experience here is that sleeping in
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:55.240]   the block has just been unbelievable in terms of my physical reactions to it.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:59.520]   Um, and the best part about it was I was worried in the beginning that I wouldn't
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.080]   be able to sleep in it, but that's not been an issue.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:06.040]   I kind of do miss being able to dream like dream, dream, you know, like normally
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.760]   dream, um, but so that's a kind of a weird little quirk.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:10.920]   And I'm just sharing that.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.760]   And that's, that's really it.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:13.720]   That's my story.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.720]   It's been a crazy month.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.320]   I don't want to do it again.
[00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:21.920]   Uh, I just absolutely don't want to go through what I went through.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.240]   And it's just so weird.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.320]   You know, if you, if you, if you understand the universe, the universe
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.200]   does what the universe does, right?
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.120]   There's an old, old saying.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.840]   I think it's an old Buddhist saying or something like that.
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:36.480]   It says, if you want to make the universe laugh, show it your plan.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.600]   And that's so true because the universe does what the universe does.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.760]   And so I don't know whether the universe said, Hey, you know what?
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.640]   Um, let's put the block to a real test.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:51.720]   Let's slam your head against the sidewalk and let's break off a tooth and crunch
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:56.000]   your back so we can test out and, and how well the healer aspect works.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.920]   Because that's exactly what happened.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:01.000]   It's so bizarre to me that all of this happened, right?
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.360]   When I was doing this experiment, but that's what it is.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.320]   That's my story.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.000]   Uh, and so there you go.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.920]   And I would love to hear what you guys are experiencing with the super block.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.240]   Also what you guys are experiencing with the brain support.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.960]   Um, I'm already seeing some great testimonials and quantum
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.400]   upgrade of people using the brain support frequency.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:26.840]   It sounds so amazing for those of you who are using it for other things.
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:32.280]   And if any of you, um, get the craziest idea like me that you're going to go
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.400]   sleep in this thing, uh, yeah, it'd be, it'd be so great to compare notes
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.960]   and see how, how it affects you.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:42.120]   And hopefully the universe doesn't decide to put you through this test, uh,
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.880]   like I did, but that's it.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:44.960]   That's my story guys.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.080]   And I just want to say thanks for listening to it.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:51.360]   I know that a lot of you are interested in what actually happened to me, uh,
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:52.760]   and how I reacted to it.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.720]   And there you go.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:54.960]   Here's my story.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.800]   So thanks for watching the video.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.880]   Hope you found this interesting, uh, you know, if you liked this kind of stuff,
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.840]   like and subscribe, uh, I do crazy stuff all the time.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.640]   And, uh, this was obviously the craziest thing I've ever done.
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.480]   If you want to know more about me, I'm at the Tinker's Academy blog.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.600]   I'm also on YouTube and, uh, also, you know, I do have a health and healing
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.640]   telegram group if you're interested in that kind of stuff and you want to join
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:16.560]   just, you know, link below.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:20.800]   So, but anyway, that's my story of sleeping in the grand block.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.280]   I'm sorry, the super block.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:27.840]   And what happened when I turned on the brain support frequency, it's the wildest
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:31.640]   story, uh, ever, uh, in terms of all the things I've done with quantum.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:35.320]   And, um, I look forward to continuing to sleep in it because, you know,
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.920]   one more of the thing that I mentioned, right?
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.880]   And my unboxing video was that while I'm sleeping in this block,
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.760]   not only is it doing all that stuff I mentioned, but this super block has that
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.280]   deuterium, uh, mitigation frequency in it, right?
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.520]   So it's, it's lowering the deuterium levels.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:55.440]   So it's really an anti-aging hack, but, you know, it's really hard to evaluate
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:59.920]   anti-aging, but, uh, I know for a fact that, you know, uh, not for a fact, but I
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.120]   know that it's, it's doing this anti-aging thing to me as well.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.800]   And, uh, and that might be part of how it heals so fast.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:07.200]   Who knows?
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.040]   But that's just something else that's going on.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.600]   So all of my water in my body is getting structured every night.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.320]   The deuterium is getting loaded.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:18.960]   I'm getting a rapid wound healing, uh, you know, in fact, and yeah, it's, it's
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.360]   amazing. It's amazing. Anyway, that's my story. Aloha.
