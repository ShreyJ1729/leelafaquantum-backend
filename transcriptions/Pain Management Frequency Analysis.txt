[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and this video
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:14.800]   I'm gonna be going over the recent contest results that Layla Quantum Tech had when they opened it up to all of the members to create a
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.340]   Molecular frequency set that would help with pain management
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.800]   So what happened from that?
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.080]   Contest was really the first time that I as somebody who's been doing you know
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.400]   Kind of tinkering around with putting together these frequency sets for years
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.800]   This was the first time that I'd ever had a clear
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.020]   You know winner. I mean basically a clear accepted set of frequencies that said yeah, this is great
[00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.120]   This is the best one out of a whole bunch of them
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.320]   Compared to the one that I had you know created myself in other words
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.280]   There has never been a time up till now where I've actually been able to do a really good analysis of what's a great
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.240]   You know frequency set compared to what I was thinking it could be and so I just really did some analysis on it
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.160]   And I wanted to share it with you
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.080]   Because I think it's really important for those of you guys who are tinkering around with frequencies
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.280]   You know that we can learn from this and and then you know fine-tune our craft so to speak
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.720]   But the idea though is that this is the first time that I've ever been able to just say oh okay great
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.800]   This is what works now. I can then try to model off of what works and breaking it down through analysis
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:34.360]   So I just kind of wanted to just share my thoughts with you on on what had happened and my submission versus the winning
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.920]   Submission and so you know if you're interested in that
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.480]   Great, you know if not then it's probably not your thing
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:48.800]   But this is all about coming up with frequencies that help your body with health and healing and performance and longevity
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.280]   So if you're someone who tinkers around with frequencies and you want to learn more about which ones to use or how to use them
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.680]   Then you might be find this interesting. So there you go. Anyway, let's jump right into the content
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.240]   So the very first thing I kind of want to point out was just kind of my history
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.000]   You know I've been working with Philip at Leila Quantum Tech for four years now
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.800]   And I've have created some boosters that are available on the site and through quantum upgrade
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.280]   And to kind of give you an idea. It's not my primary area of interest
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.440]   I do a lot of different things so I kind of tinker around with it, but over the last few years, you know
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.760]   I've submitted nine different frequency sets to fill up for evaluation
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.080]   And then he's chosen five of those so I got a 56%
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.760]   You know hit rate on on submitting things that that end up working and then get
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.280]   You know available to the public and when I say end up working the process has been where I submitted to Philip and then you know
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.120]   he has his healer network review the frequency
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.000]   Right and then if they and if they pick up the right vibration, they pick up the right
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.840]   You know everything that's involved in that
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.400]   You know these people are very gifted and talented and they have you know gifts that normal people don't have so when they
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.640]   Consense that this thing is yeah, this thing does what we want it to do or what it's supposed to do
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.040]   So once it gets the green light from the healer network
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.080]   Then it usually goes out to 20 or so folks who then go in and and do you know
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.680]   Just they just run a test on it and then if we get you know 20 positive responses
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.960]   From the frequency then it then it goes out for sale
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.760]   So there's quite a bit of an evaluation and a QA process for what's on the website
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.720]   So if you see it for sale, then it's gone through this process by which you know
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.800]   They're selling something they don't want to you obviously don't want to sell anything that they that doesn't work
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.160]   So, you know, that's how they do it. So but again, you know, I've only submitted nine
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.440]   You know and and for those of you that use the service, you know that the men's booster and the woman's booster
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.280]   Have been around since the inaugural set of products that went out on day one
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.640]   And they've been very they've been very popular all these years and and to me
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.520]   I kind of like when I created those two it was just a you know
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.880]   I had no idea what I was doing
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.000]   It was literally my first attempt and I and I just got lucky
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.040]   I really feel like I got lucky with how to figure that one out, but now
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:20.400]   What's happening now with this contest with the pain management contest has been complete game changer in and just
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.960]   Being able to learn more about how to do this and I think this is really important
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:33.240]   From that standpoint if this is something you're into and I think it's you know to me frequency medicine is is the future
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.920]   And so but if this is what you're into because you know why?
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.360]   There were 70 people that had submitted entries, you know
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.560]   for the contest for the quote the best pain management and only four
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.760]   Ended up clearing the process and getting into getting turned into a product
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.960]   And so that's like only six percent were chosen out of the 70
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.040]   64 people kind of you know missed the mark and you know
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.520]   Nothing wrong with that and then you know, it's great. You're all tinkering. I you know
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.360]   I'm one of the ones that missed the mark and I feel you know, hey, that's no problem at all
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.840]   I mean, this is a learning experience as far as I'm concerned and congratulations to the winners
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.880]   So for the first time ever, I'm like, oh great now
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.240]   I have an example of what I submitted and what what was the you know that what worked?
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.800]   I'm so yeah, I want to I want to understand what the differences are what are the nuances in what worked?
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.640]   So that's what I've been doing and that's what this video is about
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.040]   So now that's been my experience with boosters
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.880]   And so just to kind of give you an idea my approach
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.520]   Towards making frequency sets and I make a lot more sets than you'll ever hear about
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.800]   Because I don't submit them all the for you know to fill up
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.200]   I just I make a whole bunch just for me for my family for my dogs, you know
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   I'm always tinkering around with that
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.720]   So, you know, I don't try to like, you know, get them on get them on the website or anything
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.920]   That's not really my ultimate goal my ultimate goal is you know helping myself and my family
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.960]   But the approach that I've always taken when I want to try to figure something out
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.400]   And I just want to share just the approach was is that I look at the whole body approach
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.800]   And so when when so when I approached and I'll show you what I did with the pain management
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:25.560]   I approached it from the whole body, you know, like, okay, so what are all the ways that the body itself, you know
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.520]   Manages pain and then I looked at that's the internal forces and then the external forces
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:37.080]   I looked at or what were the kinds of drugs and peptides and supplements that then could help the body
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.920]   You know, you know, actually not even help the body, but actually mask that stuff, right?
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.840]   But anyway, so what could you take for pain versus what you could take to help your body
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.560]   Help itself with pain, you know, external external
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:57.760]   It means external and internal and then I looked at, you know, like overall like how do the frequencies what frequencies would
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:05.560]   Would support, you know, managing pain from a bio field from, you know, standpoint and also from your foundational health
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.840]   I mean, there's this issue about, you know, we're all
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.040]   Sort of, you know, deficient in something and blah blah blah dehydrated and whatever
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:18.040]   But the idea though is like if you've got poor health and you don't address that then trying to fix a problem
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.560]   You're having as a result of the poor health, you're never going to get to that, you know, that stage, right?
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.280]   Got across one bridge at a time
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:30.680]   So in trying to create a frequency set then I look at, you know, like how do I support that health as well?
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.380]   You know, just foundational health, right and the emotional aspects
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.240]   I mean a lot of the times people are feeling, you know, and this is the thing, right?
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.040]   Philip never mentioned when he said, hey, this is a pain management. He never said it was physical pain, right?
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.680]   And so you can just as much have emotional pain, right?
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.440]   And so I kind of looked at it like, okay, he didn't define it
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:56.280]   So I looked, I looked at it from both perspectives, so emotionally, you know, and then also mental, you know, when people are in pain
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.400]   You don't think the right way, so how do you help with that?
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:06.200]   And so that's my, you know, that's kind of my approach and yes, I overthink everything. I'm extremely left brain
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.560]   And so yeah, so you know, I just I came from that background
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.480]   And so I kind of that's the approach that I take whenever I make anything
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.000]   So if you look at the what's in the boosters, you'll see the exact same process
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.600]   You'll see all this stuff in there in the boosters and the testosterone one and the inflammation one and the allergy one
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.720]   You know all the ones that I've made that are for sale on the website
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.280]   You'll see that, you know, those are the kind of the components right that I tried to address
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.900]   Now the last thing I want to kind of point out in just my approach towards
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:43.400]   creating frequency sets is the role of harmonics and I put out like I did a post a while ago and
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.880]   Just trying to explain to someone who had asked in the telegram group and basically my explanation was in the way
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.680]   I look at this is like it's like cooking, you know
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.600]   I'm for anybody who's ever took a cooking class or if you've ever been in music
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.080]   I mean, I'm not a musician
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.720]   but I spent years of my life in in choirs and choruses and and groups, you know
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:10.040]   Throughout my youth as you know singing so you know, I learned, you know, I learned how to read sheet music and all that and so I understand music
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.600]   I understand cooking and and I look at that as like, you know
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.240]   That's kind of what you're trying to do because you're taking all of these different things whether it's a
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:25.320]   Ingredients in a recipe or different instruments and you're combining all of them and you create this finished product
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.520]   That is not, you know, it's like, you know
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.720]   It's basically not the sum of the individual parts
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:37.040]   But a whole new thing that does a whole new, you know different thing than in each individual part
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.640]   And so that's kind of been my approach is to create a harmonic, you know
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.720]   That that's sort of like, you know, the like the music that comes from multiple
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.960]   Into you know instruments or the you know or the end result of you know combining ingredients
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:56.580]   So that's how I look at it and that's been very successful for me in terms of, you know, having
[00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.960]   Frequencies sets that I've created that actually do what they're supposed to do
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:05.040]   And so that's kind of my been in my approach and I wanted to share that with you because you know
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.240]   This is going to be kind of a learning experience for all of us because there's a new contest now
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.840]   Deadline sometime in September. It was announced last week
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.240]   Where the next contest to create a frequency set is
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.640]   Going to be for sleep and rest, you know
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.080]   And so I think what the healer network is thinking because I haven't talked to Philip about it yet
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.960]   But I think they're looking at it, you know seeing if they can come up with a better frequency
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.560]   Then they have now and they're opening it up to the membership because of just incredible results
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.880]   That they had with the pain one so so there you go
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.560]   So now the winning one and this is going to be published
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.960]   I'm we I'll be publishing this video after it's been announced, but the winning entry
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:51.120]   Has only six ingredients in it, which is which blows me away because you know
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.000]   I'm like mr. Overkill and you know, I mean like, you know, the boosters have like 62
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.320]   Even the you know, even the neutral bio base that the Layla sells has like I don't know 40 or 50
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.360]   But it only has six and that's what it was like the first thing that just wow
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.280]   It only there's only six and and and it worked it worked really well
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.600]   Right because it passed all the clearances and people are using it and benefiting from it
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:21.560]   And so I was like wow that was that was my first surprise was that was there were so few and then it was basically organic
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:27.840]   Willow bark which as you know is where aspirin comes from organic bomb tea, which is also known as lemon bomb
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:33.760]   And then the frequency of stones, right? Because if you're into Reiki
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.560]   You know, it's all you know all the different rare stones
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.760]   Give off all these incredible and crystals, right?
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.320]   They give off their own frequencies and and so this individual or Sarah
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.700]   I believe her name was Sarah use this frequency of Jade stone and then she included spring water
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.360]   Primal spring water primal salt
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.200]   Which I believe is probably a brand name. I haven't looked it up yet
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:04.960]   And then also she used kana from the kana root and that was it and that harmonic that was created through these six
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:11.920]   Substances was the winning entry out of 70 people. I mean, you know that it's pretty amazing
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.920]   I mean, you know, that's like hitting that's hitting it out of the park when you're competing against that many other entries
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.400]   And so this is what I was like wow this is so cool
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.040]   so what I did was and for my analysis was I enlisted the assistance of
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.320]   AI and so kind of just give you an idea, you know
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:34.640]   If you're doing this type of analysis was I basically just simply and I'll just kind of show you I plugged in the different six
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.760]   You know substances and I asked the AI and and I use three different ones
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.640]   Just to see what the you know answers were
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:48.320]   And basically just said hey, what are the commonalities of benefits from these six substances?
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.560]   And that's what I asked the AI and so here's what Claude said basically
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.560]   It's like, you know, hey, you know, I by now analyze these substances and by the way Claude earlier had told me
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.600]   Hey, you know, I asked it. Hey, can you help me analyze and it said yeah?
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.560]   And it's so it when it analyzes it's looking at, you know, you know, if you give it a list of stuff
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:13.840]   It's looking at chemical structure physical properties functional groups origins uses biological effects chemical react
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.880]   So, you know, so the AI is going to do all that hard work for you
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.880]   All right, so that's kind of my my tip of the day here is, you know, AI is helpful
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:27.840]   And so I kind of ran it through the AI and it basically came out with all of these commonalities between the six different substances
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.120]   And I go out and go over the highlights in a second. So then I checked with co-pilot now co-pilot is
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:41.600]   The one that Microsoft has and so now I asked the same question of co-pilot and co-pilot came out with pretty much the same information
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.960]   Basically it and analyzed each one of them individually though, which was interesting because Claude
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.520]   Kind of just pumped out here are the commonalities whereas and it didn't break it down
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:57.440]   But what co-pilot did was it listed each one individually and said this is what it does
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:03.920]   And your your brain still has to be the one to figure out what the commonality was so co-pilot was not as helpful
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.000]   Um, but it did list the benefits no gem and I which was googles
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:14.640]   Was completely useless in this in this experiment. So if you're going to be doing this in the future and you want to analyze anybody else's
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:20.160]   Uh, then, you know, what I discovered and this was something I learned from this analysis was co-pilot was the best
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:26.080]   Was actually the best AI to use in terms of trying to use something that would help you do an analysis
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.760]   So anyway
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:35.200]   Uh, so this is what it came out with basically this summed it up that the commonalities of the winning entry for the pain management frequency were
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:41.600]   That the substances were of natural origin. They were focused on traditional or alternative medicine
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:46.400]   They had they were they had come herbal components. They were organically certified
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.960]   They had potential wellness applications. They were non pharmaceutical
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:57.840]   Right and they were plant derived substances and there was diverse forms right there was diversity amongst the substances
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.720]   Because in their different forms, right?
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.560]   And then of course the it had they all had or they had
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.480]   Potential mood or cognitive effects. So all of these
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.920]   Points were what was common which is what, you know, when you look at harmonics
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.200]   You want to find the commonalities to create that harmonic
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.800]   And so this is really what was interesting that popped out of what clawhead said about this
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.680]   So now when you take a look at this and you say well, this is what it, you know, this is what it took to win, right?
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.360]   The contest so then if you look at my failed entry and you know and I missed the mark on this
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.560]   I had 29 different things and and i'll show you a spreadsheet that I keep
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.240]   That where I tracked all the different effects and I was trying to hit the mark
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.000]   You know on all the different things that I mentioned in the whole body approach
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.120]   And so I had stuff from all over the map and i'll tell you why
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.400]   In a second, but I had 29 different things
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:59.360]   And and when I pumped that list into clawhead clawed came back and said hey your commonality between your substances
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.080]   But it didn't say that but that's what the response was
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:07.600]   It said hey, you know, this is your substances commonality where they were focused on pain management
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:12.400]   Mood and neurological effects and peptides and growth factors
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:19.520]   Natural compounds because I do try to stay natural as much as I can and there were spicy pungent compounds
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.360]   Which I don't think clawed realize why I put them in I'll explain that in a second
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:29.120]   But they had cognitive effects right there were bioactive and there were diverse routes of administration
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.760]   And that was this is the commonality of what I submitted and this was
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:39.040]   Wrong it was it didn't hit the mark and so i'm thinking wow, you know, so let's take a look
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.120]   At the two so let's take a look at what you know, hey, what is you know?
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.200]   What are the commonalities of winning versus the commonalities of not winning?
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.320]   Okay, and so now so this is my spreadsheet that I kind of keep track of my boosters and just to kind of give you an example like, you know
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:59.520]   I basically, you know, I just this the men's boosters was five separate boosters
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.280]   Combined into one and then there was an eventual breakout because some
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:10.400]   Customers who were asking for a separate one just for testosterone because I broke that one out and then this is the woman's booster
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.480]   Same thing except I swapped out the testosterone one for a wahini
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.880]   Hawaiian for women
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.240]   So women's stuff versus men's stuff and then these are the boosters
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.000]   I've been working on that I'd submit it already and these are my fails
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.760]   These are the ones where I didn't hit the mark
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:31.600]   So like I I'd submitted an energy booster because I wanted something for like, you know, like I just wanted to have a frequency
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:37.120]   That would boost my energy, which is what Layla eventually developed on their own, which they did a completely separate thing
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.200]   Mine didn't work, but they used they create they want they created one that did work
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.640]   Which is called the olympic frequency. I was looking at cardio, you know, like how to help you with your cardio
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:53.760]   And the answer came back where the healer network evaluated my frequency and said the energy booster was not good
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.280]   It made them all kind of like jittery like too much coffee
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:03.680]   And the cardio booster they said it worked, but it was so subtle that it barely they barely felt it
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:09.120]   But then they liked the allergy one. That's how it ended up on for sale. They liked the inflammation one
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.560]   That one worked really well. I did a calm for dogs and this is what's funny
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.920]   You know, the healer network actually tested it out and said it worked, but then they found a better one
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.400]   And I always you know, I'm like egg go for it. You know, obviously
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.040]   So the better one is the calm for animals
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.280]   Uh, so that was so that mine didn't you know, I didn't make the market didn't win that one
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.920]   And then this is my pain management one and i'll talk deep in more in depth than that one
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.160]   But you can kind of see like I just did an ultimate water. I did a grounding
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.640]   Um, and then of course i'm working on different boosters right now just as an fyi
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.800]   I'm looking at something that will help stem cell growth something for cancer support
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:52.240]   Anti-parasitic spike proteins blah blah blah so you can see like, you know, it's kind of like yeah
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.600]   I'm into this and this is what I do. But anyway, let's talk about the pain one
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:01.680]   So now not just commonalities now, let's take a look at the effects of the substances
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.000]   So when I went through the ai responses and I extracted the specific
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:13.440]   Comments within each answer that would kind of define what the effect of as it relates to pain management
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.880]   Of each one of these substances. So kind of let's going down the list here
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:24.000]   The six that sarah had chose were basically one that was focused on pain and river fever reducing
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:33.040]   The next one was a sedative and calming then sus nervous system reduce oxidative stress decrease hypertension
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:40.080]   Anti-inflammatory and antibacterial and euphoric and anxiety reducing so it's like
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.760]   So that was the effect so you're mixing up all of those effects
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.560]   Right derive from substances and she created this harmonic that was
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.360]   Knock out of the park. I mean she just hands down you beat 69 people
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:58.720]   Congratulations, you know who are trying to do the same thing. So that's remarkable
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.960]   But that was her approach and it worked
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:07.120]   So, you know, so when you compare that to now, this is what my approach was and this is where I think you know having
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.640]   You know kind of like a armchair scientist left brain mind
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.960]   Kind of failed me on this one
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:19.200]   Because the first thing I thought of and I know other members had mentioned one other member mentioned that they work in anesthesiology
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.680]   Um, and so they were basically, you know
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.160]   Commenting and that they had used some of the same anesthesia drugs that I had used
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.800]   Uh, because I you know, uh, my daughter is, uh, you know, veterinarian technician
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:36.320]   Uh working in anesthesiology, so I called her up and I'm like, hey, you know, what are you using the
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:41.200]   For your you know for your uh surgeries you're in and so she gave me a list of what she uses
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:47.360]   So this is kind of how I came up with my list, but basically I included seven specific pain medications
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.440]   Some of them are uh for anesthesiology, you know anesthesiology
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:58.320]   Uh drugs and some of them are just pain calming tranquilizers and so forth like trasadone and gabapentin
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.640]   So, you know, but anyway, so I used drugs
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:08.800]   I used hardcore pharmaceutical drugs that will you know that people use in uh surgeries and people prescribe or doctors prescribe
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.400]   So, you know, because I was thinking pain management right well pain management drugs
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.040]   So that's what I put in mind
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:22.000]   Of course, I tried to address the emotional, uh, you know effect because I did by the way I researched every one of these individually
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.760]   To see if they would fit so this took a long time
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.560]   But I researched it I researched every single one
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:36.480]   Individually, so as I was researching pain management, um, you know the shamanic aspect of pain management came up
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.880]   And so I thought okay, let's let's use the psilocybin
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.600]   Uh from from from a shamanic
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:47.920]   Effect and of course I got into the peptides are all healing peptides and these are all the specific peptides
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.080]   There's uh, what's six of them that address pain and inflammation
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:59.280]   And then also I got into getting into over-the-counter stuff and then also then getting into
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.040]   um
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:07.280]   Supplements that really reduce pain. All right, so that's when I looked at willow bark and ginger and Boswellia and peppermint
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.640]   So I was looking at the different supplements not just the drugs or peptides
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.240]   But also looked at supplements natural stuff that would then
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.080]   Uh, you know help, you know as an external force help with pain management
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.560]   And then when I got into the internal force, which was when you look at
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:29.440]   And you do the research and you say hey, you know, how does the body react to pain?
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.480]   And the body will produce endorphins and the endorphins as your natural bodies way
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.520]   Of managing pain and so I thought and I kind of went overkill here. I think I did what?
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.600]   Eight of these and I added eight separate endorphin stimulating uh substances
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:52.560]   And so one of the big endorphin stimulating and substances that is kind of what's interesting in the research that I didn't know
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.120]   Which were a hot peppers
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.760]   Hot things, you know food wise super spicy
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.680]   So I added in wasabi and ghost pepper and carolina reaper
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.880]   I put those frequencies in in my entry
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.840]   And then of course cacao, lflanine b vitamins and ginkgo biloba
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.480]   So but that's kind of my approach. So this was my whole body approach
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:17.120]   That completely failed
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:22.640]   And so what's great though is now you can go well, this is what worked
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.400]   This is what didn't work
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.840]   So what are some of the possible findings that we could kind of learn from this?
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.320]   Which is the point of my video and by the way, everybody who enters the next one
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.400]   I you know kudos to you for making the effort and and you know you go
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.960]   Uh, and I hope you all win
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.960]   Oh, you know, hope the greatest one wins and and kudos to whoever does that
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.040]   So but here are the commonalities
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.240]   That when I took a look at my summary, you know
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.400]   So after looking at all of the data looking at everything that, you know
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.920]   My little friend claud helped me with looking at all of the stuff that I did
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.840]   Compared to what sarah did and said hey, you know what this is at the end of the day
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.920]   This is my summary of findings on making harmonics going forward
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.760]   Because now I you know, I really this is a great learning opportunity
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.400]   And that's why I want to share it with all of you, right?
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.160]   So the very first one is that I need to approach this research
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.960]   I need to approach the actual research with my feeling brain and not my thinking brain
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:23.120]   I put way too much thinking into it and not only did I do it that way
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:28.080]   I put way too much left brain scientific, you know, alopathy, you know
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.760]   Healer kind of mentality into the idea of pain
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.720]   Management and and I because I just think I overthought it so i'm thinking oh, okay
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.880]   This is good to know now I going forward I start approaching the research
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.840]   From my feeling brain not the thinking one, right?
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.920]   The next one was keeping everything natural and organic obviously
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.480]   It is not natural organic to use an anesthesiology drug
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:58.000]   Or use naproxen sodium or using gabapentin and all that so it's just like don't do that
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.680]   You know, I mean I just really feel now
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:04.640]   It's like if the winning pain management frequency did not have any of that crap in it
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.720]   Then I'm not using that going forward
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.960]   So I've now kind of just you know created something in my head that I'm not doing that
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.280]   That that is that's probably that's not the way to go
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.760]   Right because we're trying to do
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.120]   We're trying to do this naturally and organically, right? That's what's best for us
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.520]   So, you know, the body knows, right?
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:27.200]   And so now using traditional or or alternative medicine following that path
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.120]   Through you know with the research and figuring out what the different substances could be
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.440]   Uh, and then of course diversifying the effects as you saw in the spreadsheet
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:41.280]   You know, there was effects for everything from everything from anxiety to anti-inflammatory to pain to neurological
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.400]   So, you know, Sarah did this great job of mixing up the effects
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:50.080]   I feel I did a great job mixing up effects, but I think just whether they were the wrong effects
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.640]   So, Sarah kudos to you
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.320]   Okay, and then the next one too is she you know, she included something I want to point out
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:01.040]   Was a foundational support for health and so when she put in spring water
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:07.360]   When actually when I first saw this list and I saw spring water and salt question mark question mark question mark
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.920]   Like how in the world is that in the pain management frequency and then when I did the research
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:18.320]   I realized oh that was the internal force because what these two do right right here what spring water
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.920]   Right, it's minerals and what is salt minerals, but salt also has an incredible critical
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:29.200]   Property of you know sustaining our health. So that was like brilliant Sarah
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.480]   Brilliant to include that because I didn't even thought of that
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.320]   And then the last thing was you know, the final bullet that I want to share with you
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.840]   For you to think about as you guys work on your own
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:43.840]   For the next contest would be that less may be best
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.960]   You know instead of 35 or whatever
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:53.280]   29 different, you know, maybe maybe just having one substance per effect
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:58.640]   Which is what Sarah did may be the best way to approach it. So there you go guys
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.800]   I just wanted to share my analysis
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.120]   Because you know, it's a first time ever being able to have you know had the opportunity to do it
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.760]   And and learn from it. And so that's kind of what I want to do is share it with you
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.560]   Try this out for the next contest. I'm definitely going to be competing in there with you
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.480]   I don't really care if I win or not. I think this is just a great
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.280]   Thing that we're doing because we're literally creating the best of the best
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.400]   And knowing that you know, that's going to be available
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.680]   Through quantum upgrade or you know for us to be able to get a hold of it is is remarkable
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.560]   So now, you know, it's like, you know with these contests now
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.200]   I'm just really excited and I think and I just wish everybody well and good luck on winning the contest
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:43.600]   So now, uh, thank you and I really appreciate
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:49.040]   You guys watching the videos and the kind comments and I just you know, I I really enjoy
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:53.520]   Interacting with all of you guys and just want to say thanks. Thanks for watching my videos
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.080]   And if you like this kind of stuff like and subscribe, right?
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.840]   And that way you guys can keep up with all that crazy stuff I come up with now
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.160]   If you want to learn more about me what I do frequency stuff blah blah all that stuff
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:10.160]   You can find me at my blog. You just type in tinker's dot academy in the url window of your browser
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.240]   It goes straight to my blog. Also. I have a telegram health and healing group
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.400]   Where we talk about
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:22.160]   Everything you can imagine under the under the umbrella of health healing longevity and performance
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.840]   And so that's kind of where we go
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.760]   And you can find me there as well and you also can find me in the in the two quantum groups
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.840]   So, uh, there you go. So hey, thanks a lot for watching. I hope you found this interesting
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.720]   Hope, uh, and then you know, good luck on the next contest. Have a great day. A lot
