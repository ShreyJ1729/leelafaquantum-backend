[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinker's Academy video. I'm your host, Kay Elmer and this
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.960]   video is a tutorial on how to subscribe to the trauma easy service as well as how to acquire
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.400]   the app that runs on your phone that goes with the service. Now, this is one of three tutorials
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.120]   for trauma easy and this one only covers how to subscribe and get the app. Now, to actually use
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.040]   trauma easy for trauma release and also how to use it for, you know, charging food and water,
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.840]   there's another tutorial called how to use trauma easy and there'll be a link to that
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.600]   tutorial in the video description below. Now, there's two other features that run off of the app and
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.400]   so that one has its own tutorial called how to use travel and Vax harmonizer and that tutorial
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.280]   itself will be there's a link in the video description for that tutorial. So keep in mind that there's
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.600]   three basic steps. One is you got to subscribe and get the app. Number two, learn how to use it to
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.200]   release trauma. And then two or three actually, sorry, how do you know, you know, how to use
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.120]   the app to activate the travel and Vax harmonizer feature. So kind of give you an overview real quick
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.480]   is that trauma easy is a quantum service you subscribe to which uses your phone as a quantum
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.600]   device. So it automatically just starts running on your phone. Now, the four features that I mentioned
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.640]   earlier, there's the first two which is trauma release and charging food and water. That's using
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.640]   your phone to do that. Now that automatically activates upon subscription and it just runs
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.960]   continually. Okay, so once you subscribe, that one's are just running and you just need to learn
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.360]   how to use it. Okay, the other two features are called travel and Vax harmonizer. And that one,
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.840]   those two features requires the smartphone app and it runs when you manually activated. Okay,
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.120]   so there's four features, they're kind of broken up into two little groups. And once we're gonna run
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.920]   automatically and then one's going to run when you turn them on, but it's not just about turning
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.320]   them on, you know, it's it's about how do you use it when it's turned on. So again, I want to
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.600]   point out there's another tutorial called how to use trauma easy and another tutorial how to use
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.200]   travel and Vax. So there's three tutorials for this service just to keep it clear. So now getting
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.520]   back to how to subscribe, very simple, you just go to the trauma easy website. So if you remember
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.760]   from the front page here, this is the website link. Of course, the link will be in the video
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.080]   description, but it's simply trauma easy.laq.com. And once you go to that site, your very first step
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.120]   is simply to subscribe. So there's a sign me up button right here on the front page. And once
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.080]   you click that, you're presented with two separate plans. Now you can go with the single one person,
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.280]   you know, subscriptions $20 a month, or you can go with the family subscription,
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.400]   which is up to five separate people for $30 a month. So once you decide on what your plan is,
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.360]   now this is what happens when you click on single subscription, you just see it right here explains
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.520]   what it is, and you enter your phone number. And what's really important about entering your phone
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.000]   number is you need to enter it in the format as shown. So you want to do the plus country code
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.840]   dash area code dash seven digit number. Okay. And then you would click subscribe. So this is for
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.080]   single. And this is for family. So that would be your step three is now you've selected your plan.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.000]   And now at this point, you want to add your phone numbers that you want to sign up for this service.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.040]   And you would enter them into these five fields. So there's phone number 12345. And then you would
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.720]   go ahead and click on the button right here that would say subscribe. So once you've entered your
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.520]   numbers, and you've you basically click subscribe, then what you're going to get is going to say,
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.760]   hey, family or single subscription has been added to your cards, you'll get the confirmation message.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.120]   And it'll be now in your cart ready for you to go ahead and pay i.e. check out. So now once
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.040]   you're ready to go and check out, you click on that little checkout button, your cart button.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.120]   And then at this point, you're going to get a summary. This is your cart, like any other
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.120]   online service. It's going to list the five numbers. You want to double check one more time
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.440]   that you got the numbers correctly, because it's real important. And then once you're ready to go
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.080]   ahead and pay, you go ahead and click proceed to check out. Now, the one thing I do want to mention
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:23.040]   about TROM EZ is that there's that first monthly payment you would pay. Plus, there's a $35 set
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.000]   of fee that's just flat out. So that's going to. So that's why you see right here at 65. It's 30
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   plus 35. Right. So here's your $30 a month plus the 35 set of fee. Okay. So then you go ahead and
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.440]   press and you would click on proceed to check out. And then it just goes to your typical billing,
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.800]   you know, page. So right here is your billing details, your name, your address, your phone number,
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   your phone number for the, you know, the contact for the billing. And of course,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.280]   your credit card information. And once you go ahead and process all of that and click,
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.240]   you know, submit, you know, place my order, you know how it goes, then you've been confirmed. And
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.640]   then you'll get this order details page right here that says, Hey, you've now been subscribed.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.000]   It says, thank you. Your order has been received. And it'll tell you what day you started. And of
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.520]   course, it'll tell you right down here. The next time you're going to be charged, you know, for
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.120]   your subscription. So now you've confirmed, and you can actually log into Trom EZ on the website.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.400]   So if you see this little icon up here in the right corner, you can now log into Trom EZ. So
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.040]   the thing about Trom EZ, unlike Quantum Upgrade, where Quantum Upgrade Service has a dashboard and
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.640]   allows you to modify and change stuff and customize your experience with Trom EZ because it's always
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.080]   just running. There's really not any of that. So you'll see the typical dashboard here with your
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.560]   choices here. And your mainly, it's just, if you want to check your subscription to see, you know,
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.200]   just to validate what you just subscribe to, then you click on my subscription, and you're going to
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.480]   get your standard information that you would need when you started your last order date,
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.200]   when your next payments do and so forth. You can actually change payment right here. Like if you
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.880]   started with one credit card, you want to switch to another credit card, that sort of thing. And
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.520]   it's going to list, basically, tell you what your subscription totals are. And that's really it.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.600]   It's all about billing. So the Trom EZ Harmonizer website, when you log in, is only about billing.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.760]   Okay, because this service has automatically started within 15 minutes once you've paid.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.960]   And that's it. That's how you subscribe the Trom EZ Harmonizer. Of course, again, one more
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.280]   time. If you want to learn how to use it once it's turned on, then go and check out the
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.840]   tutorial for how to use it. Now, the next part, again, is the app. Now you're going to need the
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.920]   app if you want to use the travel and Vax Harmonizer feature. So again, step one to use the app. And
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:46.960]   this is important. You have to, you know, sign up on the website, then get the app. Okay, so step one
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.720]   to use the app is to subscribe to Trom EZ from the website, as I just showed. And then the next thing
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.240]   you want to do is on your phone, you want to download the Trom EZ app. Now you can get it off the Google
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.680]   Play Store or the Apple Store, and you just search on the word Trom EZ. And it'll come right up.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.440]   You download it. And this is what it's going to look like when you turn it on. Okay, so this is
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.360]   your little front page right here. So the first thing you want to do when you get the app up and
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.400]   running on your phone is step three, is you want to log into the Trom EZ app. And that's to activate
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.440]   those two other features as you want to, because they're just going to run when you want, when you
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.400]   turn them on manually. And so first thing here is enter the phone number of the subscribe phone.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.880]   And what's really important here is this little part right here, the country code has been converted
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.800]   into a down, you know, like basically a drop down list. So you would just select your country.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.200]   Okay, and it's going to enter the number for you. And then in the phone number field here,
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   you just would air enter your area code and phone number. Okay, you don't need to put in the country
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.920]   code, because the app does that for you. So just select your correct country code,
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.920]   type in the number that you subscribe to. And this is for any one of the numbers that you had
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.880]   subscribed to. So you and the other four family members, right? So whatever phone numbers you have
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.480]   subscribed, you would just type it in, and then go ahead and click log in. Now once you have a log
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.120]   in, you've got you presented with just the two options. It's a very, very simple app. And you
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.600]   just need to choose, okay, well, which one do I want to try? Do I want to try the travel feature or
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.120]   the Vax, you know, harmonizer feature? So the right here is the two different, you know,
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.240]   options travel and Vax harmonizer. And then right here, it says learn more. If you click on learn more,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.280]   it'll give you the instructions on how to use it. Okay, which, you know, we're also creating a
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.600]   tutorial for that as well to help you along. So basically, you decide which one you want,
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.480]   and you go ahead and click on it. Now, if you click on travel, you're going to see this little green
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.920]   check right here that says, hey, you just turned it on, and it's going to run for 12 hours nonstop.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.840]   Okay, and you're going to get a little note here that says your service for the amazing travel
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:56.480]   is activated. Okay, now if you decide to activate Vax harmonization, same thing,
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.600]   you click on this icon, the little green check starts up and it says, hey, you've now, you know,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:07.040]   your service for a fax harmonization is now activated. And so you're running, whichever one
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:13.280]   has a green check, and it's going to run, Vax activated is going to run for 30 minutes straight. Okay,
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.600]   and that's during those 30 minutes is when you would want to go through the steps, just like you
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.560]   would do for the trauma release. Now you're using the Vax harmonizer process, and you go through
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.680]   those steps. And again, one more time, those steps on how to use the travel and Vax harmonizer
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:34.560]   features are in the tutorial. You know, that's the link in the video description below. Or if you
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.880]   want to just go ahead and click on the learn more, it'll actually give you the instructions on how to
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:44.640]   use either one of these services. So that's how you subscribe. That's how you use the app, you know,
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.440]   I mean, in terms of accessing the app. And then the rest of it will be in the other two tutorials,
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.920]   depending on which feature you're you're wanting to work with. All right, so that's it. Thank you
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.000]   very much for watching the video. Hope this was helpful. If you want to learn more over at Tinkers.
