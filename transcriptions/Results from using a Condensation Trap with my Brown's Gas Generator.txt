[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.940]   right internet peeps follow-up on the condensation trap experiment
[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.340]   over a week I think at least a week or something
[00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.620]   that I've been running and I use this Monday through Friday solid
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.620]   as I'm sitting on my desk all day so that gives you kind of like
[00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.860]   about six hours minimum per day five days a week
[00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.220]   so anyway so I've had this thing set up and the whole idea is this concentration
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.820]   trap is supposed to trap condensation and as you can see there is absolutely
[00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.300]   nothing in the trap but if you follow the
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:45.340]   cannula you can see condensation whoop try to get a better zoom on that and yep
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:52.540]   there doesn't seem to be any difference at all sorry it's really hard to focus on
[00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.420]   on the cannula trying to get a good focus you for you guys I'm trying to there you
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.660]   go so yeah I've still got fluid there's a lot of condensation it actually goes
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.740]   all the way down this is a seven foot cannula you can see so I'm about three
[00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.420]   feet from me two feet for sorry about the filming this is really bad but it's
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.740]   hard okay so yeah there's pretty much quite a bit of condensation in the
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.860]   cannula so I would say that this is a poor use of whole two dollars worth of
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.220]   your money yeah there's no real no real difference save your money guys didn't
