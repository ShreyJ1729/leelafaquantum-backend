[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.560]   Kayama and in this video I'd like to share with you a wonderful discussion I
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.720]   had today with Philip von Holzendorf of Leila Quantum Tech about their newest
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.280]   product that was released today called the Leila Quantum Block. For those of you
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.720]   who are familiar with Leila products, this is the device that creates other
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.880]   products. So for those of you who are new to the concept of quantum energy
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.320]   devices, I kind of just want you to know that I broke the discussion into two
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.800]   parts. The very first half of our discussion really centers around what is
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.600]   this energy? What does it do? How is it different than other types of quantum
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.040]   energy devices on the market and really wanted to dive into how you know like
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.200]   what is the validation of for the claims that are made about what it can do? And
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.880]   so Philip was gracious enough to kind of walk through each one of those ideas
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.220]   and really explain it so that everybody who's sort of new to this idea that
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.120]   an a simple object could contain energy and could also emit frequencies that could
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.880]   be positive for your health and well-being. It's kind of a different concept that a
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.200]   lot of people are not used to so this discussion the first half really sort of
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.640]   lays the foundation to kind of understand you know what these products are all
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.760]   about and what they can do and how they can help you. Now the second half is
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.160]   really just kind of a user's instruction on okay if you had a quantum block what
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.560]   would you do with it and how would you use it and how would you create other
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.680]   devices from it and that sort of thing. And then and then of course we covered
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.160]   what do you do when you've got other devices you've already purchased from
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.640]   different types of vendors and different types of items like everything from
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.040]   crystals to you know tensor coils you know and that sort of thing and what
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.040]   would you do if you already had those items and how could you enhance them and
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.960]   how could you actually make them better for your overall well-being and your
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.720]   health. So it's pretty interesting conversation it is those two halves for
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.600]   those of you are just interested in like hey what's the product and how do I use
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.760]   it versus you want to understand because you're new to this and I think that first
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.040]   half would be really really helpful for you. Overall we had a great discussion I
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.120]   mean I just never ran out of questions in talking with Philip about this new
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.080]   product and just the overall concept of the quantum energy you know industry or
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.000]   you know the space. So without further ado I'm going to go ahead and jump right
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.480]   into the interview and again I just want to say thank you for stopping by thank
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.600]   you for your time and your interest in in these videos and in the content that I
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.320]   provide and especially thank you Philip for your time this morning I really
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.960]   enjoyed our conversation. So Aloha thank you very much and here's the
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.480]   interview. Aloha everyone and welcome to another video I am your host Kay Elmer and
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.520]   I have the wonderful opportunity to have Philip Von Holtzendorf with me who is the
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.520]   owner operator of Leila Quantum Tech. This is our fourth interview that we've
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.120]   had because I've been covering the launch of his new product line and his new
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.560]   business. He's also one of our our dearly beloved C60 characters who's been with
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.240]   us for a long time and but he started a new business last year and I've been
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.880]   just kind of following him and I wanted to share some more developments. Now Philip
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.600]   welcome and let's just kind of show everybody you know who we're who we're
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.280]   talking to. This is Philip Von Holtzendorf. Philip did you want to kind of
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.200]   introduce yourself from the Leila Quantum Tech perspective? Yes thank you for
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.640]   having me and Kay I'm looking forward to the interview and yeah most people
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.920]   probably know a little bit about my background so I'll be very brief today.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.640]   So you know I'm from Germany originally live in the US with my family and yeah
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.200]   have a few business ventures that are all geared towards providing something
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.160]   new absolutely cutting edge that's helpful to humanity and it sounds pretty
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.360]   big but you know obviously something big can be also small and starts also
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.560]   small and you know we're here talking about Leila Quantum Tech. Leila
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:25.120]   Quantum Tech works with its own technology to charge various products
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.880]   with various frequencies that are very helpful for humans or for animals or for
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.080]   plants with different different kinds of frequencies that we actually have
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.600]   developed together with a healer network with some healers that are extremely
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.200]   special and well known and well regarded all over the world and also
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.840]   with quantum energy. So yeah and they're the different purposes for these
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.000]   products you can use them in various ways in general they promote health they
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.760]   provide energy they help to tap into more into who we truly are and yeah that
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.840]   in a nutshell is kind of what we do it's very exciting and looking forward to
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.140]   talking a little bit about yeah the new product that we offer now which is not
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:28.320]   really a new product it's just now it's finally available to offer.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:36.120]   Alright so just kind of paraphrase Leila Quantum Tech is your new venture you
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.920]   also have a business with C60 products but your Leila Quantum Tech is an
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:48.680]   energy product that that supports the human bio field basically and and in
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.920]   some ways attenuates with it which is we'll get into that and then but you're
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.120]   not just a one person coming up with your own ideas like I was showing why
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.200]   you're talking there's this actual healer network and so these healers are all
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.640]   people around the world that have come together and kind of work together that
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.000]   put together the ideas behind the products and and the frequencies that
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.760]   you've come up with the products you've come up with so you've got all these
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.760]   different people and so it's a consortium of energy workers right with
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.240]   that yes you describe it and people that are in the wellness and health
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.360]   community they've been doing it for decades I mean what would you say of the
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.920]   combined number of years of experience of people working with for
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.080]   wellness and healing of other people around the world is probably over a
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.800]   hundred years of experience right here so that's all together has come together
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.400]   to form Leila Q and the products that that you come up with so I just kind of
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.720]   wanted to point that out for anyone that's new to Leila Q that it's that is
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.680]   very very special one of the things to I also want to kind of point out Leila
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.240]   Q is at Leila Q dot com and Phillips the owner operator and we've done three
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.560]   other videos so I'll link them in the video description below for people would
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.600]   like more information we did one interview right when the Leila Q was
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.800]   launched so it kind of discusses the background behind the products and there
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.080]   was one video that I really highly recommend which is the test results of
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.240]   all of the different products they were tested third-party two different
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.920]   institutions and we walk through the different test results and so this is
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.360]   what's really quite unique was I kind of I personally have been involved in in
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.320]   energy products as well as bio electrical magnetics and C60 for quite
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.400]   a long time and so I own a whole bunch of different little things like purple
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.760]   plates and tensor coils and I did organize for a long while and and all of
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:47.000]   those kinds of things to kind of like explore the concept of energy and I got
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.840]   to say that for me personally this is one of the most amazing devices or you
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.600]   know product lines that come out because I have quite a few and and it
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.360]   really approaches it from a different standpoint so I kind of am really amazed
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.280]   by this and I just suggest that anyone that has any interest at all you know
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.600]   just you know spend some time on it but what's most important of the point I
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.280]   want to make is that when we went through the test results you know it's
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:17.760]   it's so far out there that I've looked at it's the only real quantum energy type
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.560]   of product that actually has test results like you look at some of these other
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.240]   results that just and you know I don't want to single anybody out but they
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.360]   don't have test results they haven't third-party somebody else tests these
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.280]   things and says hey what does it do to the human bio field what does it do to
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.400]   the bioinogenics of a person what does it do to their height or heart rate
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.800]   variability when you have it and you don't have it and the results were
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.720]   amazing so I do highly recommend anyone that's interested in the science or the
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.640]   actual like what really happens because I know there's a lot of people out there
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.560]   that are so adamantly interested in like okay what is it really really do
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.600]   well what does it really really do go take a look at that video about the test
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.560]   results and then the other third video that we did was about the different
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.680]   frequencies that Layla offers so the lot of background on that and it's all
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.680]   there I'll have the links there in the below but so today though today's special
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.840]   because Philip you've launched a new product now and we're gonna talk about
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.800]   that and so that product is called the Layla Quantum Block and that's what it
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.960]   looks like so how would you describe this new product that you've got I mean
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:27.920]   like what is it and what does it do yeah so the Layla Quantum Block is
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.600]   basically the underlying technology that we use in order to charge the
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.920]   products and we're now also making it available so one of the reasons why we
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.840]   couldn't start you know two months ago is because we certainly worked on making
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.400]   it look not not just energetically fit right you know that that was what we
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:55.080]   already have had for quite some time but it needed to look great we wanted to
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.520]   make it look in a way that it fits pretty much in everyone's home as a as a
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.560]   beautiful device not just energy wise but that also looks nice that it's very
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.120]   functional that's not too big not too small and all of that and obviously if
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.200]   you then offer it you know each one needs to look like the other one and that's
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:22.800]   kind of what we have done and now we're finally ready we put information on the
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:29.360]   website and what it is it's it's basically a tool on a technology that
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:35.160]   provides a concentrated quantum energy space right in between those two plates
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.680]   that people can see now right so in there there's a concentrated quantum
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.520]   energy space it's not just the quantum energy feel it's truly a space because
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:53.800]   it's it's fully multi-dimensional and it works completely without any
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:01.000]   electricity or without any magnets both of which are actually limited
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:10.160]   limiting and disturbing to a quantum energy space so that being said what can
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.280]   you do with it so first of all you can just put it in your home and just by not
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.800]   putting anything in or doing anything with it it already does a whole lot for
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.760]   you at home it's sort of like an energetic feng shui that it does
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:30.920]   automatically so it provides a very nice and harmonious energy field it's
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:36.920]   important also the harmonious part because it actually interacts extremely
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:42.000]   well with the human cells and the human energy system certainly also with animals
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.200]   and all that but it's it's extremely harmonious that's one of the things that
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:56.040]   people say about it and it has a radius of about 40 meters 40 to 45 meters I
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:06.920]   think in in feats that that's maybe around 130 145 feet I think and it not
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:12.960]   only is this energetic feng shui it really it optimized and harmonized this
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:19.040]   emf which we all have in our homes obviously through Wi-Fi microwave or
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:28.520]   now 5g and all of that and you mentioned the study so we've also done a study for
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.400]   the quantum block specifically it's unfortunately it's not up on the website
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:38.160]   yet because we're still waiting to to get the the results back in writing but
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.360]   we have them verbally already and yeah it's it's absolutely amazing some of the
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:50.200]   tests that that have been done and how quickly it really promotes health and
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:55.460]   well-being frankly for anyone in the home so we we tested a specific home
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:13:01.200]   where there was a couple they had a cat and they had a rabbit and and all of
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.880]   those people including the rabbit and the cat and all of them were tested
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:11.040]   beforehand they were tested after the quantum block was in the home and they
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.800]   were actually also tested once the quantum book was taken out of the the
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:23.240]   home again and the results are really fantastic we've done other tests I'm not
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.480]   gonna go too much into them because we maybe want to talk about those results
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.880]   well once we have them also in writing and can can refer to them but I want to
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.960]   point out one thing so that was actually that the testing Institute had the
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:45.320]   impulse to to analyze snow so they had gotten a lot of snow recently and then
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.240]   they were like well you know we know about a chemtrails we know about you
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.840]   know other things that are really not that good for the environment and so they
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:14:00.600]   analyze the the snow and they found all this the hat stuff it had aluminum and
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:07.240]   zinc and all that kind of stuff and then they put the snow in the quantum block
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.840]   and after that all those harmful frequencies were gone and neutralized so
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:18.840]   yeah I think in a nutshell I stopped here that's how I would explain it it's
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:24.880]   very hard to explain with words some of the things it does because it's truly
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:33.120]   incredible it's it's not earthbound at all it it doesn't interact you know on
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:42.280]   the magnetic side and yeah it's yeah that's that's how I can explain it with
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:46.840]   words well let me I want to point out a couple of things is that if you go to
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.960]   Leila Q site and you click on this little menu one of the things that you
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.880]   will see right here is research studies and certificates so for those of you
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.600]   folks who really want to look at the science and the science that Philip's
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:04.040]   describing is essentially bio-energetics and heart rate variability and these are
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:09.160]   like you know known methodologies by which you measure a person's response to
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:15.000]   an external stimuli so what really is being described here is measuring a
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.400]   person without a you know a stimulus whether it's EMF or a toxin or whatever
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:26.440]   and then measuring their biological responses to that stimulus before and
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:31.760]   after so you're saying Philip that just by taking this device and putting it in
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:35.800]   someone's home that that the person and all the different living beings in that
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:41.320]   home actually have a positive biological response as opposed to without it right
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.560]   I mean like absolutely like there are five on a scale of one to ten 10s good
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.960]   I'm just making that up just as an example but and you put this thing in
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.000]   that they're actually going to get better that it actually promotes wellness
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.720]   right absolutely wellness and it has actually also in the at least where we
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:04.920]   tested it it also helped with better sleep and rest because one thing to
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:11.160]   say about this is it's not an artificial energy pusher if you will it is it is
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.840]   really harmonious so it really adapts extremely well with your bio energetic
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:24.720]   field or the one of a cat or dog rabbit whatever and yeah so so that's also why
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:31.640]   you know if you it has a lot of concentrated quantum energy right it has
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:38.080]   a lot more quantum energy concentrated in there than any other device on the
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:44.600]   market by far in large frankly and you know people may think okay well if it's
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:50.560]   so strong so you know how how can I then deal with it do I have to adapt to it
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.960]   am I gonna be thrown out a balance and no that's actually not the case because
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:04.320]   it it is so harmonious that even you if you live in a home and you've you've had
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.200]   your quantum block around for two three weeks and and all that now you have
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:12.680]   suddenly a visitor come over that has never heard anything about energy work
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.000]   where it has never been close to quantum energy or anything it's just a
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:26.520]   random normal person he will not have any that that visitor will not have any
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:31.480]   issues whatsoever with energy of the quantum block frankly the opposite will
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:37.680]   be the case they'll also feel this harmony and so I think that's that's
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:43.920]   worth mentioning okay I think the thing for folks that have that are new or have
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:49.120]   not heard of these types of devices is here's the concept I know that it looks
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:55.800]   like two metal plates and four rods that's what it looks like but that the
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:02.800]   metal the the object that itself has been charged with an energy and I guess
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:08.640]   the for those of you who are into the science aspect of it you know you might
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.320]   be familiar with the studies and experiments that have been done with
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.280]   consciousness so that and that scientists have then have now proven that
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.520]   there is an actual energy being measured in when when people are
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:27.160]   concentrating and it's their what they're calling conscious energy there's also
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.520]   the idea of scalar energy right there's also the idea of quantum energy at the
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:37.320]   quantum space right so there's all these different words for energy that is not
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.520]   something you can pick up magnetically or electrically and and so that's what
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:47.520]   this is this is a an energy force that is is known to science but never
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:53.320]   quantified there's no meter for it except the human body you can actually measure
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.720]   the effect of the energy but not the energy itself is that safe to save
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:03.960]   Philip because it's it's hard I think that yeah that's a great explanation and I
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:09.840]   want to add to that something that you wouldn't find in the book of if you you
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:16.000]   know read about this type of of energy but if you now imagine that you close
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.320]   your eyes and you you tap into your own energy field then you try to expand
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:26.880]   out and you kind of connect like if for example in a deep meditation right and
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.760]   then you kind of feel the energy around you and you can you can almost call that
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:41.520]   in and and almost inhale more of it right so that's that type of energy and
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:47.120]   that's the closest that thing I can provide right now as as form of a
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:53.680]   picture that that you can sense that and not out of artificial at all yeah
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.560]   that's kind of like that so I've struggled to try to figure out how to
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.760]   explain this to to folks that are you know kind of like more leaning towards
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:06.320]   the academia type of approach to to how things are and you know the whole rule
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.560]   of if you can't measure it right there's that rule in science but this is
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.320]   something that you can measure and I think you can measure it if you look at it
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.320]   from the standpoint of what's the effect of it as opposed to measuring it
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.600]   directly and it's it is very hard to wrap your hand around I mean it took me a
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.520]   while you know even though I've been dabbling in this kind of stuff for quite
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.520]   a long time you know like what you know is this is you know what is this energy
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.400]   and and so that's kind of what I want to point out because it looks so simple
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.360]   but yet it's so powerful and and I'm speaking from personal experience so
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:44.160]   okay so we're we're talking about this object as you're calling it the quantum
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:49.200]   you know the cube block right and so the and you're saying that this is like
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.520]   you literally this is what you're using in your your factory or your you know
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.640]   your development process so you're putting raw material into this little
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:04.640]   cube thing this little block and then and then you just leave it in there
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.400]   and then you take it out and and it so what's unique about it right is it's not
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:13.600]   only a energy device but it also creates other energy devices that's correct right
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:19.600]   that is absolutely correct and you know certainly we also use much larger models
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:26.400]   you know for some of the products that they you know it's it's hard if you want to
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:35.200]   charge a hundred hoodies and you know it's so so we do have a larger model and
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:44.320]   then we also have the infinity block won't go really much into that but at
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.920]   least want to mention that because most of our products are charged in the
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:54.480]   two-way process and so they they are charged in the quantum block or quantum
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:00.320]   block type right and then they'll get an extra charge in the infinity block
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.880]   and what that does I'll explain it at a different time but it adds
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:13.920]   yeah even more benefits than to the products okay so that's kind of how it works and by the way
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:21.040]   so I think what's what's important to tell people is you know you see how big this is
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:30.160]   it's it's actually eight by eight by eight inch and you could remove actually up to three of those
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:42.400]   rods and then fit an object in that is a little bit weirdly shaped as an example just I want to
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:48.800]   point that out and then also what's what's great with this is you can you cannot see it here really
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:55.520]   but if you were to zoom in the picture you could see that on the top there are these I don't even
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:03.120]   know how you call them it's interesting and in German we call them mothers and you can unscrew
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:12.960]   them and then you can take the upper plate off and then you can take those five meters away those
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:21.120]   plates and you still have a fully functional field in between so you can easily charge your car with
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:28.800]   it if you wanted to right the old car doesn't fit in so you would have to do parts right but you
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:35.440]   can you can take the plates away easily five meters and you'll still have a perfect field in there
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:44.800]   and one way to do is just to you know put it vertically on the on the sides on the floor for
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:52.960]   example that would be one thing and then you could put um you know any large long object or a thick
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:59.840]   object in between and then charge it if you want okay and do you want me to talk about the charging
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.920]   in general because we said okay what does it do if it's in the home just sitting there right um
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.880]   yeah I kind of wanted to just cover like what is the energy and I think we've covered that and
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.280]   then how to know that it's working I do want to point out a couple of things that Philip has done
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:19.040]   like and by the way there's a telegram chat group called quantum power where we talk about this
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:24.240]   energy and the products what they can do and you got questions about the products so you know I'm
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.800]   put the link below so come on in there if you got any questions at all everyone is welcome to
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:33.280]   join in on the discussion and one of the things though that Philip was kind of just showing us that
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.640]   you could actually do at home is the cut flower experiment I mean if you really want to know like
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:44.480]   oh is this like is this like hocus pocus or you know is this real then the simplest the simplest
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:49.200]   thing you could do is go to your store your local grocery store get some fresh carnations
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:56.160]   right take split the split the bouquet put half in one vase and with water and half in the other
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:01.440]   vase with water and then charge one of them and then using one of these or even using one of the
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:07.840]   little capsules that lay like you cells um and you will find out one hundred percent of the time
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:12.800]   that whatever you charge the flowers in that vase will last longer than the other ones and it's
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:19.120]   just like it's somehow this whole conscious energy versus scalar versus quantum versus life force
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:24.720]   energy but this energy promotes life it promotes health and wellness and you will see what it does
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.360]   to a cut flower and I think that's the simplest way right Philip for people just to say hey is this
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:34.880]   working or what does it do yep now that's definitely one uh one thing too for people to
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:39.520]   simply have something they can watch and look at really what you can also do is just put your
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:45.680]   hand in it for example uh and feel what it does with your hand um immediately you know the the
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:54.000]   cells will um get get a boost and uh it's that's that's pretty fascinating and you could you know
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.360]   sit down in meditation put your hand in and then see if you can get deeper into it as one example
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:07.040]   um yeah but those are a few things you can do pretty quickly and rapidly to to feel okay so
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:12.480]   yeah I just want to kind of point out that and um the other thing that like for what I do is you
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:17.520]   know I'm a dowser I don't know for those of you who are familiar with dowsing that is an ancient
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:23.360]   art and it has been around so for so long with humanity I don't know nobody knows when it started
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:30.160]   but dowsing is the ability for someone to just tie into energy fields uh using wire rods or
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:35.280]   pendulums okay and it's it's very well established that it works anybody who's ever been on a farm
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.520]   and you know you've seen your grandfather your father go find where the well is supposed to be
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:46.080]   dug uh using dowsing and also to find negativity and uh negativity spaces and energy in any type
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:54.080]   of environment so when I got I got a cue block and I immediately dowsed it and it was it was off
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:59.520]   the the energy was was off the chart coming off of this thing it was amazing as opposed to an empty
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.240]   space with nothing around it so uh so yeah I could you could tell by dowsing as well if you're a
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:11.440]   dowser okay so um so we talked about the device itself and um and you mentioned that this is one
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.000]   of two so it's the first one that you're releasing and that there's another one called an infinity
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.040]   block and we'll talk more about that later so do you have an uh an idea when that one will be ready
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:28.880]   for uh you know for sale on the website uh yes I I'm guessing within the next two to three weeks
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:34.320]   okay all right and then then we'll cover what the difference is so now uh for anyone who's
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:40.960]   interested uh in the Leleque products there's uh charged clothing a emf clothing there's charged
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.280]   pet products there's charged uh people products and penance and things like that where you can wear
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.760]   this and then the benefit from the different frequencies and the positive energy for yourself
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:58.880]   now this thing by itself you're saying that it has a field of about what 130 150 or 200 feet right
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:05.360]   or something like that yes about yeah 130 145 feet yeah so you bring it into your home and you put it
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:09.680]   in the middle of your home and your whole home just resonates with uh with the energy now is
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:16.160]   are there any frequencies built into the or put into the key block or is it just like neutral energy
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:22.720]   neutral I mean everything is frequency anyway so we couldn't say there's no frequency in it right
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:29.920]   because energy is frequency but I think from the um to explain it to the mind and how we think
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:36.560]   it's neutral energy in there and then it has the capacity to create and recreate
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:43.120]   any frequency that exists so it's like this little energy portal that you know kind of
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:48.560]   resonates a field uh and it just resonates its energy and and you're and the testing the third
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:53.680]   party testing is as demonstrated that it has a positive effect on living organisms as in
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:59.440]   in respects to emf dirty electricity all that stuff so okay so with that established now what
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.920]   happens if I put something in it um that like has let's say um you know just anything like you
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:11.520]   know a lot of folks are are very attuned to uh reiki uh using different stones and crystals and
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:17.680]   and the claims of of those different types of uh items having their own frequencies or let's say
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.400]   um you know just putting in a multivitamin and I want that you know the vitamin or the positive
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:28.640]   benefits of of those you know of that to permeate through the house um what if I just put something
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.960]   inside that would that then like resonate the frequency of that item resonate throughout the
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:42.960]   field um if you put the intention in yes uh if not then not um and that's really so if you just put
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:49.280]   something in uh for it to be charged let's say you want to put you put your phone in for that phone
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   to be charged then that's all it does if um you put in um some organic peppermint oil and you
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:05.200]   want that frequency to radiate throughout your whole home um you know throughout the day or for
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:10.800]   an hour or whatever and then you put that intention in it it sounds crazy but it's exactly how it
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:17.680]   works um and then uh it also radiates you know through that field until you take that bottle of
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:27.440]   the peppermint oil out of the quantum block and now with charging objects um that just happens so
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.760]   and and there are different types of objects obviously that you can put in you can put in
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:42.480]   anything whether it's groceries or water or beverages or nuts or a phone or a Wi-Fi router
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:48.960]   or your shoes for that matter maybe starting with the shoes now so if you want to charge your shoes
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:59.600]   because this is a true quantum energy space with a free and dynamic um quantum energy in it which
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:07.840]   is very important it is not impacted by magnets you can therefore it's completely dynamic you can
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:17.680]   put your shoes in there and if you have charged your shoes for an hour um the energy will be in
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:24.080]   your shoes and you can walk around run with your shoes even for months and the energy will still
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:34.480]   be in there so that is that is very unique and and very cool and now some other things you can put
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:41.440]   in for example you can charge your water or your orange shoes or a kiwi or you know any such things
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.960]   and literally you don't need to leave anything for longer in there than one minute because after
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:55.200]   one minute it'll be already fully charged with some of those objects where you know like the
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.480]   shoes for example we recommend one hour but with any such objects that i just mentioned
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:06.800]   a one minute is perfectly fine and even if you want to charge an aluminum card or something like that
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:16.080]   really one minute is absolutely enough and um and with your phone again one two three minutes for a
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:22.320]   phone is already enough however we've noticed that if you leave it in there for you know 30 minutes
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:29.440]   it actually starts to do something pretty interesting because the energy is is really going into all
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:36.960]   the network connections um and they'll be even more optimization but it really would would still be
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.560]   okay to just leave it in there for three minutes because it's it's so fast it's so immense the
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:50.800]   the energy in there that it's just so quick and um frankly if you want to copy frequencies right
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:57.440]   that's something you can do as well that literally happens within 30 seconds we we do officially talk
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:03.680]   about and recommend one minute uh just to be on the safe side but there's uh it's not needed at all
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:10.000]   to be in there for any longer than one minute and then it's already done okay so so with regards
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.120]   to frequencies so if like i i was pointing out why you were talking earlier um i wanted to just
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.800]   point out that you know we did a video about different frequencies and there's all these different
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:24.960]   frequencies um that are available at the later key website so something as simple as like a sleep
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.720]   and rest card which promotes sleep and rest right so if i wanted to kind of like broadcast that
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:36.640]   in a in as a term throughout the field then you're saying i could just put that card inside this
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:43.680]   quantum block with the put in an intention make an intention uh consciously uh that i want this
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:49.680]   frequency to permeate through the field and then my whole house will have this this they will resonate
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.840]   with the frequency of sleeping and resting and that's that's how that would work right
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:34:00.320]   that's exactly right and um you know also if you want to put the inner piece card in there for
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:08.080]   example um and let let's say you know you had someone is at a home and and you just all had a bad day
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:13.280]   and you've been kind of at the edge you know and you have kids screaming and maybe the kids are
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:19.360]   fighting and all that and you can put that in and then they'll you know they'll just be more even
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:26.480]   more harmony um and and inner piece promoted yeah that's exactly right okay so that's how that would
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:31.360]   work and then and then what you were saying earlier too in terms of transferring your frequency so
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:38.000]   let's say if i put uh the inner piece and boy does my two-year-old need some inner piece right i could
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.480]   make a little pendant for him right or her and i could just put the the card in there with the pen
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:50.560]   with the pendant or whatever the kid likes to wear right t-shirt whatever and then that would take
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:56.480]   the frequency from the uh it would copy it onto the onto the item oh that that's and then it only
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:02.400]   takes a minute yes it only takes a minute okay so you just put it in there boom 60 seconds take it out
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:10.000]   put the put the thing on the kid and and uh and then over time you know they the frequency harmonizes
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   all right so for you guys with kids there you go um okay no that's really kind of interesting so
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.720]   one thing i do want to ask so is you know when you when you make the claim um that let's say you
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:25.120]   know like that's fascinating to hear i put my cell phone in because obviously it's a really good
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:31.600]   idea because of its emf protective type of uh or not protective emf mitigation right from a
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.400]   biological standpoint is the best way to explain it but if i put my cell phone in there and i kind
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.880]   of want to neutralize the negative energy coming out of it that it's going to reach out and go out
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:50.400]   to everything else in the house that it's connected to um well yes pretty much and so there are all
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:56.640]   all the network waves that you know okay basically end up in the phone and you know through whatever
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:02.160]   you're doing whether you're downloading something or you're having a phone call sending a text message
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:08.160]   all these things right it's it's like you can describe them energetically as tiny little wires
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:16.560]   right um and um that's indeed the case that if you leave it in there for longer than two three
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:24.560]   minutes it starts to even go into all those connections um okay you know i just saw the
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:30.880]   curiosity um you know when your healer network uh kind of put this idea together and kind of
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:37.680]   uh you know formulated the idea of creating this device um how could you explain like
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.760]   how do you know that i mean how do you like i know that rome you have uh one of your healer
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:48.640]   networks name is roman hofner and he's super super sensitive from an energy standpoint
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:54.000]   but is could you describe like how do you how do you see what it's doing or you know knowing what
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.160]   it's doing because you know we're not talking cut flowers anymore we're talking about shirts and
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:05.920]   devices and and food and water how are you how are you able to see that the energy is moving around
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:11.680]   and frequencies are picking up and you know like what what what's your like how do you see that
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:16.560]   i'm just so fascinated that there's these people exist i could see it but could you describe that
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.720]   i mean how do you know that it's happening yeah so i mean it's
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:28.240]   see people say it's it's always seeing it's not it's not always seeing for everybody because there
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:33.520]   there's definitely some healers and clear warriors that have
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:43.360]   different ways on how they see right you know yeah but it's just for some it's annoying it's just a
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:51.040]   but we call it seeing but i think that's first because it's not really exactly the same for everybody
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:59.760]   and then there are different granularity levels on how to see things like that and so for Romans
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:06.560]   specifically you know first of all we're working with those healers that that are not just like
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:13.120]   some random healers that just kind of started getting into it and they you know heal a little
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:20.240]   here and heal a little there they're extremely well known and they have all trained
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:31.120]   lots of healers in some cases thousands and way over 10 000 healers so they have very specific
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:43.760]   and and and deep pure abilities so with Roman when he was born he had he saw all the energies
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:52.240]   and frequencies all the time and he would look at a person as a human and he would he had really
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:57.680]   hard time with the physical scene that's what he had to learn right you know that's something we
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:02.640]   don't have to learn typically right when when you're born then yeah you see all the matter and
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:08.480]   everything and for him it was the the other way around he could see all the energies and frequencies
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:15.040]   and and the organs and what the organs would do and he could look at someone and immediately say oh
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:23.200]   you have a heart problem or you know okay or you're you know tommy comes from this and if if you
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.560]   change that then you change it and then you know obviously over time for him it's not it was not
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:37.200]   just that he saw that he also learned very quickly on how he could move energies and frequencies
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:44.800]   isolate them move them around add them somewhere so he could fix things right i mean honestly and
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:56.320]   that's basically what what you know a true healer would do and so to best explain how it is for him
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:01.840]   and i think that's a picture that everybody can resonate with if if i told you okay you know
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.400]   could you please go into your living room now i've never been in your living room but you know i
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:11.600]   imagine you know there's you know a chair in there there's maybe a sofa and then there are a few books
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:16.080]   or something and some pictures and hey could you please grab that white candle
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:23.600]   pick it up and then put it in your kitchen then that would be a pretty easy task for you right
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:33.920]   and for roman he he can see frequencies exactly like you would see all your different books and
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:40.800]   phases and candles and all that in your in any room right i we could tell him hey roman could you
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:48.560]   please tell us all the frequencies that are here and there's a specific vitamin c frequency can you
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:55.600]   please locate that and then you know take that out and put it somewhere else for example or
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:01.360]   whatever you want and that's really how it works for him so i think that maybe and that's the really
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:11.280]   the seeing and yeah so and then obviously people can we all have that ability and so most people
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:16.960]   have completely forgotten right that there is something like energy that we we that's what we're
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:24.320]   made of and that that we have these capabilities we we do it's just that we most people have to
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:32.560]   really learn that again and train that but that you know life on earth isn't really set up anymore
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:38.480]   in a way where where that's you know what you learn when you're young and quite frankly you
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:44.800]   learn the opposite right yeah it's it's it's all set up in a way where you know everything tries to
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:53.120]   distract you everywhere and and and limit your abilities to remember your own power and and
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:59.840]   your your abilities right and and that's why we have to put in our work then to get through that and
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:04.800]   then once we start to remember that and we kind of think oh wow you this is cool because you know
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:11.040]   this is really that's more me you know what i mean it's it's less me to go to mcdonald's and
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:20.240]   eat a big mac right and and and and do all these other things that that are offered um on earth
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:26.160]   right yeah and yeah so i encourage everybody and so the the quantum blog to come back to that
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:33.600]   is a device that can actually truly help with that because it it does raise all vibration and it
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:40.880]   does so in a in a super natural and non-artificial way and also not in the pressuring way at all
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:50.000]   um where you can you know raise your own vibration and people that are on this inner path that's
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.240]   kind of what they want to do right you know we we go meditate we go to yoga we do you know different
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:04.160]   things just because we want to get deeper into ourselves um and raise our vibration um and yeah
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:09.200]   so that can hundred percent help with that okay no thank you for that explanation i think if
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:14.880]   anyone's interested i mean really do some research on on gifted individuals indigo children that kind
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:20.240]   of thing there are some human beings on this planet that are extremely exceptional i believe
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:24.880]   roman's one of them i've had interactions with them before and it's been pretty amazing uh as
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:30.320]   well as your wife crew she's amazing as well so the idea here is that's how you can win so when
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:36.160]   phillip is describing it i just appreciate the explanation so that's how that's how he knows
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:41.280]   that's how this has been determined as like what uh these things can do what these cube blocks can
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:48.000]   do so before we jump in it may i really just add real quick and but we know certainly that there's
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.920]   you know the world is full of people that and there's still some people and that actually is
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:59.280]   that community is growing that people that know that right and people that also are sensitive and
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:05.280]   they understand all this but then there's the the vast majority so people that they need to look
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:11.840]   at science right it's just you know hey you know if uh if a famous healer she said well you know
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:16.960]   that they don't believe in something like that so that's why we made the effort to really
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:21.520]   also look at it from a scientific perspective and there's a lot more coming out of the next
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:26.080]   two three weeks actually in that regard but i wanted to point that out because just knowing
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:31.360]   that it does all that and that we know all that wasn't enough for us we wanted to also make sure that
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:39.680]   we can scientifically um prove as much as possible of that no that's awesome i mean that's kind of
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:45.520]   why i'm so gravitated towards Layla Q is because you've done both you've actually you know using
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:54.720]   accepted academia methods of measuring biological responses to stimuli plus you know on top of the
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:59.600]   fact that you're using these gifted individuals and then combining those two things and saying hey
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:03.360]   this is what we're coming up with it's pretty amazing and i just kind of wanted to really
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:09.440]   level set that as a baseline for the understanding of what a Layla Q products are and then and then
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:14.000]   what's really most important about you know about this interview is that we're talking about the
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:22.160]   quantum block and this is this is a device by itself for like the whole home and then it also
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:26.320]   could be used to create other devices and i think that's what's really important is that there aren't
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:32.000]   that many other devices out there on the market that you can buy and create more like you know
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.640]   like basically create more devices usually you have to just keep going back to the well
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:41.120]   and keep buying and buying and buying different pieces if you want to share with family and friends
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:46.560]   so but before we get into like how do you do that aspect like how what's the user instructions
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.920]   how to create devices so you touched on something that i'd appreciate if you'd expand on a little
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:46:02.480]   bit but this idea of the energy um kind of like being natural and being like uh you know uh like
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:09.200]   i guess it's like attenuates with the human bio field uh in a natural way it's not artificial
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:13.280]   i was wondering if you could kind of expand on that because other products are sort of like
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:18.160]   to me i mean from what i have experienced or sort of like brute force you know it's kind of like
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:24.480]   coffee um you know if i need to pick me up uh you know a five hour energy drink or a cup of coffee
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:30.880]   but it's artificial because once it wears off i'm i'm back to where i started but as i understand
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:37.200]   the cube lock in the and the lay like hue frequencies and energy isn't artificial it's because
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:41.760]   you said it's not tied to the earth right so it's more like i mean you know for those of you're
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:47.360]   familiar with the phrase source energy um but you know it's definitely different it's not the
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.880]   same energy is that correct and then and then could you expand on that?
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:47:04.160]   yes and so the the reason why we don't use any magnets um is because of that so you can find
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:13.360]   that out there that there is quantum energy in it um very one-dimensional though with only one
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:25.040]   quantum consciousness level um and up to nine at most there will in a device where you have magnets
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:31.120]   especially specifically a lot of magnets you just won't have more than nine quantum consciousness
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:38.480]   levels in there which is actually fairly weak um and it's then propped up through the magnetic
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:44.320]   force of the magnets which is the brute force that that you're describing that's what i'm picking
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:51.360]   up is exactly what what you're what you're talking about and that is something that
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:59.040]   you can notice as energetic pressure or like a slight energetic sledgehammer if you will and
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:06.320]   something that can put you out of balance um for a while until you adjust to it um you know meaning
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:12.240]   that if you have that in your home and then you know you prop that up uh you know have a
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:18.080]   more brute force if you will you still have quantum energy but you have it combined with
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:24.560]   um the magnetics it's first of all it's not a stable field anymore second of all it's
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:32.880]   energetically it's actually an imprisoned quantum energy field um set differently it is
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:41.280]   um it is static right it is it is static in a way where if you were to charge your shoes with it
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:48.960]   that energy would be gone after like you know 12 to 24 hours it's it's it's gone
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:57.440]   because it's not dynamic and the and then also interacts constantly with the earth's magnetic
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:08.320]   field which which also changes and has interactions so the by not using that we're able to just
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:19.040]   use pure quantum energy and really increase and maximize that so um that's one of the things for
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:24.240]   example with the with the infinity block then you know that that radius of an infinity block is
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:30.960]   one kilometer uh which is which is huge right and then you'd be like oh my god that's there's
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:39.360]   and it actually has the just the first infinity block uh has already 600 uh quantum consciousness
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:46.080]   levels or perspective levels there are various ways on how to describe that um which is already
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:51.600]   a lot more than than a quantum block which already has a lot and then if you're wondering oh my god
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:58.320]   how could i take that energetically yeah you can beautifully take that frankly just because it's
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:06.320]   so harmonious and it's so pure um if it were to have brute force with it yeah it just it wouldn't
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.120]   even work it wouldn't even work that way okay i hope that helps a little bit again some of
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:15.600]   these things are hard to explain yeah yeah i've been studying this for a long time and i'm still
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:20.240]   wrapping my head around it but as you were talking i was thinking like so you're saying that like
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:26.960]   these levels of consciousness um it's like different colors combining together the form a
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:33.360]   palette of of just you know as opposed to uh linear stacking so that like even like 24
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:39.760]   consciousness wouldn't equal 24 times one but it'd be just a blend of different colors so that
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:45.680]   it's not overwhelming to the to the bio field right is that kind of like a a good metaphor okay so
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:51.840]   it's just more colors so the more colors you have the more well-rounded the more i guess the more
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:56.240]   you know i guess the yeah okay i'm just trying to figure out a metaphor for it but it just seems
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:02.400]   to me that it's it's just it's more colors i see in my mind when you describe it i see colors
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:08.480]   as opposed to every time you add another consciousness it's another like you know like another step up
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:12.720]   and it's just more and more and more and more pressure or more and more energy it's not that way
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:19.760]   but it's more just more harmonious more more you know in tune with with uh you know source okay
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:26.400]   yes and then to two other analogies maybe one analogy is you know if you imagine uh you you pick
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:32.160]   up a rock and and you put that on the floor and then you stand there and then you look at that rock
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:41.280]   and and you're like oh wow this is um and you're looking at that rock now imagine you have uh
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:47.600]   ninety people with you uh they're all standing around the rock right in a circle and they're all
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:52.800]   look at this rock and they're all like oh my god this is such a beautiful rock you know the energy
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:59.840]   that's being created in that moment is completely different if just one person looks at it or if
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:08.480]   if ninety look at it and create that energy that's one thing and then um if you want to um put in an
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:14.160]   affirmation for example and something that has in a device that has ninety consciousness levels
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:24.480]   versus one that has one it's at minimum ninety times more powerful and faster to manifest things
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:30.960]   um yeah so I think with what you said and these two analogies that I just gave
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:39.360]   um people may develop an understanding of of what that means yeah so okay so let's get into um
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:44.640]   if I were to get a quantum block which I by the way I have one everybody and then just wanted to kind
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:49.040]   of show you it's kind of like my proud baby this is what it looks like when the stork delivers
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:57.200]   your quantum block for you it arrives in a box and and it's all packed up very nicely and then
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:02.400]   when you unpack your your quantum block then this is what it looks like and honestly fill up good
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:06.960]   you know kudos to you it looks like a piece of art and it's just beautiful um but so yeah it's
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:12.080]   very easy to put together and and it's not hard at all to assemble and that's what it looks like
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:18.560]   and so uh let's talk about how do you use it and so um and then what else is it does so let's just
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:23.360]   say because in my house like I'd mentioned earlier I have like I kind of tinkered around and I've
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:29.840]   got one of those tacky on disc you know those purple disc plastic things from the tacky I forgot
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:35.040]   his name and then there's the purple plates and I've got like you know I I've got these other devices
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:42.480]   in my home so how does this energy interact with other devices that you have in your home from
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:48.160]   other you know people that have created these types of devices I mean what happens when when
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:52.560]   you get the cue block comes into your house and it itself is you know and I mean I just you know
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:56.560]   because it's very unique and then you got these other things and you know like people who have
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:01.600]   crystals in their homes right a lot of people have crystals um you know so what happens to those
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:05.760]   other objects and how do they interact with the cue block you can you can you talk about that
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:08.240]   yeah so the quantum block
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:17.760]   doesn't have any negative interaction with any other energy devices or anything like crystals
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:26.400]   the opposite is the case if there is something that is disharmonias or where there's something
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:33.440]   with brute force or something like that the quantum block immediately becomes the boss the boss in
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:40.640]   quotation marks right because it's it's not really bosses we think of it typically but it's it's the
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:49.520]   the one that holds the energy in its hand if you will right so it's it's it's providing the main
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:57.680]   guidance and if there's anything with disharmony or with brute force it's actually leveling that out
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:07.520]   and it doesn't so it provides a very very nice field overall it does not impact crystals or the
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:15.840]   energy of the crystals in any negative way whatsoever and frankly if you wanted to if you're like a
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:22.560]   crystal healer or you love crystals just for the beauty of it you know you can optimize
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:30.480]   you know the energy level of your crystals actually with the quantum block for that you would just
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:36.880]   put the crystal in and not more than three minutes we've we've tested that one to three minutes is
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:45.840]   absolutely enough for that and it'll then yeah it what it does it it brings out the
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:54.320]   the core primal power of that individual rock right so it doesn't it doesn't do anything artificial
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:56:05.280]   with it it's just it's um yeah the the potential of a rock right um is fully being reactivated if you
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:11.760]   will okay so I could take anything else from someplace else like you know purple plate or
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:16.320]   something and if I put it inside the cube lock well first of all if I have a purple plate in my
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:21.680]   house and I got a cube lock in my house there's really no interaction other than the cube lock
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:29.040]   being a more you know I guess a stronger device or more neutral device is gonna kind of I take
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:35.040]   precedent I guess over the the energy coming off of a purple plate right is that canal yes okay
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:40.160]   but if I wanted to take the purple plate and enhance it I put it in the cube lock and then I
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:45.520]   get even more out of the purple plate would that be kind of a way to look at it exactly you can
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:52.320]   literally enhance anything you put put in there okay um you know I was reading the um I was reading
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:58.000]   your website here and in your website somewhere in here it says um you know the time frame so one
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.160]   minute if I want to transfer frequency is it three minutes tops if I just want to charge
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:08.080]   something up what if I like what if I forget it and I leave it in there overnight or something
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:15.920]   are there any like cautions or well and not really cautions I'll get into the cautions maybe
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:22.400]   also but if you know let's let's take a kiwi for example if you leave that in it may may not
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:29.280]   if you leave it in there overnight it may just be over ripe as as as an example right I mean there's
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:39.040]   it's just those types of things um you know we have what the quanta blog it's not really an issue
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:46.160]   if you leave things in there for too long the infinity blog is so strong that if you leave
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:54.320]   certain things in there for too long it's it's going to be permanently or temporarily connected
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.880]   to that quantum space of the infinity blog even if you take it out for a day or two
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:05.680]   so there there are a few more precautions I mean that's not really it's it's nothing
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:12.080]   bad right it's just something to be aware of and with a quanta blog you don't have that it's just
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:18.720]   some of these things it's it's it's going to be too much for the kiwi right um at some point and
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:24.640]   but yeah you can still leave stuff in there overnight if if you have a titanium sphere and
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:29.600]   you leave that in there by accident then you know that's okay it won't do anything with it anymore
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:35.200]   you know it's it's just so after a short so rapidly so after three minutes you're you're
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:40.400]   it's kind of like topped off and that's it so and it's not going to get right it's not going to get
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:45.520]   yeah with with certain materials we say you know leave it in there like the shoes for example if
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:51.760]   you want to have the energy in there permanently that it's a different thing with shoes um for
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:58.880]   for one hour okay and um is that applied all clothing materials and and like sheets like you
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:05.920]   know and if you want to put pillows in there and is that so one hour for like organic soft stuff and
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:13.200]   more like three minutes for more dense or metal type of objects plastic it's no for for fabrics
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:18.480]   in general i would say 30 minutes and but already after three minutes it's already uh there's
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:26.480]   there's just one other level added basically between the minute three and minute 30 if you put
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:34.320]   fabrics in there um and that has to do with with permanency um that that's how i would describe
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:40.960]   it but it's not that you you further optimize it okay so shoes one hour fabrics 30 minutes
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:46.640]   metals plastics three minutes food one minute right and food in the area of food would be like if
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:54.880]   you wanted to put pharmaceuticals and supplements as well one minute yes and so with um what's
[00:59:54.880 --> 01:00:01.040]   interesting to note for pharmaceuticals for example i mean you can you can copy the frequency of a
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:09.520]   pharmaceutical for example and then leverage it you know in a frequency way um now you could what
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:16.880]   what happens at the same time is that the pharmaceutical let's say you put an ibuprofen in right um within
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:26.080]   this one minute the negative slash harmful um frequencies of the ibuprofen you know that are
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:30.480]   harmful for the body right that that's important to say because you know we can't really determine
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:35.360]   what's negative what's positive but what's really harmful for the body and destructive in a way
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:42.320]   that is being neutralized and then what's also happening is that um homeopathic levels
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:52.800]   are added to this ibuprofen and in this example um and you could leave in the ibuprofen for way
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:01:00.800]   longer the the drug never mutates right that's very important to note uh that is very different
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:08.480]   if you had a device that uses brute force you know magnets because then indeed you can see
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:17.280]   mutations um that's not what's happening here however we recommend to never leave um any pharmaceutical
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:25.440]   in there for more than um yeah one to two minutes frankly and i wouldn't do more than a minute but
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:31.280]   you can do two minutes also if you want but the longer you leave it in the higher the potency of
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:37.920]   the homeopathic level um gets and you know you can also at some point really call it the quantum
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:45.680]   level you know the way that homeopathy works you cannot say that um a frequency made
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:52.320]   with quantum energy on the quantum level is 10 times or even x times stronger than homeopathy
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:02:00.240]   that's bs frankly because that's not how it works because homeopathy in and of itself can be already
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:07.680]   1000 times stronger and more potent than the same substance on a different homeopathic level
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:14.800]   right so now with the quantum block though you can enhance that to levels that are incredible
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:21.840]   and incredibly potent so that's just something where you know we recommend you know one to two
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:31.120]   minutes at most and then um i think after that it will be really uh um it may just be too strong
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:40.880]   right i mean some people may want to test the outputs um yeah i wouldn't okay um okay how about
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:47.760]   water like if i wanted to structure charge water to drink give my pets water my plants
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:54.560]   um just by itself i put a glass of water in there like is that one minute as well or
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:03:02.880]   yes one two three minutes one two three minutes and then if i wanted to impart a frequency onto
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.520]   the water let's say i want to add like you know like i'm want to water my plants so i put in some
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:15.040]   i put a sample of plant food um and a glass of water right in the cube lock is it one to three
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:20.720]   minutes take them both out and that water now has the frequency of the plant food and i can
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:26.400]   give that to my plants right exactly the frequency will already be in the in the water already after
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:33.440]   30 seconds uh you know and then water absorbs it like super quickly it may even be 10 seconds only
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.720]   in the quantum block but you know just be on the safe side you know 30 to 60 seconds and then you're
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:46.000]   good to go geez philip i just realized something i i've been trying to get my dogs to take vitamins
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.280]   and they hate me for it right i never even i just realized right now i was like oh my god i should
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:56.480]   have been doing this all along yeah i just got to put okay i've got the dog bite i'll just put it
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:02.320]   in the water oh crap because i you know i don't know if i told you uh i already like i made like
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:07.840]   ball chain necklaces for them with the dog you know heal for dog frequency and and i can tell you
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:12.720]   i mean ever since i gave them those those ball chain necklaces with that frequency on it because
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.440]   they're so small that they look weird when you put a collar on them uh so i just gave them these
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:24.000]   little ball chains and with the frequency and uh yeah it's like my older dog now literally i watch
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.760]   him and he plays more often it's like he never used to really play at night because he's old right
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.880]   he's like me uh but now he's like playing with the puppy morn and in the evening so i'm like wow
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.120]   that's pretty amazing but okay all right i just got it you know so if you want to give your pets
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.480]   vitamins put it in their water as a frequency there you go wow okay yeah and what you can do is you
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:51.440]   could take a bowl uh and then charge it in the yeah that's what i'm doing this quantum block with
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.080]   those vitamins and then make sure you know those are vitamins i mean you you know that but i'm
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:01.440]   this for the listeners uh those are vitamins that would be good for the dog right yeah yeah
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:08.880]   humans and dogs need different things and yeah and then maybe what i would do if if you had that
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:18.400]   bowl that would be your vitamin water bowl if you will right um and also maybe maybe have another
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:25.120]   bowl also where there are no vitamins in it not that's there's you know you can just do two different
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:29.840]   things right it's could you okay here's an idea i'm sorry to go off on a side track everybody but
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:35.040]   i i'm just you know i've been trying to help my dog it's easy my older dog has joint problems and so
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:40.400]   it he needs to take a joint supplement which he also hates to take and have to fight with him um
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:49.920]   so is it possible i mean you know from your perspective by put his food into the cube lock right
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:56.720]   with a a piece of his joint supplement right because he refuses to eat it and he just spits
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:02.000]   it out and we have these big fights all the time with each other but if i can i charge the food his
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.920]   food with the frequency of the joint supplement would the food pick it up so that he's getting like
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:11.520]   the frequency of his because i don't want the puppy you know because she's so little but
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:16.320]   young she doesn't need joint supplements so i could give him the frequency of joint supplements
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:21.280]   through his food and then i could give them both the frequency of dog vitamins just through their
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:26.960]   water so i could do that right i mean and if you could absolutely do that i would still monitor
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:32.240]   that with with a joint supplement because there's even with humans it's uh you know there's
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:38.400]   some people that you know if they do that just on the frequency a basis right whether it's
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:46.000]   if from a suticle for example um it it it works to some extent to some in in in in some cases right
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.920]   works completely you don't need anything else and then with vitamins and a frequency
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:55.440]   way for some people that's absolutely sufficient and then for other people they still need
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:00.640]   you know the the physical but what it does then if they also take the physical
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:08.000]   it's it becomes much more bio available that way that's wrongly phrased in a way it's more that
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:16.320]   the cells can absorb it way better and leverage it way better so you get a whole lot more out of it
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:21.760]   so those are the different ways and that's why i would just monitor it so i would not officially
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:28.400]   recommend here you know if you have a you know medicine for your dog and the dog doesn't want to
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:33.280]   take it you know it's an important medicine to just provide it as a frequency that may work
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:38.320]   where it may not work right up in your point so you don't you don't just uh stop giving them the
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:43.520]   the actual physical supplement but you'd see just kind of just see it just a additional
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:48.560]   enhancement or a support right that you're giving it two ways instead of one way yeah so that's where
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:53.600]   roman would come in handy as an example because these are things that would need to be checked
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:59.600]   then on an individual level i guess you had a specific medicine for for for dog or so and then
[01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:04.720]   you know he could check hey is the frequency actually uh doing the same thing is it is this
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:09.920]   enough for the dog or would there need to be anything else okay good to know okay okay so that's
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:17.280]   real interesting so uh definitely you can charge and transfer frequencies of supplements food water
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:21.200]   that's really interesting um just going down the list here i'm just kind of looking this is the
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:26.400]   website folks so uh a lot obviously a lot more detail if you read the webpage now when will
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:31.120]   this be available to the public because i know i'm looking at a preview uh this page here on the
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:38.160]   quantum block it is currently available to the public okay okay great so anyone interested you
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:42.720]   can kind of go through this and read we just talked about home yeah but the let's talk about
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:49.600]   sound you know capturing sound um using a cube block so um you know i'm sure people are familiar
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:54.880]   with the work of sherry edwards and the q wave uh technology out there you know taking
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:02.160]   sound and turning that into a health and wellness audio frequency for your bio field but there's a
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:09.280]   way to capture sound right and put that into an object or even into a glass of water and then
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:13.120]   drinking the water right i mean so you can use the cube block for that and and how would you go
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:20.960]   about doing that yep that's um easily done frankly so all you do is you play the music to glass of water
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:29.280]   and um then you put the glass of water into the quantum block um i mean
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:37.440]   and you can transfer the frequency the sound frequency would then be in the water and then
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:44.560]   you can transfer it from there into let's say a card or you know anything else where you want it in
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:50.160]   and then leverage it that way the only thing that's where i also would say caution is that what
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:10:02.400]   most people don't know is that well any frequencies somewhat is also um you can perceive it as a sound
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:10.320]   in a way the the specific sound frequencies are different in that regard and if you have them
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:20.960]   on charged on a card for example you don't physically hear um but it still um can create an imbalance
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:29.840]   over time because we have our own sound the body has its own sound and so that's also why you know
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:36.480]   if you leverage sound frequencies and you really listen to them you wouldn't do that all day
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:42.080]   right you do that for a short period of time typically and that's how i would
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:47.760]   leverage those cards as well right okay yeah that's a you know really good point let me expand on that
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:52.960]   i mean um for those of you are familiar with the work of sherry edwards she's done the incredible
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:11:00.880]   work um capturing the audio of it's just like it's really hard to explain but she's captured the
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:07.680]   frequency of audio sounds and how they interact with different conscious states you know uh
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:13.680]   depression and so forth and then she creates these soundtracks working with musicians in which when
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:19.200]   you listen to the the music uh you're getting like uh you know uh you're getting the frequencies and
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:25.840]   the the energy or not the energy but the frequencies and the sound uh to you know stimulate your brain
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:32.240]   or uh there's one for like you know helping you uh overcome effects of the flu or something like that
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:36.320]   but then she herself even says the same thing you just said Philip which is hey this is sort of like
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.960]   medicinal you know you don't want to play it 24 hours a day because you know you don't need it
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:45.120]   you know just you take it as you would if it was a supplement or you take it as you would
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:51.040]   if it was medicine and it's not just all day long 24 hours a day so caution so there's a caution
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:56.320]   which is if you're using sound like when a sherry edwards is tracks and you burn it into let's
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.880]   say a pendant because you want that that with you uh but you shouldn't be wearing that pendant all
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:07.120]   the time it should be used as needed as opposed to you know subjecting your body to that audio
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:14.080]   all the time right yes and that's that's how it's different from um an inner piece frequency card
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:19.520]   for example because you could literally wear that all the time and it doesn't create any stress I
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:25.280]   mean the opposite is actually the case um uh at the same time I just want to mention real quick
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.640]   even though that's not the topic today uh the way it's created with the quantum blog is actually
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:37.920]   the frequency card that the frequency is available in a way where you kind of your system kind of
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:46.640]   learns how to leverage it better and how how to recreate it uh it takes different times for
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:51.680]   different people uh and sometimes we we want to go back to that but it's it's something that you
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:58.560]   don't it's not just a substitute or something that you would then always have to use in order to
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:07.360]   create inner pieces rather almost like a little coach uh in your pocket if you will right um yeah
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:13.120]   okay and then so you also said something I think that uh I don't know if we we were talking for a
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:18.800]   while but I just like I want to stress something that it's about the difference between the cue
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:25.600]   block and other uh you know quantum products out there is that this thing attenuates it in trains
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:33.040]   and it can literally lift your own frequency um and then even if you take it away you're still
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:38.800]   resonating with that frequency and it's not like that whole coffee crash kind of effect right
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.600]   so that like as you're saying this thing kind of you you blend with it and you pick up those
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:50.960]   frequencies but in a harmonious right as opposed to like it's artificial would you just in terms of
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:56.400]   how it compares with other products is that a good way to say it absolutely yeah I think you
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:03.760]   yeah there's nothing more to add almost okay so like if I were to use a frequency uh like the
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:09.920]   inner piece and and I'm just then I eventually over time become kind of like you know I just
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:15.280]   kind of absorb it and it becomes part of my overall frequency so that even if I take the device away
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:21.040]   I still benefit from the from the frequency right so that is absolutely right and I think what's
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:27.120]   what may be a good way to for people to understand is you know if you work with
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:34.240]   with a healer or you know with a sham shaman or you know whatever you have a certain topic you
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.600]   have a certain issue or problem in your life or whatever that you want to talk about and you
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:46.080]   want to find a way in how to you know get over it or fix it neutralize it harmonize it you know
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:54.160]   and all of that or you know get get worked through a traumatic experience as one example
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:59.440]   right I'm told you've done it and so you they help you with that and what do they do they do
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:05.200]   energy work with you there are lots of different ways how to do that they provide offer different
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:12.480]   frequencies right no healer can heal anybody it's just everybody can only heal themselves but the
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:20.640]   the healer would provide the energy fields and the frequencies in a way that that healing can
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:29.360]   actually happen right so now what we try to do is actually for certain topics you know create this
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:36.080]   little healer for your pocket if you will right where for certain topics whether it's the inner
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:43.440]   piece or you know something else it's something as if you work with the with the healer now I must
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:50.480]   say that life session with someone like Roman on a certain topic you know goes above and beyond
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:59.440]   what what a card can do but what what what it would be extremely difficult and likely very
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:07.040]   expensive to work on a healer with a healer on a constant basis every day yeah 24 hours a day
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:12.640]   right that's not feasible at all and there there that's where the cards really come in hand
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:20.000]   extremely handy like have a Roman in your pocket okay you know I know where we're coming up on an
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   hour and I want to be sensitive to your time but I do have a couple more questions if you have some
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:30.400]   time because I think this is such this is the the amazing I mean you know everything we've talked
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.720]   about it's pretty amazing if you're if you're new to this subject it's it's pretty woo-woo
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:39.840]   but wait till you find out that it's actually real but then for those of us that are like really
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:45.840]   into energy kind of work and things like that you've you've been able to take this to a whole
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:50.560]   other level and let's if you don't mind I'd like to just could I get you to kind of describe
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:59.280]   how the cube lock works with you know your your own intentions and affirmations
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:04.320]   and and then not just like putting it into the field like we described earlier but also putting
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:10.800]   it into devices and other living things like I could literally put an intention like into my pet
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.120]   right kind of thing and so can you talk about that because the cube lock is very unique in that
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:24.960]   respect as I understand it yes so you can work with an intention or with an affirmation for example
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:34.160]   and then really leverage the super concentrated quantum space in the quantum block in order to
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:41.840]   bring this or take this into manifestation and relatively quick manifestation I want to point
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:49.120]   out though that there's you know everybody has his her own soul plan and then there's also
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:56.480]   you know something I would call the universal law right which you know if you're tuned in
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:01.600]   if people that are that that's one of the biggest differences between psychopaths and
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:10.480]   just a regular human being right where the psychopath doesn't really have the ability anymore to
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:17.920]   really know what's right and wrong you know what I mean so yeah there's no soulless right we have
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:25.040]   yeah and and but yeah yeah but you would have that ability so you to do you know what's kind
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:30.720]   of right and wrong and so and there's certain things that are they're not wrong that are they're
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:37.360]   not right or that are against the the universal law or against the soul plan and those things you
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:43.840]   also can't manifest that with a quantum block because it's just it's not on the agenda if you
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:50.240]   know what I mean yeah but everything that fits into all the possibilities and those are also by
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:57.360]   themselves unlimited into what is possible and can be done in one's life and achieve right if it
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:07.520]   resonates with the universe and with your soul plan then you can manifest things so much quicker
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:18.560]   and faster it's it's absolutely amazing and so here's how it works if just without a quantum
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:26.080]   blog you can already okay you know go into meditation and then from within really if you have that
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:32.000]   connection okay come up with okay so what do you want to do next what is it that you would like to
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:41.920]   do or achieve right and and again it's something that should really resonate with what's right for
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:50.000]   you and if you put just the thought and intention in there that's one thing but you need to
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:57.280]   create a feeling around it because otherwise it's almost like a phone without power right so you
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:03.040]   have to have this feeling so you go into your you're envisioning what you want to achieve you
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:09.280]   create a feeling for that you literally see yourself being that or doing that or having that
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:16.400]   or whatever it may be and that by itself already creates so much because we create our worlds with
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:23.200]   our with our thoughts and we attract what we think and that's also one of the you know kind of
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:29.280]   difficult things for the for the collective right now that there's so much fear being created on
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:36.160]   earth that there is so much fear in the field right and and people that that are fearful they
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:42.800]   create more of that um so that's not really helpful so we all want to be clean and pure
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:49.520]   and and what we think so that's the basic concept now you can absolutely magnify that
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:56.880]   by leveraging the quantum block because it has 90 of those quantum consciousness levels which is
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:04.160]   which is immense and if you for example write down your affirmation or or you know your intent
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:11.440]   on a piece of paper and then you put it in that's where the extra power comes in and
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:17.680]   it comes in then without you adding anything to it so you can then next minute just forget
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:24.640]   about that thought and and and all that and it's still working it's way through into manifestation
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:31.760]   and then you know you could do other things you could you know copy the frequency of your
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:40.320]   affirmation on you know let's say in a capsule and then wear that capsule or a pendant or in an
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:47.920]   aluminum foil and then have that foil in your capsule or with you things like that you know
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:54.400]   you could put it in water even drink the water I mean those possibilities are endless and up for
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:22:00.800]   tinkering and discovering probably but it's yeah it's uh it's pretty cool and and amazing what's
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:07.360]   possible there that's amazing um okay I totally get what you're saying I hope everyone else followed
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:14.160]   along uh you know I was just thinking um you you could so if let's say I want to help my dog heal
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:21.440]   right he has um uh you know like a knee problem it's right old guy has knee problems I could I
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:26.320]   could use the cue block and put in and put in the intention of helping him heal but I also could
[01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:31.120]   put his leg in the cue block and we could kind of do like a like a hands you know hands-on healing
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:39.200]   um affirmation and intention using the cue block to kind of you know enhance the experience right
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:45.440]   if I wanted to do hands-on healing on my dog um yes yeah okay and I just you can absolutely do
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:51.360]   that what I want to add though is that if we talk about beings like you know dogs and cats and all
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:58.800]   that they they certainly they have their their own will as well and and so which
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:07.440]   wants to be respected and it and it will be so let's say that um it's not that you know dogs plan
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:14.720]   to have a healed knee as an example if that were to be the case and it's really not part of the dog's
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:25.920]   plan a higher plan then you just that also won't work but um then if that word if the case you
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:34.320]   could work with the dog and maybe finding maybe there's just some blockage frankly why why there's
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:42.800]   no um how do you say that um willingness to heal if you will because that that that maybe
[01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:47.440]   something you can then solve actually also with the quantum block but yeah absolutely you can you
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:52.400]   can do that and there's no you're not stepping over the dog's boundaries in that sense anyway
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:59.280]   because the dog will ultimately always the dog's energy system will have the right if you will to
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:06.720]   say yes or no to these things um that's amazing um definitely going to try that um yeah you're
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:11.680]   giving me so many new ideas and I just want to kind of caveat to anyone listening that when I talk
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:18.320]   about healing with hands I'm not referencing any type of religious ideology in that regard I'm
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:24.320]   referring to the fact that I'm someone of of you know I'm very much interested in biological
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:28.880]   magnetics and when I'm talking about healing with hands I'm talking about it from a biological
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:34.480]   magnetic standpoint and if anyone's interested in understanding what I mean read the book rainbow
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:41.120]   in your hands by Albert Roy Davis who's one of the proponents of of bio-magnetics and he wrote an
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:47.200]   amazing book about how our bio-fields that our bodies generate our magnetic and biomagnetic
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:54.080]   in nature and how you could use that energy and heal other beings with your own bio-field and it's
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:25:00.480]   called rainbow in your hands by Albert Roy Davis okay so um just want to clarify that I'm not a
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:06.960]   religious person and so I do everything from a research standpoint but okay so let's we so we
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.880]   talked about affirmations I think that's fascinating I don't really play around with that but it's
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:14.880]   really got to be something where you're not going to say oh I want I want the ability to fly you know
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:20.400]   like it's just not possible but you can you can attenuate your own you know destiny right or I'm
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:27.280]   sorry I'm not attenuated but enhance or or increase it in that regard so that's really cool the other
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:33.680]   last question is we you touched on I think somewhere in here I was reading this and somewhere in here
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:39.680]   I guess I got to the bottom but somewhere in here I was reading I think I was reading the draft
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:46.320]   and it talked about entanglement and so I'm not sure you know I actually did an experiment earlier
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:51.520]   I think last year use you know kind of with the idea of entanglement but I just kind of wanted to
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:56.320]   see you know what are your thoughts or what what experiments have you done using the cue block
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:02.880]   from an entanglement standpoint for those of you that aren't familiar with the term entanglement
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:12.880]   it's the ability to connect to different or or more to or more you know consciousness
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:18.960]   beyond you know space and time so it's kind of like two different places on the planet kind of
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:23.600]   attuning to each other and they're both feeling and thinking seeing the same thing at the same time
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:28.800]   and it's very scientific and it's out there look up quantum entanglement it works it's it's been
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:34.560]   measured in the lab so but but you can use the cue block for that so what are your thoughts and
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:41.920]   what have you done in terms of of experimenting with that yeah so 100 percent quantum entanglement
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:49.920]   with the quantum block works and we've done lots and lots of tests and actually also study around
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:27:03.680]   it so as an example you could put up you take a picture of your shoes and then you put that picture
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:11.040]   in and it does not matter where those shoes and are and where the quantum block is right as an
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:18.720]   example well let's let's say you take a picture of your shoes in in Costa Rica and then you leave
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:27.120]   your shoes there and then you you travel back with the quantum block to I don't know how why
[01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:36.320]   and then in how why you put the this picture of the shoes in there in the in the quantum block
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:45.200]   and then the energy will charge the shoes even though they're you know thousands of miles away
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:53.680]   and so the interesting part is also that we found that you can actually also permanently charge
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:28:02.320]   objects through the distance like that which is uh which is a new finding and it's it's pretty
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:10.400]   immense it's absolutely possible and so you could yeah so if you had a friend somewhere that
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:19.200]   you know had some issues you could literally over distance charge something for them
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:25.440]   that they can then wear and it really works like that you know that you know I've you know
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:32.480]   been asked by people you know does there need to be any other information on the picture then
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:38.880]   but there really doesn't need to be any any target coordinates and all that that's all like
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:44.880]   just thinking just some thoughts is totally irrelevant and unnecessary because the picture
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:51.200]   has a clear individual signature if you will energetic signature
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:59.280]   and certainly it would have to be the exact object right so if you wanted to charge your shoes
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:06.560]   then you would really have to take a picture of your shoes and not like a stock picture of those
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:11.920]   shoes that are available on on a website because that would not be specific oh yeah okay and then
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:19.760]   you know we have done other things like you know for example we you know we we charged um um a
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:25.200]   fabric and then through that way and then we actually wanted to not only energetically know that
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:35.360]   and see that we actually uh um had um based on test that and they um you know then then a person would
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:42.080]   be tested and then the person would be tested again after wearing that fabric and yeah 100 percent
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:52.080]   of the energy was in and it was working perfectly could you do frequency as well yeah wow okay um
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:59.600]   so for those of you playing at home um this is quite an amazing announcement um for you know I've
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:04.560]   been like I said studying this for a long time this is pretty wild if you do want to do more research
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:11.600]   into quantum entanglement um and the idea of how you could use that in your day-to-day life um then
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:16.160]   you know definitely look up the science of radionics that's another way of describing
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:20.800]   it quantum entanglement also has been like I did say it's been proven in the lab that there is
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:26.160]   actually such a thing more you know the scientific detail is too much for this video um but yeah
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:32.240]   radionics quantum entanglement uh that's amazing Philip that you could literally so you can literally
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:39.920]   help somebody heal um let's say uh somebody that your friends and family living like uh
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:45.200]   at a distance and you could then you kind of like you know use the cue block to and with intention
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:52.000]   send them like the the frequency of of of healing supplements and and you know and medicines and
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:57.360]   things like that or or just your intention for them to heal like you know get well soon but like on a
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:04.640]   energy level right yes yes that's pretty wild okay you do that okay so um you know we're over
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:08.800]   the one hour mark and I do apologize I try to keep everything down to an hour I know everyone's
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:15.200]   time is so valuable but before we go I do want to talk about purchasing instructions um because I
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:19.840]   know that there's a license agreement and so we're gonna I'd like you to chat about that and then
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:23.520]   at the same time though you know we're looking at this and you look at you look right now you've
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:29.040]   got it on sale so I've got a couple of questions about you know like if anyone's interested in
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:34.720]   obtaining a quantum block um then there's a couple of things and and it's like well it's a lot of
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:39.440]   money to spend that's the first question so how would if you're brand new to this how would you
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:44.000]   you know Philip what would be your recommendation to someone does you know try before you buy like
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.320]   maybe do a pendant first or you know experience I think you touched on that earlier but you know
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:52.160]   what would be your recommendation to someone that's like well that's really a lot of money you know I
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:57.520]   want to try this energy but you know I you know what can I try first before I commit to a larger
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:03.920]   amount question one question two is like this is pretty awesome sale how long is the sale last
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:08.240]   and then my question three is you know what are the what's what like what what is the license
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:12.560]   agreement what do I got to know so maybe you can just take like what you know question one you know
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:18.400]   how does someone introduce themselves to the Layla Q um product and and you know like
[01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:22.560]   before you want to commit to a cube lock what would you recommend to somebody
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:28.960]   yeah I think then in that case unless someone knows instantly and if you're like a newcomer
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:33.680]   you've never heard about this and you instantly know wow you know this is what I need then you know
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:39.760]   go ahead because that's uh you know I think with some people they just know this or they see that
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:46.720]   but if you're not that person then absolutely like you said you know maybe uh try a frequency card or
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:55.520]   the heel capsule for example because you know that's not as much of an investment but you get to
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:02.800]   experiment you know some of that energy already and yeah and then you'll develop a feeling for that
[01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:11.440]   and and I think then you'll be able to make a better decision that's that's probably a good way
[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:19.120]   to go for that okay yep okay and then the other thing was the the sale I mean how long is uh this
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:26.080]   sale price gonna gonna I mean do you have like is it a specific sale for right now um and and then
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:30.720]   how would it compare to like I know that you're not going to launch the infinity block for a couple
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:35.120]   of weeks but you know like if you're one of the people like myself I kind of jump into the deep
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:41.200]   end of the pool because I just want to tinker uh and so uh but like if people are thinking hey you
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:45.520]   know this one's on sale right now but there's another one coming out do I want to wait till the
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:51.200]   other one comes out or you know could you kind of touch on that like like from a like which one
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:56.000]   should someone get if they're gonna should they wait for that other one and how do they know which
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.680]   one to get do they want to have both you know could you comment on that yeah so first of all it's
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:09.120]   not a requirement to have one to also get the other so that's uh or or both obviously right so
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:17.680]   that's that's you know however um you want to decide and um in terms of the price uh we want to say
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:24.560]   that the actual value is way higher than the 1499 way way higher if you also compare it to
[01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:31.280]   other devices on the market but at the same time you know we always look okay what's
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:37.440]   what's the right price from a universe perspective and currently you know it's
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.360]   it's tough for a lot of people in the world financially you know there's COVID going on still
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:50.320]   and and all of that and we don't want to limit this so that's why we set the price as is and why is
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:35:00.800]   there now a great discount that's that's the special um yeah launch slash COVID support
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:07.680]   discount if you will and I can't say at this point how long this will be available but we wanted to
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:15.440]   at least make it available for the first 30 days so that's as much as I can say okay um yeah and
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:22.480]   then about the um about the like the infinity like um you know like I was saying like how
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:27.840]   how would someone decide which one should I get you know I'm just because uh you know when I see
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:31.920]   this but I know that you've got something even stronger because I'm a guy right we want the biggest
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:37.520]   TV we want the strongest you know we're never satisfied like oh there's a bigger one let's get
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:43.440]   you know so I mean is that something that I mean for my like should our should people be thinking
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:48.080]   like hey wait till you see the infinity before you make a decision on the queue or you know like
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:52.320]   how I mean how would you approach that I mean if I want someone to say hey Philip which one should
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:36:03.920]   I get and what's the answer to that yeah so if if one's focus is is uh truly only on um power and
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:15.040]   range and um quantum consciousness levels and manifesting faster and better and all of that
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:22.480]   the infinity blog is is way stronger even um certainly and then you you can actually also
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:29.280]   I mean there's there's really no limit to it and and again in a completely pure way right that I
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:36.240]   want to mention that that's that's very important there's there's zero brute force in there um but
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:47.680]   so with a with a quantum block it's it's a lot easier to do basic charging and to um work with
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:37:00.320]   frequencies to um to create your homeopathic or quantum medicine um objects right to get
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:09.680]   more harmful effects out of out of pharmaceuticals for example I would not recommend to put a
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:16.400]   pharmaceutical into an infinity block and then take it I mean even if you put it in for three
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:19.760]   four seconds it's just uh it's just going to be too strong
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:28.160]   so so you know that's this is here the and and then you know additionally everybody that's you
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:34.480]   know sort of new to this or doesn't have any such device definitely this year I would I would
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:41.280]   recommend the quantum block and it's again it's it's way way stronger way way stronger than anything
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:49.600]   out there uh in terms of pure quantum energy yeah so it's already quite advanced uh but you can
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:54.560]   certainly take it energetically and yeah that's as much as I can say about the infinity block okay
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:59.440]   okay cool uh yeah as you were talking I just I was thinking you know like if I were a farmer
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:07.040]   um or you know like let's say um you know like wanted to do an entire nursing home you know
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:12.640]   then getting an infinity block has got a much bigger field uh and you could you could affect a
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:18.480]   much larger area and anything in that so if I were to like if I wanted to like uh let's say
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:25.200]   uh you know energize my field I would definitely get an infinity so that there's size matters I
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:30.400]   guess uh and then anyone who's interested in that kind of stuff the concept of that is called
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:35.440]   uh there's a you know quantum field broadcasting uh and there's a couple of good websites out there
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:41.200]   that talk about using quantum technologies with uh agriculture uh so here's the uh so the infinity
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:46.240]   block would be perfect for that okay so oh let me wrap up so there's there's a license agreement
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:50.800]   so most people buy products there's usually not a license agreement so could you explain you know
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:56.240]   like well why it is and and what it is so that people understand so from a purchasing let's say
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:00.720]   somebody wants to tinker and they want to get a quantum block it's on sale for at least 30 days
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:05.360]   you got a great price but what's what is the license agreement and and how does the you know
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:10.800]   purchasing instructions how does that work yeah it's just uh for personal use and by the way so it's
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:20.240]   this is the the license agreement here okay process um it's not there right now so if anybody
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:28.320]   currently wants to purchase uh please send an email there to um um info at lilaq.com and then
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:34.640]   we'll um we'll also send you that uh very simple and basic agreement frankly and it's
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:42.080]   basically states it's for for individual use um and not for commercial use however we do offer
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:50.880]   also um you know to use this commercially so you know that's something you can inquire about
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:57.040]   that's absolutely possible as well okay so this is if uh if i buy a cube block and i want to like
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:40:04.800]   make um um items and for friends and family um then it that's considered personal use right but
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:09.760]   if i try to sell the items or let's say i'm a winery and i want to impart quantum energy into
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:15.600]   my my wine and it to enhance the flavor you know and you know stand out from the other competitors
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:19.360]   then it would be a commercial license and they need to talk with you about because they're selling
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:24.640]   it right they're using it to sell stuff exactly exactly if you were jewellery shops for example
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:29.600]   and you wanted to charge your your items then with that and you know they're for sale then you
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:34.800]   know that would also fall under commercialized and well this would be such a really interesting
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:40.240]   project to kind of get you know one of these for a restaurant can imagine if a restaurant were
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:44.400]   to like charge a plate every time they serve it that would be interesting to see what would
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:52.080]   happen with that restaurant yep but that would be a commercial license okay so that's it there so
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:59.760]   the the website's called lailaq.com um and now it the so the um and this is their website and
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:05.040]   blue phillips website and then if you want to if you're interested in any of the products you just
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:10.720]   go down here to learn about products if you want to purchase then it's you click on shop learn more
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:15.360]   about the healer network right here and then again those test results are right here under research
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:21.520]   studies and certificates so um philip uh is there anything else you would like to add before we uh
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:28.560]   and any other like uh you know the thought you want to share well first of all just thank you again
[01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:35.040]   for you know being secure is about it and um asking you such great questions um and then the
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:39.200]   last thing i would add is just you know for everybody listening you know if you're interested in this
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:45.760]   topic you're you're always welcome to reach out to me directly um you know you can go through the
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:51.920]   general email but then you can also do that on telegram and yeah maybe join our quantum power
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:58.320]   group on telegram which is a very fun group and we have lots of great things planned actually for
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:06.800]   2021 a lot of great interviews and information and you know you don't have to engage really it's just
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:11.440]   if you just want to listen in and just learn a little bit about the topic or or ask questions
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:15.520]   frankly you know you're absolutely welcome it's not that there's a bunch of people that
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.800]   just know so much about it and then you know they don't want anybody else and the opposite is the
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:27.280]   case it's a completely like give and take and it's it's just a wonderful community and uh yeah so
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:33.520]   feel free to join if you want and i'm sure that k will have the um but the link uh in the description
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:38.560]   also yeah for those of you not familiar with telegram it's just uh online chat group and it's
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:43.840]   just comprised of a few hundred folks right now and growing uh people that are interested in the
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:48.640]   topic uh of quantum energy as well as the lay the products and have questions and you know if you
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:52.640]   wanted to ask anybody you know like there's no such thing as like amazon reviews for this but
[01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:57.120]   that's where you would go and you can just ask anybody who's like a regular customer non-affiliated
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:01.440]   uh just like hey and does it work for you and then you're gonna get a lot of responses so it's a good
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:05.840]   place to ask questions a good place to kind of meet other people that are interested uh in this
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:11.680]   technology and uh in in an energy work in general so yeah i'll put the link in for the telegram chat
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:16.880]   group uh so okay uh philip hanging on the line and uh i just want to say thank you for your time
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:21.760]   everybody and and for listening to this video philip congratulations on your new product very
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:27.600]   excited looking forward to tinkering with mine so thank you very much and thank you appreciate your
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:30.600]   time. So hang on. All right. Thanks, everybody. Aloha.
