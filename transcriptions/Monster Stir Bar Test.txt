[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   Hey everybody, just want to give you a quick video.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.720]   I bought this 2-inch monster stir bar, that's the one that comes with the stir, the little
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.680]   blue guy that I use, and I bought this monster one, the 2-inch one, and I'm discovering it's
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.440]   got some limitations.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.600]   So watch what happens when you take this giant monster bar and you turn the dial.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.000]   And so it looks like I normally run the dial, like right now I'm stirring some MCT at about
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.560]   11 o'clock, and you can actually turn it to about 2 p.m., you know, the 2 o'clock, and
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.880]   it'll still stir, but because it's MCT, you know, it's just, it's like water.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.360]   But over here I've got MCT and coconut, and watch what happens.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.160]   I mean, look, look, I got it up to 10, and it's got nothing happening.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.280]   And then all of a sudden, it kicks in at 11, and I've done this several times now, and
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.520]   then this monster bar, boom, as soon as you hit 12 o'clock, it just falls, and it just
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.840]   does that.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.860]   And so then the only thing that's really interesting about this giant bar is that it only works
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.360]   at a somewhat like medium speed.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.360]   So, ah, shoot, it's just driving me crazy.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.360]   Trying to get the right speed.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.080]   I don't want to go too high, but I want to get as fast as I can get on this thing.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.760]   But that's about it for that monster bar.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.760]   And then you can see right here, this is about, I'd say this is like 80% caprylic and about
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.080]   20% regular coconut, and so, shoot, do you see that?
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.320]   It just flipped over again.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.880]   So you have to turn it all the way back down, and all the way back up.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.000]   And I'll tell you this, I thought it'd be a lot easier to work with this bar than this.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.040]   You know, I mean, I'm going to have to keep an eye on it, and I'm at the babysit it.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.160]   But the good news is, it does create a little bit of a vortex.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.840]   Not as good as the one inch bar, which is what I thought would happen.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.240]   So, hey, you know, what this means is bigger is not always better.
