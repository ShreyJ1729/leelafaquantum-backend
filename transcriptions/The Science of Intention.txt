[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and in
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:12.480]   this video I just wanted to share my thoughts on something that comes up a lot in the quantum
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.720]   telegram chat groups and in general it's the idea of manifesting intention you know and there's
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.080]   so much about that in media and about you know it can a person affect you know their reality and
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.880]   the outcome of events and that sort of thing and if you go on to YouTube or you go on anywhere on
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.400]   the internet there's just tons of material with all of these different types of you know you know
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.440]   gifted talented people philosophers and thought leaders that are actually putting out a lot of
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.520]   information about how to manifest intent and the way to go about doing it but what I didn't find
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.440]   and I'm kind of a armchair scientist at heart I didn't find like you know like what about the
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.400]   science what does the science say about intention so I thought I'd just put some thoughts together
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.040]   and I thought if you found this interesting you might want to you know listen in on this video and
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.720]   and the idea of this video is to address just that question you know what is the science behind
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.800]   intention what does the literature say and you know is it real are they you know is science is
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.440]   are they finding it in in you know in the experiments that they're doing and are people looking for it
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.800]   and trying to understand it and also to you know what are the proof you know what are the evidence
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.440]   of demonstratable experiments and and that are you know repeatable evidence of intention actually
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.880]   making changes to reality which is mind-blowing if you really think about that and then if they
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.000]   have found if science has discovered that intention is real manifesting intention is real i.e. it's a
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.360]   physical scientific fact that it can be done then what's the best way to go about doing it and I'm
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.160]   going to save that little gem for the end so stick around i'm going to try to keep this as quick as
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.240]   possible and really appreciate it but this just me thinking out loud about the science of intention
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:11.600]   first things first now the most simplest most common science related aspect towards intention
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.720]   you know a person's mental ability or the just that person's ability to affect the outcome of
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.840]   events is the placebo effect and you know and then there's all these scientists out there that you
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.280]   know they don't even believe that you know human beings have this kind of gift or this talent but
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.520]   the truth is every single study that's done has to account for something called the placebo effect
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.880]   and i'm i'm sure you've heard of it if not it's quite simple normally let's say if you want to let
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.640]   here's a good example there that the original rat study for the c60 you know they wanted to see it
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.920]   does c60 kill rats and you know how much c60 kills the rats and that's when they discovered
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.040]   this was a para study in 2012 they discovered you know hey it didn't kill them they end up
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.960]   living twice as long so but the thing was is that they had three groups of rats and they had to have
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.640]   a control group and so the control group was just given water and one was just given olive oil and
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.640]   in one group a third group was given olive oil we see 60 in it right and so the whole idea was that
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.000]   there was a placebo in there i.e the first group was just given water and so they were getting
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.240]   nothing but water and obviously nothing would change you know it's not supposed to now when it
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.040]   comes to animals okay there's no placebo and that's why you know that's why there's such a huge deal
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.000]   about using lab animals for studies right but that's the concept is you give one group
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.280]   water or you know in some cases sugar pills or saline or you know whatever you're going to do
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.840]   and that's what those placebos do so in the science literature there's actually numerous
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.680]   write-ups about it and i plucked one out of the science literature called the placebo effect
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.800]   by courtesy margo and this was published in the in the survey of orthomatoma worth
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:01.680]   orthomallology sorry under therapeutic review and and this was a paper that reviewed the concept of
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.160]   the placebo effect and went into deep study about it in all the different iterations that science
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.200]   finds this effect and how they get around it or how does science deal with this concept
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.600]   when they're using humans and so the paper basically and i'll just pull i just pulled out a snippet
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.200]   from the paper to kind of summarize what the paper concluded which was the role of the placebo
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.840]   in modern medicine is poorly defined because of a lack of a common understanding of what the
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.200]   placebo effect is and because of the negative connotations associated with its use now the
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.320]   response rate to placebo varies by illness the natural course of disease and patient or physician
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:48.560]   bias can be misinterpreted as a placebo response in research the placebo effect is therapeutic noise
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.120]   to be removed by placebo controlled trials few studies are designed to measure the placebo rate
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.600]   response rate directly and placebos are a reminder of how little is known about the mind body
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.640]   interaction the placebo effect may be one of those most versatile and underused therapeutic
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:15.760]   tools at the disposal of physicians wow that's that was the conclusion of the paper and what that
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.720]   really means is that the placebo groups when using humans you know they're taking like their
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.160]   drinking water or gaining saline shots but they're getting a percentage of them are actually getting
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.840]   the same results as those who took the drug you know the experimental drug and so how in the world
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.920]   can someone who's getting water have an actual improvement in their illness disease condition
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.880]   as the person who took the drugs they didn't get any drug but somehow they got better and that's
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:51.360]   the placebo effect somehow the suggestion of the process got into that person's mind where they
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.240]   believed that they we know they didn't know they were getting you know water or saline and that they
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.280]   their mind was able to then cure whatever the problem was that they were studying and that's
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.080]   the problem with science is that all of a sudden now you've got humans pop up and they can do it by
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.960]   themselves without all of these pharmaceuticals and that kind of obviously makes the pharmaceutical
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.040]   people nervous because our minds can cure ourselves which is the end result of what the placebo effect
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.480]   is and so now the science obviously is trying to figure it out they still don't know why people
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.880]   you know can do this you know but they know I mean why they do it but they know that they can
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.600]   because they have to account for it in every one of their studies they have to account for the fact
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.480]   that there'll be a percentage of the placebo control group who got nothing literally
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.120]   little didn't get any drugs but somehow they're going to have a positive reaction or negative
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.240]   reaction to what they believe was getting actually the drug and that's just pretty amazing how the
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.040]   brain just kind of does what it's going to do and science has had to acknowledge it
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.680]   so here's one example it's called the placebo effect now the other example out there in the
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.920]   science literature is in effect called the observer effect now there's a guy pulled out a couple of
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:08.880]   papers once by a k back clonsky and another one is by mesimiliano sasoli de bianci and this was
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:15.600]   published I believe in springer this other paper was the observer effect and it was published in
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.280]   I believe it was since one of the science literature journals and this individual is from
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.000]   Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts now these two individuals did separate papers where
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.680]   they studied every possible iteration of the concept of the observer effect and this was first
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.840]   discovered in experiments with quantum mechanics and what happened was was they discovered
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:44.960]   scientists discovered that the outcome of experiments at the quantum level and now they've
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.000]   realized it's not just the quantum level that it's happening at the observer effect has a pronounced
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.880]   you know impact on the results of studies that they've been doing in other words what that person
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.280]   the person that's observing the the study the results are different based on who's doing it or
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:09.120]   if it's being done at all meaning observation so now in this one paper by debont da bianci
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.360]   the paper concludes and is a very long study by the way links in the video description of all
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.080]   of these papers if you'd like to read them yourself they are quite fascinating and so this paper is
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:26.160]   extremely long goes through every possible way that a observer can interact with an experiment
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.720]   and at the end of the day the paper concludes this work emphasizing that whether in classical
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:40.800]   or relativistic or quantum physics many of our interpretational problems might be the result
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.680]   of an insufficient understanding of the articulated structure of an observational process
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:52.240]   and in particular of the fact that many of our observations are in fact so to say meta observations
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.600]   observations of intrinsic or relational properties that are created or destroyed
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:05.120]   by the observational process itself okay so this is the conclusion of all of these different case
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:11.120]   studies where the observer effect was noticed in the experiment was at the end of the day they
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.880]   concluded that yeah observing it has a huge impact to what's happening and it could literally
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.600]   either you know can completely change the results and and how does that work how does
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.120]   the presence of a human being uh watching what's going on or interacting with the experiment
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:33.600]   affect the results but the hows are not necessarily known just like the placebo effect
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:39.520]   the how is it known but the what is and what is is being documented it's in the science literature
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:45.200]   and it exists and it has to be dealt with and that's what the challenges are for science today is
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.680]   they're saying wow wait a minute we try to do an experiment we've got people out there getting
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.760]   water and they're just there just by telling them they've got the drug you know the drugs you know
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.480]   the quote the the quote quote drug uh the water is actually having an effect and here you've got
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.960]   another group of science issues where you're like hey every time we have an experiment based on
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.960]   who's observing and how they're interacting with the with the experiment and how many people are
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.160]   interacting with experiment it's going to affect the results of the experiment so how do we you know
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:19.040]   as as humanity rely on the on the outcome of studies if the person that's involved in the study
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:24.960]   actually has an effect so now with baklowski he wrote a paper and he did the same thing he went
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.480]   and studied all of these different other uh you know studies that had been done where the observer
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:36.320]   effect was noted and then he wrote uh paper and basically the summation the sum sorry this
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.840]   some summary of this paper is that this article presents a number of examples of the observer
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.200]   effect in purely classical processes it also introduces a framework for understanding and
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:53.680]   analyzing many of the many of such effects for classical system systems ignoring observer effects
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:11:00.080]   can cause errors and experiments at a macroscopic level where no quantum effects would be discernible
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:06.320]   consequently there are practical reasons for being careful to address observer effects
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:15.040]   so when you take into context the impact of an observer the impact of a placebo effect or the
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.800]   observer effect in all of the science that's being done and all of the results that are coming from
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.040]   the science experiments and all walks of life and the decisions that are being made on those
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:30.160]   external results and then you realize wait a minute they all could have been different based on
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:37.280]   who who who did it it calls into question honestly everything that we know and so you know i also
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.160]   want to point out one last thing here about this issue about the observer and this was interesting
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:48.640]   because just September 11th 2023 there was a recent article in psychology today called
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.440]   what does quantum mechanics say about mind powers and it talked a lot about the quantum mind and
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.800]   how we define the structure reality but what's interesting in here was they basically talked
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:05.200]   about a recent study called you know it's basically the the dimensional reduction of quantum gravity
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:11.760]   in the presence of observers and in this study what they what the study did was they basically
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:18.880]   did a study where they shot you know basically light through two slits in a in a board okay and
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:24.960]   and when and this is what was amazing about it when they set up observation cameras to watch it and
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.880]   then people were looking at it through these cameras the pattern on the wall on the other
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:37.120]   side of the slits where the light was shining through okay i had a certain pattern and then when
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.240]   they stopped looking at it when no one would look at it then the pattern was different so the just
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.800]   and that was the only difference in this in the experiment was just by the fact that you're looking
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.640]   at it it changed and that's that was one of the most remarkable recent studies or recent
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:58.800]   evidences of the power of the mind affecting the results of of reality you know actually a
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.720]   consequence of of what's going on in the reality in the world of reality so quite an interesting
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:11.120]   paper that was created just recently and these papers amongst themselves is demonstrating now
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:19.280]   this is what science has discovered and is trying to understand and about the you know the issue of
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:24.960]   intention you know and that's having a person involved in things having a human involved now
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:31.920]   another thing then this is a famous if you're familiar with Masaru emoto he wrote a book called
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.480]   messages from water there's a documentary about this as well i'm gonna play a little bit of it with
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:43.920]   you now what masaru emoto had done i think back in the 70s and 80s was he started he had a theory
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.840]   where he believed the course that you know humans have the power to to you know basically affect
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:55.920]   reality and he believed it all was done by vibration so what he did was set up a series of experiments
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:04.720]   is obviously in japan where he set up a series of experiments where he basically had uh his lab
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   he and his lab assistants speak a word to a vial of water and then they would flash freeze the water
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:18.560]   and see what the crystals the waters as it turned into ice what those ice crystals looked at because
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.840]   water is a liquid crystal and when it freezes it turns into a solid crystal right and then you
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.560]   could look at the formation of this of the crystal itself you know we call them snowflakes but you
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.680]   could see what the difference was based on the words that people were using to kind of not just
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:41.280]   say hey we know that the mind has a power let's say we know that there's a there's the ability to
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:48.640]   project your intention into your reality and change the results of you know science studies
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:54.240]   but now here's one where they actually were able to run these experiments over and over and over
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:02.080]   and actually demonstrate that the power of words could change the structure of water as the water
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:07.760]   picked up the vibration of the intent coming from the individual it's a fascinating study and so
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:14.960]   this was just a snippet from the documentary where this is dr emoto and this is where they
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.320]   understand that you know that that words are vibrational and then they had basically then
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:26.080]   they you know it says right there i won't translate but here you go in terms of how they
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.720]   spoke words to the to the different vials of water and then they flash froze them and here's the
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:38.320]   results that they had in terms of what they saw we exposed water to was arigato this is a japanese
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:44.800]   word for thank you the result was a formation of a beautiful crystal structure
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:53.040]   conversely this is what happened when we exposed the water to negative words such as you fool
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:14.800]   multiple experiments followed as we continued to expose water to positive and negative words
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:23.760]   as a result we observed major differences in crystal formation
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:58.240]   beautiful words manifest as beautiful crystals gentle words manifest as gentle crystals
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:06.800]   by appearing before us in its crystal form water is letting us see the hidden power behind words
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:15.040]   so now that gives you an example of how the vibrational frequency coming from a person
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.640]   through the form of words right as you and it could easily be just as much consciousness
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.800]   or it could be intention you know projecting your your bias or projecting your desire
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:30.320]   onto onto the reality of what you're working with but you can see how they were actually with the
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:37.600]   emoto institute was able to capture this in a scientific way to actually demonstrate in using
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:43.200]   water as a medium that it actually could capture the vibration and what that vibration physically
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.320]   looks like once you flash read it now they repeated this experiment using rice and so i'm just gonna
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.720]   give you a quick walkthrough but basically they took wet wet rice i'll put it in two different
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:59.360]   jars put a you know basically spoke to the jars or wrote down words and taped them onto the jars
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.000]   but like this was essentially i'm just going to guess here this was like love and this was hate
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.080]   and then they let the jars sit off to the side they would just basically tell the jar of rice
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.800]   one jar of rice that you know i love you and you're beautiful and you're wonderful and then they
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.360]   would take the other jar of rice and they would scream i hate you hate you know you're ugly and
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:23.120]   then they would put them like you know just exact same rice exact same jar put them on a window sill
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.240]   let them just sit there until something happens and then what happened was within a couple of weeks
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:34.800]   the jar with the negativity developed mold and turned into guck but the but the jar that had the
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.400]   positive affirmations remained pristine and you know and and just the and these are experiments
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.440]   that people have done and put on youtube and it's you can repeat it and so what that means to us is
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:56.960]   there's a huge huge impact of of what we think and what we say uh to the reality around us now the
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.320]   so here we go we basically i'm gonna i've tried to just share with you my thoughts that hey is it
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:09.200]   documented in the and recognized in the science literature the ability for a human being to extend
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:15.520]   out their consciousness through intent yes placebo effect observer effect definitely science has
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:23.440]   said science says it exists the experiments done by masaru emoto demonstrates what is it you know
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:30.000]   how does it work it works through that vibration and not only is it theoretical in terms of like
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.720]   you know the observer effect and placebo effect but in water itself it's demonstratable in a
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:40.480]   physical medium and you could capture the actual differences of intent with you know using flash
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.600]   reasoning water and now of course you can do that with you know in this you know the rice experiment
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.920]   but then here's another thing that was done and this was done at the Princeton engineering
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:56.080]   anomalies research lab and if you remember watching that movie ghost busters you know years ago
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:01.280]   there's that scene where Bill Murray's got the you know the girl and the nerdy guy and he's zapping
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.800]   the guy but you know that's the kind of environment this is uh this was the you know at Princeton
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:12.160]   University there's an engineering anomalies research lab and this lady here her name is
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:21.200]   Brenda Dunn and she was a lab the lab manager at that lab for over 25 years and so she was
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:27.280]   interviewed about five years ago on the new think podcast and so in that podcast you know she
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:32.960]   basically is talking about some of the results that they had in all of their different you know
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.440]   paranormal experiments that they had done where they were trying to get people to you know they
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:43.840]   were testing people for you know psychic abilities and you know abilities to you know you know express
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:50.160]   their you know manifest you know a reality and so forth and what they discovered was the literally
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:57.840]   they discovered through like 25 years of studying this anomaly in humans at Princeton they discovered
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:04.240]   and she mentions this in the podcast and I want to share that with you that you know how to achieve
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:10.160]   optimal results and the most amazing aspect of achieving for those of you who now are going
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:15.840]   whoa okay so it's real science recognizes it uh you definitely can you know you do it with spoken
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:22.400]   words or written words but then what's the what's the most optimal like what is the most optimal way
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:29.440]   that you can actually express or convey intention uh to alter your reality and so this was discovered
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:35.280]   by Princeton and I like to play you a little snippet of that podcast actually it's a a little tiktok
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:42.400]   video a man another individual made of that snippet of that podcast and so I wanted to share
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.920]   it with you I'd share this guy's little video with you under fair use because it's a little bit
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:51.040]   faster than me making it because I would actually be saying the exact same thing so here you go this
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.480]   is Barbara Dunn here's a metaphysical reality that's gonna chop some asses it turns out that men
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:02.480]   and women need to be together to make manifestation work this is Brenda Dunn for a quarter of a century
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:08.640]   she was the laboratory manager at Princeton's engineering anomalies research lab pair which she
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.720]   ran under dr. Robert John the dean of Princeton's engineering school this lab studied how human
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:21.840]   intention psychokinesis and manifestation can and does affect instrumentation electronic and mechanical
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:27.440]   they produce 20 years worth of data improve time and time again that these effects are very real
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:33.200]   but there are anomalies in how these effects manifest especially between men and women but let's
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:40.080]   hear from Brenda Dunn herself so we thought this was fascinating so we carried out another body of
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:48.240]   experiments where we said let's look at operator what we called co-operators two people attempting to
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:56.080]   have an effect together simultaneously on any of the machines it turns out that when
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:02.720]   the two people were the same sex their results were pretty close to chance when they were of
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:08.960]   opposite sex a male and a female operator working together they were getting effects that were about
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:17.040]   twice as large as what they got as individuals but that doesn't end there if it turned out that
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:23.360]   the couple the male female couple was what we called a bonded pair they were in love with each
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:29.760]   other okay they were getting results that were almost seven times larger than what they produced
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:36.960]   individually so why does this happen but it was interesting because the males got these results
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:43.520]   in the direction they wanted but their effects were very small the females got much bigger effects
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:49.920]   but they weren't correlated with their intention their highs would be huge so would be their lows
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:57.760]   and so would be their baselines so they were getting us this very large excursion variability
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:04.080]   but it was not correlated with their direction of intention so let me lowball it for you they found
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:10.160]   that men and women both manifest but they do it differently basically their opposite women at
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.200]   energy to the intent but their focus is all over the place and they might manifest the right thing
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:20.240]   one day and the wrong thing the next and the effects cancel themselves out meanwhile men and
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:26.000]   targeting and focused to the intent so the men can get what they want but might not get a lot of it
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.680]   and i'm sure right now your mind is going to overdrive thinking of all the ways you've seen
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:37.040]   this in people's personal lives all over the place and that's true i think it's a Brenda Dunn yep
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:43.280]   and so that's Brenda Dunn at Princeton and explaining that the optimal results that
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:50.240]   they had discovered with manifesting intent was to do it as a bonded pair and i think that is the
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:55.760]   absolute most fascinating thing because so many of us are you know trying to manifest intent but
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:01.520]   are you getting your partner involved you know if you are doing it as a bonded pair you will again
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:07.600]   as Princeton had discovered will have much much much much better results and it also raises a
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.000]   whole other question that i'm not going to dig too deep into but it makes you realize that from a
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.040]   consciousness standpoint that we're incomplete without each other and i mean male and female
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:23.920]   relationships and that it's sort of an amazing anomaly to have discovered that our consciousness
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:29.360]   works at optimal levels when we are bonded together and i think that opens up an entirely new can of
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:35.680]   worms but if you are trying to manifest intent go get your spouse go get your significant other
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:43.120]   and and give it a try together and you will find some amazing results as demonstrated by Princeton
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.440]   so at the end of the day at the summer here and i just wanted to share these are this is just me
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:52.320]   thinking out loud throwing it together in a little video but the bottom line is that we are quantum
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:59.200]   beings and whether through consciousness or our thoughts our spoken words or even our written words
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:07.760]   we actually really influence reality now regardless of what academic deniers are refusing to accept
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:14.800]   the science of intention has proven this phenomenon and what's really hilarious is it just recently
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:22.240]   September 19 2023 theory of consciousness branded pseudoscience by neuroscientists over a hundred
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:28.560]   neuroscientists signed an open letter calling it untestable pseudoscience oh really oh really
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:33.680]   untestable they're finding it in studies for medicine they're finding it in studies in quantum
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:39.440]   mechanics they're finding it in studies by the emoto institute using water and other types of
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:44.800]   stuff rice and they're finding it at Princeton and you're telling me that there's a bunch of
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:51.040]   neuroscientists out there that are saying it doesn't exist okay so that's that's when people say trust
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.360]   the science well you know that's what that means you got a group of people that prove it and the
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:00.240]   group of people that refuse to accept it at the end of the day and that is the same across the
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:06.320]   board but at the end of the day what does this mean well i guess my thoughts on that to share
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:16.880]   with you uh some parting words is you are an amazing quantum being with the power to affect your
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:23.120]   reality and it's a matter of like how do you do it well you know you can say it you can think it
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:28.960]   you can intend it you could write it down you can use quantum devices like the Layla Q stuff
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:37.600]   to amplify it but you have that gift already all of us do okay and but the thing about that gift
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:42.640]   is you need to control it because for those of you who are trying to do it you know obviously like
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:49.040]   you know it results from Princeton well if you really want better results you know you know you
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:55.440]   need to kind of do it as a bonded pair and then at the same time when i think about all of the
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:01.120]   individuals who are seeking to raise their vibration i think that's a lot of the reason that people
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:07.280]   get into quantum energy they get into quantum healing for maladies and illnesses and you know
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:12.960]   problems but i think at the end of the day everybody you know there's a lot of people in in that space
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:18.480]   that are seeking to raise their vibration and i'll tell you what the in order to do that what this
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:24.480]   proves in order to raise your vibration you need to control your thoughts you need to control your
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:31.280]   emotions you need to control your intent your own bias will affect the results of what you want
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.600]   to have happen and that you know and that and something to think about too is like when you're
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:42.800]   dowsing or muscle testing for an answer guess what you're influencing the answer so you need to kind
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:48.880]   of find a neutral place and one of the things that the the most talented individuals i know
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.880]   that are gifted in this regard they always say it before you try this is one my last thing here
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:01.360]   before you try to manifest intent they always tell it you know tell us center yourself you need to
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:07.840]   find a place of neutral unbiased peace and from that space is where you then would send out your
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:13.520]   intention because if you intend to do so you know if you send out an intention with a bias that it
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:19.840]   happens it it's going to go all over the place you see what i'm saying so you affect everything
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:26.000]   just by your mere desire you know without even saying a word if you desire something to happen
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.960]   and you make an intention for it you can screw it all up so send to yourself find a place of unbiased
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:39.680]   calm peace and then you know try to do some manifestation and use that gift use that power
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:44.480]   that science has now recognized and science is able to prove and then of course that whole
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:49.680]   bonded pair thing is just amazing to me so that's my thoughts on the science of intention i think
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:55.600]   at the end of the day um the science has proven that it's real you can manifest it and even more
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:02.480]   profound is that we are way more than we've ever been told that we are and that we have powers
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:07.920]   and abilities and gifts that are just beyond understanding at this point in science so
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:12.640]   anyway hey man thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed this kind of content if you did like and
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.640]   subscribe i appreciate that now if you want to learn more about me i do all sorts of weird stuff
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.160]   like this i'm just a tinker and you can find me at the tinker's academy just type in tinker's dot
