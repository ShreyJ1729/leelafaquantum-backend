[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   Aloha, everyone, and welcome to another Tingers Academy video.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.680]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer.
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.880]   And this video is another installment in the video series.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.280]   Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech and/or quantum upgrade.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.560]   The question today in this video to answer is, does quantum energy stimulate
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.520]   mold had a chance to talk with Philip von Holzendorf, the owner operator of Layla Q.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.640]   And here's his answer kind of related to EMF.
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.480]   I mean, you know, some of the research that shows EMF actually stimulates mold.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.640]   You know, so I wanted to ask you about mold fungi and pathogens.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.720]   The question is, if I have a block in my house or quantum upgrade location, am I
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.920]   stimulating the, you know, the mold in the house?
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.120]   No, not at all.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.080]   You actually contain it and we've, we've monitored this multiple times.
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.920]   And we, we even had, I think, someone from the community with a significant
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.240]   mold issues after some flooding.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.920]   And we also specifically monitored her home.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.560]   And no, not at all.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.240]   It actually helps with that.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.720]   Okay.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.360]   So your actual studies are showing that outside is just as effective, you know,
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.920]   being treated to quantum energy outside is just as effective as mitigating
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.480]   and or restraining mold proliferation as insight, right?
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.040]   Inside your body.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.320]   In regards to mold, that is what we can say.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.640]   Yes.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.960]   Okay.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.120]   Oh, that's perfect.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.400]   Okay.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.200]   That's, that's the base.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.640]   So that's the answer to that.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.680]   So that's it.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.520]   Quick and easy.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.960]   So thank you very much for watching the video.
