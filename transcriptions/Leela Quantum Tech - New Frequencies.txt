[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   Hello everyone and welcome to another interview with Philip Von Holton Dorp of Leila Quantum Tech.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.680]   This is part two of our original interview we did a week ago and you know for those of you the
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.760]   link will be in the description below for that part one. This is part two. We're going to pick
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.560]   up where we left off and for those of you that are brand new and this is the first video you've
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.760]   seen on Leila Quantum Tech. I do want to introduce Philip. He is the owner and proprietor of Leila
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.440]   Labs which is a C60 company producing C60 oil and C60 topical products and then he's also now
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.040]   ventured off into this other adventure called Leila Quantum Tech and so he's the owner proprietor
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.200]   of that and so we've had an interview before talking about the general basis of the foundation
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.480]   of the energy and the products and now we're going to be today we're going to pick up where we left
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.840]   off which is talking about the different frequencies the new frequencies that are being brought to
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.360]   market in this quantum tech space. Welcome Philip. Good morning. It's really early here in Hawaii.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.720]   How are you doing today? Hey good to talk to you. Thanks for having me.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.080]   Okay so let's talk about you brought a whole lot of new frequencies which is what everyone's
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.560]   kind of like okay what does this one do? What does that one do? So let's talk about that and I
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.200]   want to show people how to get to the frequencies on Philip's new website so it's leilaq.com. That's
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.840]   the website and so if you go into the shop and you go it's page two as we just discovered
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.600]   so if you go down to page two here's your here's the frequency cards and so and then you would then
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.360]   if you want to know what each one of them does you just click on it but before I do that I guess
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.400]   the first question is Philip could you explain what somebody would do with one of these cards just
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.360]   regardless of frequency like how do you use a card? I think would be the good starting point.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.200]   Yeah absolutely you haven't marked you don't have you know just a card.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:08.560]   Yeah so the card is very useful in multiple regards. First of all it's
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:19.600]   it's a soft way of leveraging a frequency that's stored on these individual cards so if it
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.240]   would be first of all good for someone that doesn't really want too much quantum energy but
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:32.160]   really wants to leverage the frequency and they can wear it in their pocket easily so left pocket
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.320]   right pocket wherever it doesn't really matter and it can be leveraged at night in a very smart
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:47.040]   way underneath the pillow. So if there's a topic someone wants to work on then for example that
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.800]   could be done overnight while while you're sleeping and you're integrating and you're
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.240]   basically working with that frequency and working on something we have several frequencies you know
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.040]   one set of frequencies is really geared towards people that you know that are focused on inner
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.560]   development and they you know want to move further they want to develop and there are certain things
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.960]   you know as we peel the onion of ourselves right that we bump into and then we provide some
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:28.560]   frequencies that help on that path. Another set of frequencies we created specifically for certain
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.000]   use cases so that would be something like the sleep and rest card obviously has a very specific
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.240]   use case where you could leverage that and then again you can do that during the day but just
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:48.160]   wearing that card or at night and then on top of that you have this pure frequency stored there
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:55.200]   you'll always have it because it doesn't you know go away and you could also copy that frequency
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.960]   and leverage it in other ways. I don't think we can get into that right now and how that is
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.360]   done but there's a video also on our YouTube channel that explains how you could do it even
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.600]   with the Leela Quantum Heal capsule but there are also other ways on how to do it that's just for
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.360]   maybe for advanced people that already know a little bit about all this stuff. Okay so the idea
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:24.560]   here is that these metal cards contain a frequency and a quantum energy and then you just carry
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.680]   it on you so like in your shirt pocket or near you and your back pocket and it'll kind of like
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.520]   give your whole body that frequency so it's like a whole body thing. Exactly. Okay and then
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.800]   for people put it under your pillow. Okay so then I was reading in the chat and there's a certain way
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.440]   to carry it so I believe it's where the logo and the word Leela is you want that facing the body
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.560]   when you carry these around. Yeah I personally don't care about that so for me it really doesn't
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:03.680]   matter but some people want if they want a little bit more energy then yes use where you see the
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.240]   words written have that facing the body absolutely you can absolutely do that. Okay all right so
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.600]   so yeah I just wanted yeah thanks for reminding me about your new YouTube channel. There's a brand
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.280]   new YouTube channel Leela Quantum Tech channel I'll put the link in the description below and so
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.360]   you're basically you know he's been a Phillips when coming out with these little short videos to
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.560]   explain some of these products so if you've got any questions check the channel go in the
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.720]   telegram ask a question if you don't see the answer but that's where you get more information
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.640]   but I thought we could kind of walk through these you know briefly that's going to take a while
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:46.480]   but just if you could kind of just chat about like okay so we've got I guess there's four different
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.680]   cards called heel one is just the card I guess that's humans right because the other ones are
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.760]   for animals and plants so exactly heel frequency can you kind of describe like what is the heel
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:05.520]   frequency and and what does it do for people? Yes and also just for people watching this right now
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.520]   if you watch this in a while from today you'll probably find an explanation and further description
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:18.560]   of the individual frequencies for all of these frequencies. If you look right now then you find
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:26.000]   it on maybe half of those and we pick the ones that are not intuitive so heel for cats heel for
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.240]   dogs we figured okay we we will provide those definitions later than the other ones it's just a
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:39.680]   lot of work and it will be available soon but yeah so the heel card is indeed for for humans
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:47.840]   and it contains the primal human healing frequency and it has an extension so that is actually
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.640]   also contains certain heel frequencies that were made available or
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:02.080]   trays differently are now available here on earth that just occurred over the last
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:10.960]   three to six month and as people may know there's a constant flow of cosmic energies
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.800]   towards us and then there's also earth energies people talk a lot about cosmic but there's really
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.280]   the earth releases frequencies all the time and it comes up with new frequencies and it really is
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:31.680]   the case that there are new frequencies that are coming at us and most of those we can really
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:41.360]   leverage and so among those there were several healing frequencies that we picked up and they're
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:53.200]   also included here so then in addition to that we loaded the so-called biobase frequency set on
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.960]   it as well it's a it's actually on the bottom here you can see the nutritional biobase card
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:07.520]   it's a set of almost a hundred different vitamins minerals and organic plant extracts and the
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:16.960]   full list of everything that's included you can find here why did we load that onto the heel it's
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:24.080]   because it works very very well in concert and by the way this set here that you're seeing here
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:30.240]   right now that was developed over a 30 year period by a bunch of researchers
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:38.320]   that really checked over 30 years okay what's the optimal mix of vitamins minerals and plant
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.120]   extracts for the human body and yeah I'm sure there are lots of different opinions and lots of
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:51.360]   great scientists we went with the ones that we found to be the best from what we had experienced
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:58.160]   in our lives so far and then we tested this and we tested several other ones and this came out
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:06.800]   to be the best in in those tests and there's a third frequency included in the heel card or in
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:13.760]   the heel frequency that's the primal healing water frequency which is basically the source
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:22.320]   of the original healing water springs that you had on earth some of those do not exist anymore
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:28.560]   others have actually moved and then again others are pretty occupied because they've been
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:35.840]   misused so I mentioned lord and france for example that is without a doubt one of those
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:46.320]   old heel springs heel water springs but it's it's not what it used to be anymore and I mean
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:52.240]   we don't have to really go into all the details but there's a catholic church and others that have
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:57.680]   worked with that source quite a bit and if you go there now and check out that water it's not
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:03.840]   what it used to be so we went straight to the stores to actually have really the best water
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:10.640]   matrix that you can find okay so yeah I didn't realize what you okay so you know I actually
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.280]   watched your video but I didn't realize what you just said was the heel card just the plain old
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:22.160]   heel card this guy right here is the primal healing healing water card plus the nutritional
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.600]   biobase card plus the heel frequency all in one place all in one correct kind like a super super
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.680]   card oh wow okay that's cool yes and because and so the the heel frequency that's in there and
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:42.240]   the way this heel frequency set is composed now it can be leveraged also for other living
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:49.680]   beings like dogs cats whether horses or what have you but in concert now and it would also work with
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:57.600]   that water frequency of course very well but if you add the biobase frequency to it then you could
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:05.600]   still you know have your you know animals participate from it but it's the biobase makes it specifically
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:12.800]   geared towards humans and humans are different and they are in need of different vitamin and mineral
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:18.960]   needs their body is completely different so we figured we need to create something that is
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:27.040]   specifically for dogs and also for cats as well as for plants right so you know long story short
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:34.000]   there's a specific heel frequency and the heel frequency set for dogs and for cats and actually
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.880]   for the plants there's another specific birth frequency that helps the plants and and by the way
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:47.920]   i'll send you a picture later of this one plant that you know what i'm talking about oh yeah and
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:56.800]   that had issues again then we put this heel card for plants right on the roots and it's done amazing
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:04.880]   so you know so the heel for humans has that primal human healing frequency right and then
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:11.520]   you've swapped that out so that and then also the nutritional stuff so that it's now you've got a
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:19.680]   primal canine frequency plus earth frequency plus nutritional stuff for dogs is that what the
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:29.040]   dogs and card is yeah for dogs it's exactly it's the heel frequency for dogs and it it basically
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:38.640]   looks at the the organism and the body and the physiological system of of a dog and what what it
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.880]   needs to come into its optimal state and to be reminded to awfully heal itself right and that's
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.440]   pretty much the same thing for cats but then it can cats are a little bit different from dogs
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.240]   and then plants are something again completely different right so that's why there are
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:02.160]   individual frequencies for that okay so a quick question how does someone who just gets a card
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.280]   for their dog use it with their dog would they like put it under the water bowl so the water
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:13.360]   they're drinking all the time is is charged with this frequency or would they you know other than
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.400]   you know that you can go and buy the the collar right there's a lila quantum collar that has that
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:25.680]   frequency and if for dogs yeah yeah they're great or just dogs we do not yet but we've had a couple
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:31.120]   people ask already so I think that's one of the things we'll add for sure and we wanted to expand
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:37.360]   in this space anyway because you know this is just a start to have collars but there there are
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:44.000]   other things and I guess you had some ideas as well but for now yeah so and therefore it's a great
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.400]   question so the card obviously you couldn't just put it around the the dog's color to hang down at
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.040]   you know that wouldn't really work so what you do is you can either put it underneath the bowl
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:01.520]   indeed and then you constantly have the frequency transmission there another way is really for the
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:07.760]   night if you know where your dog or your cat where they sleep that will be a great way to place this
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:13.840]   card and it will not at all affect their sleep in a negative way just in a positive way because
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:19.920]   again the energy is fairly soft and they'll have this frequency and then they can start
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.400]   leveraging it oh okay all right yeah it's kind of wondering how the
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:31.120]   a card would work with an animal but that makes sense okay okay all right that's great so then the
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:40.560]   plant one is one that's geared just for plants okay so let's let's talk about the next ones here
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.440]   well the men's and woman's boosters is something well I can talk about that one
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.920]   I made a couple of videos about this if you want to watch the videos you can better understand
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:58.560]   what these are but they're geared for middle-aged individuals that really will focus on the things
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:05.440]   that are are the prevalent issues of our age which is you know basically we need to help with our
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.880]   brains you know memory retention and cognitive reasoning and all that so there's a brain booster
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.680]   in there there's a immune booster to help boost up your immune system there's a thing for stress
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:21.520]   relief that helps you manage your stress and then there's one for anti-aging and so what I did was
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:27.280]   I and then there's a fifth one and then the men's one it's testosterone boosters and the woman's
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:33.040]   one it's a combination of different things for women that they're worried about and that they are
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:39.600]   concerned about it as they age which is everything from bone health nails you know their nails their
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.880]   skin their hair their eyes you know their veins you know all these things that women are worried
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:51.520]   about especially hormone regulation so the woman's booster has as this one booster in it that I
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:56.880]   call wahini for women it's Hawaiian word for women and then the men's one is testosterone but
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:03.120]   that's what those that's what that frequency set is so for the men's it's really and you know it's
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.840]   I think it's you know pretty powerful because it really helps older folks and it kind of boosts
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.240]   you and it's different than the nutritional biobase which I which fill up as you would if you would
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:18.800]   agree the nutritional biobase is a frequency set for your just wellness your just day-to-day
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.160]   health right this is what your body needs to just you know be healthy and well and and you know and
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.400]   but these other ones here actually have supplements that you don't normally would buy
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:34.080]   anti-aging supplements and testosterone boosting supplements and you know stress relieving
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.880]   supplements so there's all these extra supplements in there so that's what these two are designed to
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:47.440]   do so yeah and then we'll jump into this one here the emf protection and harmonization can you talk
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.240]   about that one like like okay I guess you have a description on this guy no there's no description
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.640]   yeah by the way yeah like Philip said there'll be descriptions on these they just haven't the
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:02.880]   website designer hasn't gotten to it yet but so how's this one work and and and we're we're gonna
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:08.880]   talk about the the test results but could you describe it yeah and the reason why we didn't
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.080]   prioritize the description of this one is because it's relatively self-explanatory at least what it
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:22.880]   does right it protects in regards to emf and it harmonizes emf so quantum energy in general
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:28.560]   already helps quite a bit with that and you know I have a pretty unique perspective on emf because
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:36.080]   I know that we don't have to be bothered by emf frankly now it's people may wonder so why do you
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:45.600]   sell and offer a lot of emf protection products well the reason is that for that to work that we
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:53.200]   don't need to be bothered at all by any of them and which includes 5g and anything else is we will
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:59.920]   really have to unlock a lot of our consciousness and to be aware and how we can deal with that and
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:07.440]   then we can just with our own um capability we can basically neutralize and harmonize it all
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.520]   ourselves right that that is the ultimate state and that's also where we want everybody to be
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:19.680]   because all of these cards and frequencies are designed specifically to not be a constant substitute
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:26.080]   for something or use it as a drug or something it they're all designed in a way where the body
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:33.280]   and the human system or a dog for that matter if you have to apply the heal for dogs card
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:40.720]   they learn over time how to do it themselves so it's kind of a you also learn it right that's
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:48.000]   for us it's this is the thing right we we want people to be completely independent and self-dependent
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.960]   and and we know and we tell people that they can do all these things themselves it's just
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:19:00.080]   obviously you know 99.9% of the people are still struggling to do that or a lot of people are
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:04.720]   still at a point where they don't even understand that's something like frequencies exist even though
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.120]   they are frequency themselves right so there are lots of different states of where people are
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:14.640]   but then there are people that totally get that but they don't they can't activate the inner
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:21.760]   healer on their own for example and so then if you work with these frequencies you re-learn that and
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:27.440]   then you can also then you can kind of teach yourself with it also right then wear it for a week then
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:33.440]   take it off for a couple days then see if you already kind of get into this feeling again yourself
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.800]   and maybe you need two three month for it maybe you need a year maybe you need a few weeks it really
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.440]   is completely individual but all these cards are designed for that and for the emf protection
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.400]   harmonization card it's really for people that are very concerned about it or that are extremely
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:56.960]   sensitive right so it's a one thing with emf protection frequencies is actually really that
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:04.080]   typically they can protect but they don't do the body any good at the same time which is then kind
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:09.200]   of a waste right because you don't want to stress your body at the same time where you're protecting
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:16.320]   it and that was actually quite an effort we worked with two healers together on this one and
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:24.480]   then found a way where it basically it helps the body to create this field where
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:33.360]   you know picture this outside of your body all these emf frequencies are neutralized
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:41.920]   and harmonized right so nothing enters your system that that is harmful or bothering in any way but
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:48.080]   at the same time it's totally soothing to the to the human body and feels natural and it's not that
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:55.920]   that there's an impact from the frequency itself and that is what we've done so yeah that's
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:01.600]   yeah I think it's pretty self-explanatory okay so and this is all frequency based so I just
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:07.440]   want to point out for you know because there's a whole emf protection industry that's around
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.920]   brute force shielding right like you know like paints and and and Faraday cages and
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.800]   things like that I've actually done a video a couple of videos on how to protect your home how
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.840]   to you know so you know protect yourself from your cell phone but that's brute force shielding
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:31.040]   this is emf frequency mitigation right so there's it's there's definitely a separation there
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:37.680]   and this one is all about how your body responds to emf and then protecting it that way as opposed
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:43.520]   to literally shielding the RF signals coming into your house so just want to clarify right yeah
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.840]   okay because yeah that people get confused because people are thinking oh yeah I'll buy a sticker
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:54.480]   from my phone and that'll protect me and be like no not really if it's if it's if it's not an actual
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:59.840]   RF shield no or if it's not at like a frequency product that's like been proven like like this one
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:07.120]   has the answer probably not you know so yeah okay so we talked about the healing water card what is
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:14.000]   what is prosperity okay so this one's got a this one has a definition or a description but
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.080]   could you kind of just summarize like what is prosperity what's that frequency set
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:24.640]   yeah so it basically also has a certain use case right so if
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:32.080]   you want to invite more prosperity in your life and be more in tune with the money flow
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:39.840]   that is a frequency that helps with that and so we had thought about it this quite a bit but it's
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:50.480]   because prosperity and also money they're they're often associated in it in a negative way right
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.040]   so there are even a lot of spiritual people running around on earth that are saying oh you know now
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:01.440]   I don't want any money and never want money's bad and all that no that that's a that's not the
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.560]   the right approach frankly and that has nothing to do with balance that's rather that there's
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:15.360]   something than missing and money is nothing else but but energy right it's nothing nothing else and
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:24.960]   we often have certain blockages towards it or or belief systems that then
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:32.080]   that can go either way right there's often what you would find is there's this oh my god I have
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:37.120]   to get money I have to get money's the the number one thing I have to do and I have to get and
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:44.400]   and there's no satisfaction in life if you don't get the next dollar and all that so that that
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:50.720]   is certainly completely unhealthy right it helps balances that out but it even more so works on
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:57.520]   blockages that we have or belief systems that that we're not worthy of it that the not being
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:03.520]   worthy is actually something that you would find in most all humans and it's interesting and in one
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:12.480]   or in various stages and you know but it's somewhere within ourselves probably everybody could feel
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:20.560]   something where we feel we're not worthy of this or worthy of that and so the frequency really
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:28.400]   works on balancing all that out and to get us in tune with the money flow with our own worth
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:37.280]   and that we can invite that in without having to wanting it or anything just creating it just
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:44.800]   being able to create wealth or prosperity in a nice flow that's basically what this
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:51.120]   frequency helps with and it's again it's a frequency that you know hopefully by using it and
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:25:00.480]   leveraging it you kind of relearn how you can naturally do that wow amazing yeah you know um
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:06.000]   prosperity and money are two separate things some of the happiest people I know are not the
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.600]   wealthiest but yeah okay um that's interesting now this on g power this is obviously it's
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:21.120]   specifically um really focused on prosperity and money flow in that sense uh it's not an
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:26.880]   abundance card because we also have an abundance card that you don't find here yet and abundance
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:34.400]   is goes even further because that is really abundance in in all areas of your life this is a
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:42.160]   so so called like it's really it's specific it really is specific oh okay good to know um
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:48.480]   that's interesting i gotta i gotta try that see what that's like okay now the on g power card
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:55.040]   and that's named after your uh one of your individuals in the healer network right uh yes
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:03.600]   agony and to see him pop that up this is on g right here right there on g fronk frank eikerman
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:09.520]   right uh he's one of your uh like i guess one of your professional healers has been doing it forever
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:19.200]   so he's got a power card what would that look like um yeah what is yeah what what does it do it says
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:26.000]   stimulates your heart chakra it stimulates your heart chakra basically to activate the love to
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.440]   bring it to work as a transformative uh force in your life and we kept this one short because
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:38.000]   the essence is really in in this one sentence that's what it does if you if people can feel or see
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.320]   energies if you hold that card you'll immediately notice that and people can uh easily muscle test
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:52.160]   that for example um and and see what it does to the heart chakra uh if you were this card and um
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:27:00.480]   it's you know the picture how i would describe this is we live in a world where
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:07.120]   most people do something that we kind of need to do or it's we do it because it's kind of the
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:16.240]   the thing that you do but we as a society as a as a human race we're moving towards a new age really
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:23.680]   where we can create and should create out of ourselves and where we should do things out of
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:31.600]   ourselves and it comes kind of out of the inner of our heart if you will and often
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:38.080]   that part is just not activated enough not expanded enough and we don't really focus on
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:44.560]   it and feel it even anymore that's why we just do stuff because it's asked of us or it's the
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:52.880]   normal thing to do here in the world um it helps with us finding opening the doors again of okay
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:58.240]   what's within us what do we want to do and then come from there live your life from there and it
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:04.080]   helps with that and it's that that's definitely a card that one can leverage for many many years
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:10.640]   okay um you know as as we go through these and and let's take a look at unity i'm just
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.680]   wondering if you know like people come to your site and you know first of all the once they kind
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:21.600]   of figure out what's going on um and then depending on where they're at in their life and and what
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:27.360]   their challenges are what their goals are and their dreams um do you have anything that kind of
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:32.720]   helps them choose the right frequency set for where they are at in their life right at that moment
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:37.440]   or is it yeah i'm just kind of wondering because like there's so many choices here i'm just
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:43.200]   wondering how do you help people decide like oh you know the heel obviously is this sounds awesome
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:48.480]   you know from all the different things that it could do versus you know um the power card
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.200]   and i'm kind of wondering like where do they overlap and and how would you like you know
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.120]   tactically use each one of these for the thing that you want it for you know
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.800]   you have any thoughts on that and then we'll get into the unity one
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:08.400]   yeah i think that's it's a great question so i think what what we'll introduce here is a chat
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.240]   function on the website and then i think that will be something if if someone feels uncertain and
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.960]   they know they you know want to work on something and they don't really know and then they could
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:25.520]   they could ask in the chat or send a message and and ask i think that will be a good way
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:33.200]   other than that it's really at this point hard to handle for us to advise everyone individually
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.320]   but you know in the in the quantum power group for example if people ask me there or find me
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:44.080]   there and then send me a direct message i'm happy to help and and look and and help guide in this
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:51.040]   regard for sure and other than that we'll have these descriptions here and as i've had initially
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:56.320]   there's it's two different frequency sets if you will one is really for very specific use cases
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:02.960]   like the sleep and rest card you know it's very clear and yeah some are really clear like they have
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:10.480]   a very targeted use so that exactly yeah yeah and so and i think that something like the unity card
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:17.760]   isn't something for someone that doesn't really bother about inner development
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:22.960]   or spiritual path or any of this and and really just right now has sleep problems right i just you
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:29.520]   know i just want to get rid of that yeah that's different then and so the unity card is is one of
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:36.480]   those cards really for the latter people that are just mentioned and so we're as a as a human race
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:42.880]   again we're moving towards unity and we have unity within us but if you look everywhere
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:53.520]   every everything you perceive is polar right um but yeah about yeah yeah exactly and and but
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:59.360]   it's also because you know we let that happen right so it's i i don't want to point fingers
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:06.080]   at all because it's really on us we can point fingers on us and and we we have the power to change
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:10.080]   it and we can't change it for the world but we can change it for ourselves and then
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:16.000]   that's the first step right and so if you go into meditation for example
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.920]   i mean you don't meditate to then be more polar afterwards right and to be it's it's you meditate
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:31.920]   because you want to feel this unity to get closer to that and this feeling of unity and this expansion
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:37.600]   of of the unity within ourselves and also making meditation easier for example that's what this
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:43.360]   card is is about in a nutshell we have written a lot more here on the page that you can read through
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:53.760]   okay um so okay okay so yeah okay we um we got to talk about how to broadcast this
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:32:00.400]   around the planet uh yeah i've been actually looking in with one of the guys on the chat
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.000]   we're like we're trying to figure out how do you take something like this frequency and then
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.200]   broadcast it uh you know over a whole city or something just because you know our society needs
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:16.640]   this so bad right now uh okay quantum field broadcasting it actually is a thing uh okay so
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:23.680]   so unity is to kind of lessen or mitigate the polarity of the world and in your own home right
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:28.000]   you can have like you between you and your spouse you and your kids this would be a good
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.920]   frequency to have in the home i'm assuming right yes now the Layla card is the last one
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:38.080]   that's like it's not like okay what does that you know what does that one do that's clear so
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:44.960]   how would you best describe this one yeah it has definitely carries aspects of the unity frequency
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:54.160]   but then it it also specifically helps find more ease and lightness in everything that we do
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:33:00.640]   right so often we we take life so serious and yeah i mean there are a lot of serious things that
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:05.280]   are going on and you know that lot of serious things that we're all always personally confronted
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:12.800]   with in a way but it it really helps to find um the space again where we can see that that it's
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:18.560]   all a game right and that's how roman also called it right for him all of this is just a just a game
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:28.480]   and we we're players right creators and players on this big field here and if if we lose the ability
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:35.040]   to see that and to get into this playfulness we also lose a lot of joy and happiness in the life so
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:44.080]   to stimulate that flow and to help remember that we're here to also explore things and to be curious
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:55.600]   and to find joy in what we do um and this is what this chord helps with okay okay so very different
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:01.360]   specifics but okay yeah it is you know right off the bat i mean i could see where they're very
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:07.120]   specifically geared and for those of you that have something going on in your life whether it's
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:14.880]   loss you know divorce whatever and if you have real questions and you can't figure it out then
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:22.080]   you know jump on the telegram and then and ask away we've got the there's a new power quantum
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:28.240]   power group on telegram link below which ties to the website here but okay so that's great um
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:33.200]   any other things you want to add about frequencies and then we'll get into the testing
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:40.000]   that was very yeah i think we're now we've we've we've we've covered it we have more to come uh so
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.480]   we already have a few in the pipeline but for now we also didn't want to overwhelm um the community
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:53.920]   and uh i think uh this is a good set and again ask your questions in in the chat and and also in
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.560]   the quantum power channel on youtube we'll we'll cover a little bit more and by the way just one
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:04.000]   word for that that's it's supposed to be not just about uh the like quantum tech products right now
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.320]   it's just because we're starting this channel but there's there's going to be a whole variety of
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:14.080]   topics and and and people involved in that regard yeah you know it'd be really cool to do
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.560]   interviews of your healer network i'm not me but you know you guys doing it on your youtube channel
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.480]   just to hear what these other folks think and say and um because you know just kind of like
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:27.040]   introduce your healer network you know that'd be really kind of cool little 10 minute snippets
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:32.400]   about these these incredible people uh that sounds good starting to just pop them um i have uh ideas
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:38.800]   pop it in my head constantly all right one card we didn't talk about it's this uh is this neutral
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:45.440]   energy card so what would you do with a first of all it's just uh a card that you charged with just
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:50.720]   neutral energy right so what would you do with the neutral energy card uh if are we left that one
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:56.400]   off yeah so i mean if you don't want to work with a specific frequency and you just want to get a
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:04.080]   little uh boost of that and some people you know it's definitely not the majority but some people
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:12.720]   are very very sensitive to energy and if they wanted to um just have a little bit more quantum
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:19.520]   energy available to them and get used to it and work with it that's what this card is for um you
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:26.640]   know by itself already it provides benefit because quantum energy is positive quote and say
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:34.480]   positive right uh it's it's helpful and supportive but it's again it's it's neutral so yeah whoever
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:39.840]   feels drawn to that uh definitely try that okay awesome so that's very helpful really helpful
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:46.080]   thank you again thank you k and thanks for everybody for watching and yeah if you're interested
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:52.720]   uh you know take a look and be engaged talk about it if you have questions feel free to reach out
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:37:02.800]   any time yep and so again the uh the website is leleqq.com so leleqq.com um and then we also are on
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:09.280]   telegram or phillips on telegram with a quantum power quantum power group is it called group
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:15.440]   group uh quantum power group yeah uh for all things quantum energy and look for a lot more
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.640]   to come on that telegram group all right well thank you very much everyone and have a good day
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.720]   thank you phillip thank you
