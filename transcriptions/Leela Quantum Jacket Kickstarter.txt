[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   Aloha, everyone, and welcome to another video.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.480]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer, here at the Tinkers Academy, and I've got Philip Von Holson-Dorf
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.200]   with Leila Quantum Tech on the Line, here to introduce the new Leila Quantum jacket,
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.360]   and he's doing a Kickstarter, so, you know, it's a really great concept, a really great
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.360]   new product, and I really wanted to share it with everybody.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.720]   And even more so, let's talk about EMF because that's what this jacket helps you with.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.960]   So, this video is about the Leila Quantum jacket and its Kickstarter helping supporting
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.080]   our bodies against the harmful effects of EMF and look good doing it.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.720]   So, before we jump into that, I want to do a quick disclaimer that neither Leila Quantum
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.120]   Tech nor the Tinkers Academy recommend or endorse any specific tests, physicians, procedures,
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.920]   opinions, or other information that may be mentioned in this video, reliance on any
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.120]   information appearing, and discussed in this video solely at everyone's own risk.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.040]   This may have not been evaluated by the EFSA or FDA or any government derivatives thereof.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.840]   Leila Quantum Tech products and products that Leila Quantum Tech may represent are
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.560]   not intended to diagnose, treat, care, or prevent any disease.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.040]   All right, so there's that.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.320]   So, the first thing I want to say about Leila Quantum Tech and Philip is that Leila Quantum
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.560]   Tech is supported by a group of very renowned healers of which Philip is one of, and so,
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.400]   it's all of these different individuals with all varied backgrounds of working in the health
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.720]   and wellness space for years and years and years have come together and put their experience
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.640]   and their talent together to create some of the most unique, and I'd say just advanced
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.080]   products that are out there on the market, and I'm just really enthralled by it, and
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.840]   I'm very interested in what these things can do, because I actually have been tinkering
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.840]   around with them.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.120]   That's why I'm so excited to share them on my channel.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.080]   So, today, one of the members of the Healer Network is Philip, some more von Holtsendorff,
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.880]   and he's on the line right now, and so he and Philip wanted to say welcome, good morning,
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.920]   and I pulled this bio off of your website, and so I just would like you to just, I'm
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.200]   just going to quote a couple of things I think are really interesting, and then just let
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.160]   you introduce yourself, but Philip is a coach, a conscious entrepreneur, an alpha-cheat teacher
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.840]   and an energy healer.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.720]   Your core competency is transform energy blockages and open hidden treasures within oneself,
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.200]   and what's really cool is that you specialize in working with people through your other entrepreneurial
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.240]   businesses, one's called the Path of Love, helping people kind of find their true self,
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.440]   I think the simplest way to say it right, through their inner nature and their consciousness,
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.840]   and there's your other business called Layla Labs, which you have a full product line
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.400]   of C60 products, C60 oil and C60 topicals, and then as well now, you've got this Layla
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.320]   quantum tech, so good morning, and is there anything else that you kind of want to add
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.480]   to kind of just let people know who you are and what your background is?
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.640]   Thanks so much, Kay, for having me, I'm looking forward to this, really am, and thanks for
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.440]   the introduction, I think it really covers it from my perspective.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.580]   When I was interviewed last week, the one interviewing said, "Hey, you're underselling
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.320]   yourself, weren't you a vice president at T-Mobile?
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.320]   We should mention this."
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.280]   And I was like, "Well, you can mention it if you want, it's for me not very important,
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.960]   but it may in this case be important for some people to hear that I was in the telecommunications
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:47.240]   industry in Europe and in the US, because we're talking about EMF, so it's not that I'm completely
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.480]   new to this stuff, and yeah, that may be the only thing to add, but it's the past."
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.680]   That would definitely mean you understand EMF and wireless and all of those things.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.680]   That's pretty cool.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.360]   Yeah, I think I heard that, and I didn't connect that till just when you just said that now,
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.440]   but I do want to point out that Philip is battle scarred like myself.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.120]   He has two children, one is a teenager, and I think he's 19, so you've survived.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.800]   We have one that just turned 18, and the other one is 13.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.560]   Okay, so yeah, so you've got the battle scars, and you survived.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.040]   My daughter's 21, so I think any man and woman who has survived their children being teenagers
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:37.760]   is definitely, you've got the scars to prove it, and you survived, so hey, congratulations
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.280]   to you and you and everyone always jokes that the newborns are the hard ones, nah.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.440]   I have a teenager, so we'll have to have a chat one day, which one's worst teenage
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.600]   boy or teenage girl, but yeah, so he's a father as well, so hey, well welcome.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.880]   So you know, let's talk about the Kickstarter, so right now, this is what the Kickstarter
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.960]   page looks like, just want to share.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.520]   This is the Layla Q website, and right here is this early bird offer, and so if you jump
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.720]   into here, you pop right over to the Kickstarter page.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.920]   So hey, you know, Philip, this is kind of a new concept for a business that's already
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.120]   running and selling multiple products to actually do a Kickstarter on the side, so I was just
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.240]   kind of wondering, like, so what's this Kickstarter about and what made you think about doing
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.240]   it this way?
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.320]   Yeah, great question.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:42.120]   So we thought about it quite some time ago actually, and we're thinking about an EMF protective
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.400]   jacket that's all also quantum energy infused and therefore is great for well-being and
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.800]   the blood and all of that, and when we were thinking about it, we were realizing, well,
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.040]   you know, this will be the world's first quantum jacket, and on top of that, it's really also
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:09.400]   the world's first real EMF protection jacket that's out there, maybe there's something
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.360]   out there, I think you couldn't find anything, maybe there is something out there that, you
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.880]   know, but there's definitely nothing in the fashion side, you know, maybe you look like
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.000]   a nerd if you were what's available or you do something like homemade.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.120]   No, I check, there's nothing out there, I looked all over, because, well, I won't interrupt
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.800]   you, sorry, but I'll talk about that later, go ahead, keep talking.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:45.520]   Yeah, and Kickstarter is just a phenomenal platform to let people know about completely
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:55.560]   new inventions and products, and we're a small company obviously, and Kickstarter just offers
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:03.600]   this opportunity to get this out there to a broader audience, and also to make people
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:10.960]   aware of it that may not have pwned us otherwise, but that may be very interested in this, especially
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.440]   in the current times, I think a jacket like this comes in pretty handy.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:22.640]   So that's why we chose Kickstarter, and then we started to, you know, refining the jacket,
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:30.240]   making it as good and protective and helpful as we possibly could, and also that it looks
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.200]   really great, so we went through multiple iterations, and then in parallel, we basically
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.360]   ramped up these efforts to launch the Kickstarter campaign, which is quite a project in and
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.360]   of itself.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.360]   It was a lot of work.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.280]   It's a first Kickstarter you've done, I mean, I've never actually done one, I've supported
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.880]   several, I think most people have, right, so where, you know, I guess most people are
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.280]   familiar with the Kickstarter, but is this your first one that you've ever done?
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.080]   Yes, that's the first one.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.880]   Yeah, how long does it take to set up?
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.560]   Well, I mean, it depends on how you define set up.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.440]   So just to launch it in the end, that was a clicking a button for a second, but all the
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:15.120]   work that went in until I could press that button to launch it was, yeah, multiple weeks,
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.840]   and, you know, we've planned, planned it and worked on it for a few months.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.880]   But I mean, not obviously like full-time, right, so there's definitely several weeks
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.160]   of work going into this.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.280]   Yeah, so the whole concept behind Kickstarter is basically trying to, you know, raise capital
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.600]   for a new product, basically.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.800]   So you know, I know that you're a very small startup entrepreneurial company with Layla
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.760]   Quantum Tech, working with all your, you know, friends on the healer network.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:49.040]   So basically this is an effort to launch a new product and raise the capital to do so,
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.680]   where as capital is raised, as you sell product, then you've raised the money to then go ahead
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.040]   and create the product and ship it.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.680]   And that's so you'll be, I was reading the website, so you'll be, you'll be shipping
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.720]   the first, I guess they call it the first wave or something of jackets in May and then
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.280]   the, and if they raise enough capital, you'll, you know, the second wave will come out in
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.760]   June of this year, is that correct?
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.760]   That is correct.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.640]   And that's actually pretty fast for a Kickstarter.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:22.120]   And the reason is because we've completely developed the jacket that's all ready to go.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.080]   So it's working perfectly, it's been certified and all of that and tested and studied.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.840]   And so we're already running the production.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:36.360]   So, and, and then, you know, as the campaign moves forward, we're ramping that up.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.000]   So we try to make it as fast as possible for people.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.720]   So people don't need to wait for three or six months here, like in, in several other
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.720]   projects.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:51.840]   Yeah, I've actually been in projects where they never launched because you got the product
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.880]   and that's, that's a go.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.040]   So that's really cool.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.440]   I mean, it is really cool.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.920]   And I'm really happy to be a part of it.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.960]   So I've already signed myself up as a backer and I just want to say go for it, you know,
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.600]   I support you.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.400]   And then let's talk about the jacket because in our pre discussion, Philip and I were chatting
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:14.520]   about the jacket and, and so, okay, so this is what I want to point out is that the first
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.880]   wave comes out in May, the second wave comes out in June.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.760]   And so, you know, I was talking to my daughter about it.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.200]   And I just wanted to, I was asking her if she wants one.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.280]   And her first thought was like, well, you know, how warm is it because she looked at
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:30.880]   the picture and thought, oh, if I got this jacket in May, you know, is it, is it, you
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.840]   know, is it, am I ever going to use it until like next winter, right?
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:40.200]   And so, Philip, you were mentioning that this is, it's, it's a poofy winter looking jacket,
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.000]   but it's really not a full on winter jacket or could you kind of talk about the jacket
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.360]   itself as a jacket?
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.360]   Yes.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.640]   So, and first of all, it's very comfortable and it's really awesome.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.000]   It looks really comfortable.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.320]   Yeah, I've been wearing it a lot.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:01.400]   So because I have the, one of the prototypes here and you can actually wear it most of
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.400]   the years.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.040]   So this is a jacket that works well in the spring and the fall in cold summer days as
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.000]   well as in the winter, however, not in deep winter.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.760]   Like if you, if you go skiing, you could wear it if it's a warmer ski day, if you will,
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.760]   right?
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.240]   You know, I have those in March and all that.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:29.720]   But if it's really deep winter, then you want to have a, yeah, warmer jacket.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.280]   Okay.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.280]   And so the thing, okay.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.880]   So it's, it's, it's like a light winter spring fall jacket.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.880]   Okay.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.880]   Cool.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.320]   Well, I'm going to tell her on that because it looks really super thick and warm.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.320]   But you know what?
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.320]   So what's, okay.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.740]   So if there's two components to the jacket, you know, I read, I read all the material
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.740]   about it.
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:54.520]   One, it's an EMF shielded fabric, which makes it like EMF shielding.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.720]   And then the second thing is you've charged it using your, you know, using your tools
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.160]   with quantum energy, right?
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.480]   So, now as I was going through it, so what makes this jacket special is I guess it's
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.560]   made, it's like it's, it's got a purity or I'm sorry, silver.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.640]   So there's silver threads sewn into the, into the fabric.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.700]   And that's what provides the shielding, right?
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.700]   Yeah.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:26.000]   So the, the inner part of the jacket is to a large extent, this special 99.9 purity
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.840]   silver fabric that we use, which just in and of itself, without any charging blocks over
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:45.200]   99.9% of any EMF and it's antimicrobial and odor neutral and antibacterial and all that.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.600]   So that's, that's that material.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:54.200]   And it's actually, as you can see here on the picture, also in the hood, which adds another
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.280]   layer of protection, if you want to, you know, just, you know, protect your head.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.400]   And yeah, that's what we've basically come up with.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:09.080]   And then the outside is not the silver fabric, because, you know, we wanted to look good also
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.080]   and great.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.520]   I mean, the inside looks great as is, but it would be a little odd if it would be silver
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.920]   on the outside as well.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.920]   Okay.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.920]   Is it waterproof or is it like, you know, you know, some jackets are kind of like water
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.920]   resistant?
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.160]   It's somewhat water resistant.
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:31.400]   I think it has just like a one, two, or three percent absorption at most.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.400]   Okay.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.280]   You know, I want, I just do want to, I want to reiterate that, you know, I went looking
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:41.120]   all over last night to see if there's any comparable products and there is, there's only one thing
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.240]   that will pop up under EMF jacket and it is nothing like this at all.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.280]   It's just really this strange trench coat thing.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.760]   But so this is really cool, this is the first of its kind, EMF jacket.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.880]   And then let's talk about the whole quantum energy aspect of it.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.840]   So what have you done to the jacket that, you know, really like lifts it up in terms
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:07.240]   of its ability to protect people from the harmful effects of EMF?
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:15.720]   So we, for people that have not heard, we have two products called the Quantum Block
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.800]   and the infinity block.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:23.240]   We also have larger versions of that here for us, again, those are, that's the actual
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:31.040]   technology that we use to infuse pure quantum energy into objects.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:39.200]   And so this jacket, when you receive it, has been charged with pure quantum energy in
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.440]   these devices.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.200]   And so they will hold this quantum energy permanently.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.600]   The silver is actually an amazing part of this because you could just have a regular
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:58.080]   jacket and charge it, but then it doesn't hold the quantum energy as well.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:07.160]   And it also doesn't transmit the quantum energy nearly as well as the silver does.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:13.880]   So this has, it's just like a double whammy, it's super awesome to use silver for something
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.400]   like that.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:25.400]   And what it does, it then transmits this positive energy to the body of the wearer.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:35.840]   And it has been shown in multiple studies that it has fairly amazing effects on well-being,
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.160]   can help in general on the blood.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.640]   I think we'll get into that a little deeper.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.840]   And yeah, so that's why you also feel a little bit more energy, you feel pretty energized
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.800]   when you wear it.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.840]   And so that's very unique.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.440]   Yeah, sounds okay.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:02.200]   So I know that, okay, so if anyone who's got questions about what this energy is, Phillip
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:07.560]   and I did a chat about a month or two ago where we really talked in depth about the
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.320]   energy and what it's all about.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.120]   I'll go ahead and link that in the video description below along with the links to the website
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.720]   and Kickstarter and so forth.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.960]   So that's an entirely unique discussion.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.800]   But what I want to do is let you know that at the end of the video, we're going to actually
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:26.600]   show you some of the results of what this energy or what the effects of the energy are
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.120]   to human blood cells.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:36.680]   So it's a real physical impact and it is a real actual thing when Phillip says quantum
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:42.160]   energy, it sounds a little new agey, but when you see what it really does and it really
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.400]   does it in the physical world, it's impossible to say that it doesn't exist.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.240]   So that's really cool.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.080]   I got one more question about the jacket because I know someone's going to ask and I'm curious
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.160]   too, but what are the washing instructions?
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.880]   If you wash this thing, does it decrease its effectiveness over time?
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.680]   Is there anything that you would say?
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.480]   I'm definitely going to get one for my daughter, I just want to make sure she doesn't mess
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.480]   it up.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.560]   Yep, it's a good question.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:21.760]   So like with any of our quantum clothing items, you can wash it at 30 degrees centigrade
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   at most.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   So that is...
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.160]   About 100 degrees, right?
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.740]   No, I think that's less than 100 degrees.
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:36.200]   It's somewhere rather around 90, 86 or something like that, we'll have to look it up, but more
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.760]   around that.
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:47.760]   And so maybe just a cold wash, I think in the U.S. maybe warm would also work, it depends
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.200]   probably on the washer and it should not be put in the dryer.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.640]   So that's basically it.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.760]   So no hot water and it stays clean.
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.760]   All right.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.760]   Okay, great.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:04.400]   So one of the things that I do want to next chat about and just share this with everybody
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.680]   is a lot of the products that you're selling on your website, I noticed, and especially
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:18.280]   this jacket is all geared towards the mitigation of the effects of EMF.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:23.720]   And so I'm kind of just would like to ask you if you could kind of share with everybody,
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:31.600]   why have you chosen this particular effect as something to wrap a lot of your products
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.600]   around me?
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.760]   Why EMF?
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.960]   What makes you interested in helping people about EMF?
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.480]   What are your thoughts?
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.480]   Good question.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:47.840]   I think it's become one more problem for people.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:54.600]   I think if you listen to a lot of the doctors that speak the truth and people that are pretty
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:02.240]   involved in this and have run studies or have looked at studies, they would all tell
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:11.200]   you that EMF is one of the main contributors, some would even say it's the main contributor
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:20.760]   to bad human health and also bad health in regards to animals, talking about bees and
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.760]   other animals.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.520]   Bees may be an example that people have heard about.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:33.760]   And it's gotten worse over time, so we're really living in a soup of EMF nowadays.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:39.200]   It wasn't really the case 20, 30 years ago.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:46.280]   And so with this whole mobile phone movement, it kind of started, right, and then we went
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.280]   to 3G.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:54.200]   3G was already proven a long, long time ago as being absolutely detrimental to the health
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.120]   of the human body.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.440]   I mean, we could go into real details, but there are literally hundreds and hundreds
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.480]   of studies in regards to that.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:14.040]   And then 4G, then 5G, and 5G is a little bit different than the other G's because it works
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:26.400]   in a different way, it has a way to pulse the data that it does it in a non-natural way.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.520]   For us, it's not natural.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.840]   And what a lot of people don't know is that with all the 5G towers that are being rolled
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:42.600]   out, 3G is being rolled out at the same time, more or less in the backpack of 5G.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.400]   And it's not really being talked about.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:51.480]   I couldn't really find a lot about that anywhere I was trying to find, but I couldn't.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.080]   And 3G is very bad at the time.
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:59.000]   It wasn't that bad because it was not all over the place, now that it's going to be
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.880]   all over the place and we already know what 3G does, it's actually not good.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:09.320]   Now, I want to mention that I'm not one of those people that says this is terrible for
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.320]   everybody and there's nothing that can be done.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:18.080]   I actually know for a fact, if you're very tuned in with yourself and live a very conscious
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:23.880]   life, the more you are in tune with yourself, the less it actually needs to bother you.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:29.440]   And none of the healers, for example, that we work with are bothered by EMF.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.400]   It's just, is that way?
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:40.240]   However, over 90% of the population, likely more than 95% of the population, isn't at
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:45.800]   that state of someone that has always lived a completely conscious life and is fully expanded
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.480]   with their consciousness.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:54.600]   So they are affected and there are thousands of studies that show that if anybody is interested,
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:01.840]   you can Google bio-initiative report 2012 or bio-initiative 2012 report.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:07.400]   It's hard to find it on Google anywhere, but if you type that in, you'll find it.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:12.000]   If you don't find it on Google anymore, then use duck duck go.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.460]   And that's an amazing compilation.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:20.000]   It's actually from 2012 onwards, it's been updated every year and it's a compilation
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:30.120]   of, I think, around about 2000 extensive studies all around radiation and EMF impacts and
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.760]   health impacts and all of that.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:40.640]   And then there's also, I think, an appeal that has been signed by way over 300,000 scientists
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:46.560]   from over 220 nations to actually stop 5G.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:55.520]   So I'm not advocating here to stop 5G, even though that may not be a bad idea if we could
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.520]   go with some alternatives.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:02.040]   However, the point is that there is a lot of awareness out there.
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.720]   It's just not in the mainstream, really.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.200]   But there is a lot of awareness, there are real health effects.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:16.480]   And we also, in our studies, found out that over 90%, way over 90% of the people that
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:22.920]   are exposed to EMF are negatively impacted in their physical health and even in their
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.800]   bio-energetic state.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:31.640]   So that's one of the reasons why we said, okay, we can't make 5G go away now.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.020]   And that's also not really our goal.
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:40.360]   But how can we make life easier for people and make it easier for people so that their
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:46.640]   bodies don't need to fight constantly against all these things, but actually be in a state
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.760]   where the body can focus on its original tasks.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:57.760]   And yeah, that's why we created this whole concept in the first place.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.400]   Oh, it's great.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:07.400]   That coming from a former telecom executive is very powerful.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:16.560]   And if I can add just a couple of things, I've been an EMF sensitive person forever.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:22.000]   And what 20-something years ago started out as a quest to just be able to sleep through
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.040]   the night as something as simple as I just wanted to sleep through the night and start
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.040]   looking at all the various things that would affect my ability to sleep.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:38.520]   I ran across EMF, and I have actually been a very, very strong anti-EMF individual for
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.320]   all those years.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.240]   And I want to point out something, and I'm also a huge advocate for bio-electrical magnetic
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.040]   healing modalities and devices as some of you may have seen with some of my electrical
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.040]   healing videos.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:57.080]   What I want to add, Phillip, is that electromagnetic frequencies are both good and bad.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:03.280]   And that here's, if you look at the range of the frequencies from left to right, there's
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:09.280]   this very narrow band right at the very beginning at the extremely low frequencies, 50-60 hertz
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.760]   and below, that are actually earthbound frequencies, especially as people may have known, like
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:20.360]   the human residence, which is the Earth's own frequency at 7.83 hertz.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:25.440]   So right here is where we are literally tied to our mother, and it's part of who we are,
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.160]   and that we're born into this frequency.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.560]   And then NASA and the other space agencies have determined that if you take a human being
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:38.040]   outside of this field, that they were raised in, it affects them negatively, physically.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.520]   So this is a very healthy band right here in the very, but everything between that band
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.920]   and natural sunlight, the whole idea of red light that you need to have red light, the
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:53.080]   reason that we have cold and flu season, or used to, it's because people weren't getting
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:54.920]   enough sunlight.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:26:00.000]   So it's a very healthy band of electromagnetic frequency, but what's happened is that there's
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.160]   this artificial band right in here between, let's say, 60 hertz all the way up to natural
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:12.400]   sunlight, and then beyond that, you've got ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, essentially.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.080]   So one of the things I wanted to add, Phillip, and especially this is interesting to hear
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.440]   about the cell phone thing, but I want to point out to anyone, and I don't mean this
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:26.360]   at all, to be fear mongering, fear mongering, or doom porn or anything like that.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:32.080]   I just want to just share what I've observed for 20 years, and that is, is that in the
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:38.080]   beginning, when we had flip phones, this is a great diagram, by the way, I found it, you
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:42.600]   know, you could shield the phone by putting it in a pouch or you could put it in a wallet
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:47.080]   or, you know, and now today, in today's world, you can, you know, do other things, but you
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:51.160]   could shield yourself from the phone, and then everybody started getting Wi-Fi, and
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:55.600]   you could shield yourself against the Wi-Fi in your house by just turning it off, and
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.440]   then you've got cell phone towers, and there's ways to go, and there's different companies
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:05.720]   out there that sell shielded paint, shielding materials you can put on your windows and
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.160]   your walls, and things like that.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.560]   And so in the beginning, and I have a video, I have a page on this on my blog, where someone
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.800]   asked me once, like, what do I do for shielding?
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.560]   And so I did a little quickie video, and if anybody wants to see it, it's on my blog,
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:23.160]   and, you know, on how I shielded my house, when the building across the way for me decided
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.640]   to put a microwave antenna on top of their building, and so that was like 10 years ago,
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.640]   so what did I do about it, right?
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.640]   And then also how to deal with, like, something called dirty electricity and all that.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:38.040]   And so, you know, actual physical shielding was practical and necessary, if you really
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:44.200]   wanted to kind of not be irradiated all the time, so, but the thing I want to point out,
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.240]   and thanks for letting me go on this monologue here, is the satellites, the issue of the
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.880]   satellites now.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.320]   Because the idea that you could once shield yourself from cell phones, you could shield
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:00.280]   yourself from Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi antennas and go out and buy the paint and all of that,
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.880]   yeah, that's all great for when you're inside your home, but when you're outside your home,
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:09.840]   you know, we're at a point now where you cannot shield yourself from it, because with the
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.480]   advent of the satellites, and this is something I just want to point out to anybody who doesn't
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:18.260]   know about it, is if you've ever heard of the Starlink project, Philip, have you heard
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.260]   about this project?
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.260]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:26.320]   Yeah, it's, you know, Elon Musk, love that guy, right, yeah, you know, SpaceX, right?
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:31.240]   Well, what Elon's done with his subsidiary called Starlink is they've decided that they're
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:38.340]   going to bring 5G cell phone and internet, right, to the planet, to the whole planet.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:43.840]   And so as of, this article is as of March 1st this year, 2021.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:48.740]   And so the article basically says, hey, you know what, the Starlink project is now up
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:55.760]   to, I guess right here, it's, you know, they first, the whole project was to put out a blanket
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:02.200]   of satellites around the planet that would then be broadcasting 24 hours a day everywhere
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:07.980]   you go, you know, 5G and basically Wi-Fi internet access.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:13.040]   And so as of March 1st, they have, they have over a thousand satellites have already been
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.700]   delivered into orbit.
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:21.720]   There's already a thousand up there and that, okay, now, so as of, okay, as of February,
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:30.000]   I'm sorry, as of February, there's 1,300 SpaceX or Starlink satellites in orbit now broadcasting
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.320]   Wi-Fi, okay.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.060]   And the goal, and this is what's terrifying.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:42.520]   The goal is once they get up to, you know, it's 1,300, but the goal right now is 30,000.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.240]   And that's just Starlink.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.120]   And there's other companies, there's an Indian company, there's one in Europe, and these
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.840]   other companies, they also want to be grabbing territory.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.640]   There's a big land rush right now, you want to call it a land rush, right, Phillip?
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.560]   Because you're the telecom guy, right?
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:02.800]   But I mean, we're talking about just one company alone is going to have 30,000 internet
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   satellites up there.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.480]   And they're only going to be going between 45 and 50 degrees north latitude.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.000]   You've got the Indian company that's going to, that wants to blanket India the subcontinent.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.240]   You've got a European company that wants to blanket Europe and so forth.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:21.800]   And we're going to have, I would easily guess what, over 100,000 satellites up above us
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.480]   over the next 10 years, easy, right?
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.040]   I mean, would you agree with that?
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.920]   Yes, I would agree with that.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.280]   And it's indeed a massive amount.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:36.360]   It can be shocking to hear this and probably a lot of people who are not aware that this
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.880]   is happening.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:43.600]   However, again, it's something that, you know, we can't do anything about that right
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:51.520]   now and we need to adapt as humans, we are able to always adapt to things.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:59.280]   However, in the time where it's the hardest to adapt is when you're first blasted with
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.240]   all of that, right?
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:06.200]   And you're, as you said, you're, by the way, that was a great overview of the history of
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.360]   how this all developed.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.560]   And now we're out there naked in the open, basically, right?
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:18.120]   And there's nothing you can do other than to adapt with your consciousness and be as
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:27.040]   healthy as you can and then leverage tools like the ones that we are working on so that
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.160]   you don't have an issue with it.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.280]   That's basically all that can be done.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:36.440]   We can't, yeah, we can't do anything about those satellites at this point.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:44.680]   Hopefully, at some point, there will be either technology used that this doesn't even affect
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:49.160]   us in a negative way while we're also adapting.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:56.920]   So that's, or that it stops in something even more powerful and at the same time, good for
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.800]   the human health will be invented and developed.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.440]   So that's my hope.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.840]   And that, you know, I just want to emphasize, you know, that's why I appreciate Layla Quantum
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:11.760]   Tech so much because they've, they're not out there just, you know, selling pendants
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.760]   and things.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:18.620]   They're really trying to help with their entire focus on EMF for the reasons I just
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:19.620]   stated.
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:24.680]   So my first point is that if you think you can get away from it or shield yourself from
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.720]   it, that's not going to be possible.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.400]   And it's, that's, and we're ready there.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.640]   If you live in a city and for those of folks that are living out in the country, you know,
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.640]   hey, what, there's no way to hide from it when there's a hundred thousand satellites
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.360]   above your head, you know.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:42.640]   And then, you know, it's, it's, and so that's just my first point and a second point that
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:47.200]   I want to make is the research that I did and anyone can do this.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.120]   So I, you know, I don't recommend using Google.
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:54.680]   So I'm a duck duck go also or I X quick is my other go to search engine.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:33:00.760]   So if you go to a search engine that's reliable, that doesn't censor your search results and
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.880]   you just say, what are the symptoms of exposure to EMF?
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.120]   And you'll just, or you then, okay, this is where I use Google.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:12.000]   I do use Google for Google, Google Scholar, Google patents.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.440]   It seems to be the only reliable, you know, they're, they're really helpful.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.720]   So much as I hate Google.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:21.840]   But if you go to these websites and you look up studies, you look up the effects.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.240]   One of the things I want to point out because before we talk about the test results, I want
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.160]   to kind of level set and, you know, what's the, and set a benchmark so that everybody
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.680]   understands what we're looking at here in a second.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:37.840]   But when I'd researched all of this for, for this discussion with Phillip, you know, I
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.840]   just bullet it out.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.480]   I mean, literally just reading and reading and reeling and made a bullet list of all
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.920]   of the various symptoms that are in studies and of, of, you know, this is not anecdotal.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:53.360]   This is studies of people exposed to all the different, you know, forms of radiation,
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.680]   you know, EMF radiation that they can get.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.520]   And then what are the, what's the list of things that happen to people?
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.480]   And it's everything from headaches, which I used to suffer from headaches, but I, I wear
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.760]   a shielded hat whenever I'm not in my home and my home has a metal roof.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.200]   So I'm okay at home.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.920]   But if I go outside, I have to wear a shielded hat or I get headaches.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.240]   I'm one of those folks, right?
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:17.840]   But everything from cardiac dysregulation, depression, skin rashes, I mean, it's all
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.840]   over the map.
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:24.520]   But the one thing that is related to the tests that were done on the Leila Quantum jacket
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:29.840]   and the Leila Quantum energy itself is where they looked at the red blood cells.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:35.680]   And so one of the things that you'll find in EMF literature is that EMF causes what
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:42.600]   they call it induces the, the Rolo formulation or formation in red blood cells and Rolo is
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.960]   French word for roles.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:44.960]   Okay.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.440]   So it creates like these little coin rolls out of red blood cells.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:54.720]   And so what that does when it creates that formation of red blood cells into little clusters
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:00.600]   or called coin, you know, coin rolls, Rolo is that causes oxygen deprivation of within
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.240]   your blood because your red blood cells are required.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:07.200]   You know, that's what transmits oxygen throughout your entire body.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:12.480]   And so what happens when you have a blood clusters, Rolo formation in your red blood
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:18.080]   cells, when you're exposed to EMF and you're exposed to EMF all the time, 24 hours a day.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.760]   And so now you go into like, what happens?
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.760]   Well, you get into this oxygen deprivation aspect.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.760]   And then here's, and then, okay, go in and you go back into the search engines and start
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.660]   researching oxygen deprivation.
[00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.000]   So I did all of that too.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.240]   And the next step in the thought process was, okay, what happens if I'm deprived of oxygen?
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.840]   And you get into some serious issues with your health.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:42.720]   And I think one of the most important things that people don't realize is that chronic
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:49.880]   diseases that's tied to oxygen deprivation, which is tied to EMF.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:54.560]   And I think that's one of the things about, and I mentioned this in our last chat, Philip,
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.160]   which was just by serendipity.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:01.960]   You know, I follow another individual who's electro sensitive and his name is Lloyd and
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:08.760]   he has this great blog called ElectroSense and he had a guest, a doctor, a guest speaker
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.920]   on a couple of weeks ago.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:17.840]   And she had done a tremendous amount of research on the effects of EMF on blood and then all
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.040]   of the chronic diseases that were tied to that blood.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.880]   And it's just, it's so, I think it's just starting to come out now because, you know,
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:30.920]   when you look at this chart right here, you realize that, you know, when did this stuff
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:35.000]   get invented and this stuff got invented after World War II, right?
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   I mean, we only started using satellites, I'm sorry, not satellites, but radar, radar
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.280]   was invented in World War II because the British needed to keep track of the Germans, right?
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.600]   So they, that's when we invented radar and started using radar in World War II.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.520]   So it's only been 80 years.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:57.280]   So the planet has been EMF free for all this time and we've been living in harmonious nature
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:03.840]   right with nature. And then for the last 80 years, we've induced this man-made creation.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.040]   And now all of a sudden, everything you read is we've got, you know, epidemic of obesity
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.240]   and diabetes and heart disease and all that, right?
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.520]   And so you start to wonder, is there a correlation? And my personal opinion, I think there is.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:20.680]   I really think that the industrial age on top of the digital age is causing a lot of
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:24.160]   health problems. And I think that, again, and I don't mean to be fear-mongering, it's
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.640]   just my opinion. But when you do the research, it's almost undeniable.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.080]   I mean, what's your thoughts on just that aspect or that concept?
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:38.200]   Yeah, I mean, you're absolutely not alone with that. The mainstream is alone with their
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:45.080]   perspective to not to ignore it. But if you listen to people like Dr. Klinghard, for example,
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:51.160]   out of the Seattle areas, he's one of the most respected doctors around the globe.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:56.840]   I mean, he's well known all over Europe. He's known in the US. He's the man to go to if
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:02.560]   you have Lyme disease and lots of other stuff. And he tells you straight in the face that
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:07.760]   EMF is responsible for the huge increase of autoimmune diseases.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:16.360]   So yeah, I think you're pretty much spot on. It's definitely a factor at minimum.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:21.040]   Yeah. And you know, and just my last point here is you see this right there? Yeah, that's
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:27.640]   how I got into EMF, typical tea sleeping is a symptom. I can't even tell you how much
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.000]   money and time I've spent on trying to get a sleep, decent night's sleep.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.480]   So I'm going to leave everybody with that thought and the thought of, you know, what
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:40.200]   is EMF and what is its threat to our health and, you know, and just what does the future
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:44.800]   look like? And so with that thought, let's talk about the test results. And then this
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:50.040]   is where it gets so cool, because you just don't see this anywhere else. But the test
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:55.040]   results, and basically you've had a test by a couple of different institutes. One of
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.320]   them is called BESA. So we'll just, we're just going to focus in on the BESA testing
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:04.480]   initially, and without making this video too long. And so I want, I just want to point
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:10.240]   out that I read some of the studies and that you gave me and really, and just for the audience,
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:16.600]   it's a really simple before and after study. Okay. So this, the concept is simple. It's,
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:22.560]   it takes someone and we, 100% of us are this before picture, honestly, where we're subjected
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.780]   to, we're all carrying a phone and we're all living in a Wi-Fi field. On top of that,
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:31.960]   a lot of us live in a, in an electrical field, I live in a building. So I'm surrounded by
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.960]   all the wires within the building, in a home, not so bad. Still, you got a lot of wiring,
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:42.140]   but nothing like me, right, living in a condominium. And then even worse, I live within a quarter
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:46.720]   mile of Honolulu International Airport. And so for those of you who live near airports,
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:52.860]   you've got a huge extra factor of EMF that you may not realize. And that is the, the radar
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:58.420]   and all the telecommunications coming off of, off of an airport. It's huge. Their radar
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:03.980]   that they use is constantly beaming radiation onto you. So, so the average person is, is,
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:10.140]   is in a state of EMF, you know, you know, problematic EMF. And then the, then you did
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:16.860]   the study, the studies was take a look at someone's blood before and then after. Okay. So, Phillip,
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:25.900]   can you just, I, I, I pulled up two different tests that you sent me from the Bessah Institute
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:30.660]   of the, of the blood. And then the blood is a, what they call a dark field microscopy,
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:37.820]   fancy word for looking at blood under a microscope. And so I, these two subjects, I guess the
[00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:43.380]   Bessah called them pro band. I'm not sure what the nomenclature is, but it's basically test
[00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:48.580]   subject five and test subject. Yes. Right. So test subject five. You want to go ahead
[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:53.780]   and if you could, you want to just share, like, you know, what was this individual and, and
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:57.460]   what did we, and what are we seeing when I, when I, and let me know when to flip the screen.
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:08.860]   Yep. So that's a 60 year old, um, that is, um, the suffering from a long carcinoma. And
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:15.940]   he had already been in, in treatment, right, to, you know, to work on it and to get better.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:22.660]   So he was tested. And so they took a blood sample and looked at the blood and it, yeah,
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:28.980]   I think you can now show what it looks like or looks like. So this is the before, right?
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:37.540]   So, yeah. So it looks, I mean, even for someone who's never seen dark field microscopy pictures
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:44.060]   after showing the next one, you will be able to easily tell and feel the difference. So
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:50.860]   this is pretty bad, right? There's this, this is really bad. You see, um, actually those
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:57.540]   money rolls all over the place and not even just single money rolls. It's just like stacks
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:03.700]   and stacks of money rolls all over the place. So it's, it's very unhealthy. It's, uh, you
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:08.500]   know, with the blood like this, it, you know, someone, a doctor would tell you immediately
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:13.660]   you're sick. You're, you're not doing well at all. We need to do something. There's lots
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:22.300]   of stuff going on with you. And, uh, for certain, not only that you're sick, but you're also
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:30.820]   at high risk, right? For anything, uh, hard, um, heart attack or stroke related, right?
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:36.540]   If the blood looks like that. So then go ahead. Yeah. I mean, this is, this is, this
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:42.660]   is not even the remote formation. These are just actual blood quats, clusterings. I mean,
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:46.700]   this is, this is, and then they're not even round. Uh, you know, the blood cells aren't
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:52.660]   even rounded. This is just very, very, very sickly. So yeah, that, this is wild. I, you
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.940]   know, so when I was looking at this earlier, I was like, wow, I've never seen anything
[00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:59.220]   like that. Uh, okay. So now this is the before. So the guy walks in off the street, they take
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:04.520]   a blood sample and this is what his blood looks like. And then so then the after picture
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:09.540]   is this is 15 minutes, right? So you put a Layla quantum jacket, he puts it on and then
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:13.900]   at 15 minutes later, they take a look at his blood. So what are we seeing here? Yeah.
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:24.580]   So it's a absolutely fast and phenomenal physical reaction into the quantum jacket,
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:33.980]   which shows now that you can see that those blood cells are, um, very much round and alone.
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:42.820]   You don't see these money rolls and stacks as before this is now way, way more healthy.
[00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:48.340]   It's, it's, it's absolutely significant. I mean, you can show this to anybody that knows
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:54.300]   something about dark field microscopy and they'll tell you this is an absolutely phenomenal
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:59.140]   improvement. So that was certainly great to see. And it was actually also great to see
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:07.380]   for this actual person. Um, because, you know, obviously, he's not very interested in getting
[00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:18.540]   the quantum jacket because he had no idea that this was possible, right? And certainly,
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:23.820]   so actually once you wear the jacket, still the effect still lasts for a while. It's not
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:30.260]   like, uh, it lasts forever, obviously, but every time you put it on, you get an additional
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:36.140]   boost. So yeah, I think this is pretty self-explanatory here to see the before and after.
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:39.740]   Yes. An amazing transformation of this. You can just see where, you know, there's been
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:44.500]   energy induced into the body and it's then, you know, unclustered the blood, increased
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:50.700]   oxygen flow. I mean, did the test subjects report feeling anything? Uh, you know, I
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:54.660]   mean, I can imagine where it's like you're suffocating and all of a sudden, you know,
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:57.940]   you can just like your blood can breathe kind of a thing, right? I mean, what do these people
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:03.580]   say? So we don't know, um, from all of them, what they said, just because that was not
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:08.700]   really part of the study, but this, this in specific here, this was reported to us so
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:16.100]   that the person definitely felt that, uh, very soon felt so much better and lighter and
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:23.520]   even more energetic. And that's something that I would guess a lot of people will actually
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:30.740]   notice that they will at least notice that they have more energy and they feel a little
[00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:36.500]   bit more powerful in a way, right? Just from a physical perspective. Yeah. I think one
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.940]   of the interesting things I noticed here is you see all this background garbage in the
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:44.900]   blood. It's like, like just waste, right? Uh, and all of a sudden when the blood gets
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:48.860]   opened up and it can flow, you can see a lot of that. It's just passed through now and
[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:53.380]   that it's, it's, it's the body's able to detox out all that, all that cellular rubbish,
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:57.940]   I guess. So it's really interesting how the space in between is darker. Okay. So let's
[00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:03.380]   talk about, uh, test subject number six, complete opposite level of health, right?
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:08.980]   Yes, because we wanted to look at different, different people for certain. So we had this
[00:46:08.980 --> 00:46:17.140]   very sick person. Now this is someone who's athletic and, uh, is, you know, relatively,
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:21.380]   lives a relatively conscious life. And we wanted to see, okay, so how does, how does
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:26.540]   that look? And obviously the, the blood to begin with looks more healthy than someone
[00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:33.620]   that is sick. It's just because you can see this stuff literally in the blood. So we can
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:40.420]   maybe pull this up and then. So this is a 60 year old healthy guy jogs all the time and he's
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:46.660]   walks in off the street and this is what his blood looks like. Exactly. And so obviously this
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:53.540]   looks way better than the other guy, uh, in the before picture, but then at the same time,
[00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:59.700]   there's still quite an improvement if we go to the next picture. Okay. And this is, uh,
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:07.380]   20 minutes after wearing the jacket. So he also has a response that basically unlocks all of these
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:14.500]   real low formations, opens it up and allows greater oxygen and blood flow from what I'm seeing, right?
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:22.500]   Yes, absolutely. So it, it, it works for everybody and it, um, basically helps everybody where they're
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:28.020]   at, uh, and then takes it from there. Yeah. Hey, you know, one thing I was, I'm sorry, this is, uh,
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:32.420]   this, this verbiage here on the slide is straight off the report. And I think it's
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:38.020]   something interesting that people should know is that Bessa made a comment in the report that
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:43.300]   said this guy walks in with his telephone. He had a smartphone that was plugged in. It was,
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:48.420]   uh, it was plugged in, uh, and it was sitting in his pocket. So this is a healthy person right
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:55.060]   here, a healthy person carrying around a cell phone. And you can see what EMF is doing because
[00:47:55.060 --> 00:48:00.740]   when you then take the, you know, like take the effect of EMF away by wearing a jacket,
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:05.780]   you could see how all of a sudden those roles go away. I think that's an important thing that
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.620]   it's interesting that they made a note here that the guy walked in with a cell phone at his pocket.
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:14.660]   But it's, it's, it's for mentioning that. It's like, yeah, because even a healthy person,
[00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:18.420]   if you're wearing a cell phone, you're still going to have some issues because of the cell
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:22.660]   phone as opposed to the other individual who was just really sickly to begin with. So yeah,
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:28.660]   it's an interesting observation. So, so, um, the next set of slides that I want to share with
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:34.100]   everybody is I want to make a point about EMF shielded clothing in general. Um, you know,
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:38.180]   there's, there are lots of companies out there, not a lot, but there's, you know, a good dozen or so
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:45.380]   are, are, are thereabouts that sell EMF shielded clothing. And they will measure the actual brute
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:51.060]   force shielding effort, like, you know, physical shielding, um, you know, between the source
[00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:55.620]   and the body, and they'll measure that and, and be able to determine what is the shielding
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:49:00.740]   effectiveness. And so that no matter what, if you buy shielded clothing, you will be, you know,
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:05.220]   like literally like a shield between you and the, and the stuff coming at you. And so, so there's
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:10.900]   that aspect of, of the product of the jacket. But what I think is so unique about the Leila
[00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:17.220]   Quantum jacket, the Leila, uh, EMF clothing is that it's infused with this Leila Q energy as
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:22.260]   Philip had discussed earlier. So what I want to do is just show you what the slides look like
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:27.380]   when somewhat when, because one of the things that Bessa had done in a prior test, and I pulled
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:35.060]   this out of the material from our other interview, Philip, was I want to show people that it's not
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:39.700]   just the shielded, it's not just wearing shielded clothing that makes a difference here,
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:44.180]   that it's that you're wearing shielded clothing that's been charged with quantum energy because
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:49.780]   when you take the shielded clothing away and you just look at this energy. And so this goes for
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:54.420]   your other products, right? This goes for your bracelets and your pendants. Uh, you may be even,
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.660]   you know, like maybe even like wearing a hat where it covers your whole body, but, but the whole idea
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:04.580]   though is this test here was done by Bessa prior to the jacket tests using the Q block right here,
[00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:09.860]   the quantum block. And so this is what I wanted to share. I pulled this out and this is a person,
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:15.620]   subject number three that walks in and they take and basically before, and I think the
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:21.140]   application of the Leila quantum block was you had the Bessa had them put their hands in it
[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:27.380]   for like five minutes was that was that the actual physical test? Yes, exactly. That happened
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:34.260]   after after this picture here, which by the way shows beautifully how bad the blood is with all
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:40.980]   those money rolls here. So this is probably, you know, so this is test subject number three off the
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:46.740]   street, you know, just like the rest of us subjected to all the EMF and whatever's going on in life,
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:52.020]   they walk in and you could just see this real formation of their blood. I mean, it's like
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:56.900]   perfect money rolls everywhere you look. It's a corn. This is their blood and look at, you could
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:02.740]   imagine that when you cluster up the blood cells like that, what the oxygen deprivation is,
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:08.100]   you probably reduce the oxygen flow because of the surface area. There's less surface area of
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:14.100]   each blood cell by at least 70%. So you've got a lot less oxygen going through the blood in this
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:19.700]   form. But what's really cool is just the energy itself. So, you know, so that's what makes this
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:26.260]   EMF clothing line so unique that if you just take away the actual silver shield and you wear a
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:33.220]   regular t-shirt, but if you also, but the energy itself has a huge effect because on this test
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:38.340]   subject here, they walk in, they've got this, this is their blood. And then what, is it, was it five
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:43.700]   minutes? I guess it was five minutes. Yes, it was just five minutes. Here you go. Test subject number
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:48.740]   three, dark field microscopy, five minutes, they stick their hands in the cube lock. Now look at
[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:55.940]   their blood. Boom. All of a sudden it's just all the cells are free, the blood's flowing, oxygen's
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:52:03.300]   improved. And I think that's such a profound test of just testing the, you know, just testing the
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:10.180]   energy itself and showing that the energy itself has a huge effect by itself. And then you've combined
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:14.420]   that with actual physical shielding to create one of the most unique products that are out there.
[00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:18.660]   So I wanted to really point this out because I know there's skeptics out there that say, well,
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:22.500]   you know, I could just get an EMF shielded from so and so and I got the same thing, but it's like,
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:26.740]   no, no, no, it's not the same thing. And that's, that's the point I wanted to make. Did you have
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:32.740]   anything you wanted to add? I think we've covered it. I think, yeah, and it's a good point to make
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:39.540]   because really just the blocking itself wouldn't, wouldn't do this. Right. So wrapping up on the
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:44.340]   idea of the test results, I just want to say that. So Bessa has now issued you a certificate of that
[00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:50.500]   they've tested your, your jacket. And then there's this, I was this IGF or EGF, right, is how you pronounce
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:56.740]   it is another Institute. So I just wanted to just touch on this guy, because what Bessa did was the
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:53:02.900]   dark field microscopy testing of the of the Laila jacket. And then so you had this other company.
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:10.820]   And another and another study. So they also ran a complete other study where they used the advanced
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:18.740]   decibel method. Okay. And went through actually testing EMF, but they also tested for environmental
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:30.180]   pollution, actually came out fantastic. And also looked at cytokines as an inflammatory factors,
[00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:40.260]   also perfect results there. And it also looked at additional stress factors, including oxidative
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:48.260]   stress, and what the jacket would do. And all those came back extremely positive. And then
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:57.220]   yes, indeed, there was the EGF certificate as well that we got for the actual blocking. That's what
[00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:04.660]   they tested in this case to actually see, you know, how is EMF really blocked from the jacket and to
[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:11.380]   what extent? And yeah, you're pulling it up here. So these are the shielding efficiencies here,
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:23.380]   which, you know, are pretty self-explanatory way above 99.9 or 99.99% for the various frequencies.
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:30.980]   And this is just a just one overview here. So, okay, so yeah, first, so for
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:39.700]   folks that need to understand, this is just to show that the actual material is shielding.
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:46.340]   And then the best certificate validates that, you know, what the effect of the body is on the body.
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:52.100]   So this is so, you know, it's just it's really just quite remarkable. I got to say that, you know,
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:57.780]   you're in you're in a space selling quantum products. And I do check out several others,
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:03.460]   but you're the you're the one company that just really just goes to the extent, I mean, just
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:07.860]   in testing and validating and third party results. And you know, it's very impressive. So I just
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:14.020]   want to say and share how much it, you know, testing has gone done and that has been done
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:18.660]   on these products. And I don't think people really truly understand that, you know, like how much
[00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:24.020]   testing goes in and that you validate everything that people are buying what you say they are by.
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:29.140]   So that's amazing. So, okay, so anything else you want to add on the testing? I just wanted to jump
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:34.260]   in. I think we've covered it. All right. So Philip, let me go ahead. What I want to do is I want
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:39.780]   to play the Kickstarter video and for everybody. And just and then we'll just do a wrap. So here
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:45.700]   you go. And magnetic fields are everywhere now. Protect and boost your energy with the Leela Quantum
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:51.220]   Jacket. The Leela Quantum Jacket is lined with high purity silver to help less than the harmful
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:57.060]   effects of exposure to EMF fields used for everything from cell phones to Wi-Fi and microwaves.
[00:55:57.060 --> 00:56:03.060]   EMF have been shown to decrease energy levels and well-being and even begin to plug in a new system.
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:08.340]   Leela Quantum Jacket leverages a proprietary technology that charges objects with quantum
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:13.860]   energy. Silver is an excellent container of quantum energy. The quantum energy in the Leela
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:19.380]   Quantum Jacket theory silver lining is PMS protective and it can activate the body's self-healing
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:24.820]   mechanisms. Also called zero-point energy or life force energy, this form of protective
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:29.860]   and balancing energy and vibration is built into the antimicrobial and odor-resistant Leela
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:35.460]   Quantum Jacket. Quantum energy can have a very positive impact on working and the immune system.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:39.940]   The boost energy and neutralized potentially harmful frequencies throughout the body,
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:45.220]   including BMF. It also does this for the parts of the body that are not directly protected by
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:50.580]   the jacket. Support our Kickstarter campaign and help protect and boost your positive energy
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:56.660]   with the Leela Quantum Jacket. That's very nicely done by the way. I got to give you some
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:59.380]   videos. That's really nice. This is way better than my videos.
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:07.140]   So to wrap up on the Kickstarter and we've talked about the Kickstarter, the product,
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:12.100]   the test results, EMF, but now it's so the Kickstarter, you've got some pretty cool offers
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:17.620]   right now. Do you want to kind of just share that and then we'll just do a wrap? What's the
[00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:25.620]   actual offer? Right now the jacket, there's still the early bird because we're basically just launching
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:36.900]   it. The early bird, there's free domestic shipping and then it's also $40 less expensive than the
[00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:46.500]   regular price. Order early, save $40. That's the Kickstarter and then supporting a pretty cool
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:51.700]   project out there to kind of deliver these products to the world. That's where it is. The
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:56.660]   link for the Kickstarter is going to be in the video description. I just want to encourage
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:58:03.460]   everybody to help support this great project and if you have any use for EMF protection,
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:10.180]   this is where to go. So thank you so much. So Philip, thank you again for spending some time
[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:14.740]   with me this morning and sharing this really cool project. I'm just really amazed. The test
[00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:19.220]   results are just amazing to me. I'm very much into the science of things and I'm just really
[00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:24.740]   amazed. So thank you so much. Now where do people reach you if they have questions? Because I do
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:30.260]   know that you take questions directly through your website. Like there's a contact page, right?
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:40.500]   Yeah, there's a contact page but also just info@lilaq.com would be an email address to use and then
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:45.780]   obviously we have this telegram group, the quantum power group. You'll probably put the
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:51.940]   link, the invite link to that in the video description for everybody that wants to join and
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:59:00.180]   there I can be found and people, they can send me private messages there too and that works very
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:05.460]   well. Okay, great. So if you've got any questions about the Kickstarter, any questions about the
[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:11.060]   product, you can contact Philip through the website or come over and there'll be links in the video
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:16.340]   description below on joining the quantum power group on telegram where it's all about the
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:21.540]   quantum energy quantum products, quantum tinkering. You can reach me here at the Tinkers Academy. I've
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:26.980]   got a whole page dedicated to this concept. Also a page on EMF itself at the Tinkers Academy and
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:33.140]   you just type in tinkers.academy in your URL window and you will then go right to my blog. So
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:37.540]   I just want to say thank you everyone and thank you Philip for your time this morning. Thank you
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:44.340]   for sharing this great project with us. It's just fascinating. So thank you. Yeah, so thank you so
[00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:52.660]   much. I really appreciate it. It was a great discussion and I really like how you also walked
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:59.860]   us through myself included through the EMF history and all that. So it's sometimes good to take
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:04.580]   some time to actually look at what has happened and where we are today and what we can do.
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:10.980]   Yeah, I agree. Thank you so much. I really appreciate your time and so everybody out there, thanks
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:15.700]   for your time. Thanks for stopping by and thanks for your support for the Layla Quantum Tech jacket.
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:17.860]   Aloha. Thank you all.
