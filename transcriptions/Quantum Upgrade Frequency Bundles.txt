[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   Aloha and welcome to another video by me, Kay Elmer. And on this video, I've got Philip on the line
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.480]   and we are going to be talking about quantum upgrade, the frequency bundles, the long-awaited
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.040]   addition of frequencies to the quantum upgrade. I've got tons of questions. It's going to be
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:24.240]   launching today. Today is December 16th, 2022. It's Friday. Philip, good morning. How are you doing
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.680]   today? Hi, Kay. I'm doing fine. I'm doing better. I got really sick last week. But
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.440]   I feel so much better now. That's good. Yeah, that's great. And a lot of folks are sick right
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.920]   now. It's really weird. Oh, it's winter, you know. Typical winter. Okay. So, Philip, if you don't
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.120]   know, he's the owner, owner, operator, founder, and, and the healer himself for Layla Quantum
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.120]   Tech and Layla Upgrade or the upgrade, Quantum Upgrade, and also Layla Labs. So, I pretty much
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.840]   had him on 100 videos at this point. But Philip's going to be joining me and we're going to talk
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.480]   about this feature called the frequency bundles. And we've mentioned that in the last video,
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.040]   really happy to be sharing that. It launched us today. So, before what we jump in, I just want
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.000]   to do a disclaimer in case we say anything that, you know, we need to make sure we put a disclaimer
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.600]   on. So, here we go. Here we go. We'll just get through this real quick and then jump right into
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.120]   the content. So, neither Quantum Upgrade nor the Tinkers Academy recommend or endorse any specific

[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.080]   So, let's jump right in. Okay. So, really, really cool. The website is up and running. I'm
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.960]   going to walk you through the pages. Philip's going to explain everything. I have just learned about
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.320]   this like on Monday in terms of it, you know, coming out today and I have absolutely no idea
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.240]   how it works. So, we're going to learn together, everybody. And Philip's going to guide us. But,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.040]   overall, I'm just going to do a high-level overview, okay, Philip? They're going to launch today,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:16.080]   right? And you've got two bundles, right? And so, that's how you add frequencies to your existing
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.960]   subscription will be to sign up for a bundle. And there's one bundle called the abundance bundle.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.560]   And it's got the abundance frequency, the prosperity frequency, gratitude, and agni-power.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.440]   And then there's another bundle called the heel bundle, which has the heel frequency,
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.760]   and then inner piece weight management and the nutritional bio-base. So, I guess, you know,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.240]   just because I just, I'm just seeing this for the first time too, myself, everybody, you know,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.760]   and so I'm guessing that you guys went with one bundle for, you know, to, you know, to kind of,
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.280]   you know, like life-changing, life-supporting, and another one for health, you know, for health,
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.800]   right? That's kind of what your thinking was. Is that about it? Yes, that's correct. One
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.400]   correction though, the heel frequency is indeed that that is the frequency that is also in the
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:15.200]   heel cavity. So, it's a fully complete heel frequency, in that sense. Trichrobiobase is separated
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.560]   out just because we've had some athletes that actually wanted this to be separated. We have
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.120]   several professional athletes that use the quantum upgrade, and they like to use both the heel and
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:35.280]   the nutritional bio-base, but the nutritional bio-base is what they tend to use during an actual performance
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.160]   or competition for whichever reason, and then the heel, which contains the nutritional bio-base,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.960]   rather beforehand and after for recovery. So, we just decided we'll just do that, and then people
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.320]   can just pick and choose however they like it. And by the way, people stayed tuned because we're not
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.960]   only just going through the frequency bundles and some specific questions that you asked in the
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:07.040]   telegram group, we are also talking about a couple other new things that will happen that
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.880]   includes a free product and things like that. So, just bear with us here, we'll get to all of that.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:21.440]   Okay, no, cool. Okay, so right now there's two, and then right before we started the recording
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.800]   for this video, we just kind of worked out that there'll be a third one, which will be the various
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.440]   boosters that I've created, so they'll be like a, I guess, a booster bundle coming out, I guess,
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.920]   in the near future, right? So, they're going to be a third one and then more as we go along. So,
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.000]   this isn't the only frequencies that will ever be offered, right, Philip? Yes, that is correct.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.360]   We'll have more in this booster bundle, which will contain the man's booster, women's booster,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:05:02.240]   the seasonal booster, former allergy relief and then the inflammation relief booster or inflammatory
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.040]   booster, I don't even know what the current description is. We will launch that probably in,
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.840]   I would say in the second half of January is a fair bet that that should be live, so, yeah,
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.440]   that will be coming. And then we'll see if we do more afterwards.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.080]   Okay, awesome. So, let's talk about it then, because there's tons of questions about,
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.800]   you know, that I have, like, how does it work? How do I sign up? How do I pick a juice?
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.320]   So, here we go. So, this is the, so this is live right now, right, on the website?
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.080]   Correct. Okay. Yes, it is live. And so, here we go. You got the Quantum Energy bundles. You've got,
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.800]   you go to the bundle selection. So, in, you know, in the website, you would just go to shop,
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.160]   click on bundles, and then you get the bundles. You get to pick three, four, five all in one bundle,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.520]   but now you've got these two other bundles that you can choose from. So, Philip, right,
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.560]   the first thing that has to happen though is you have to have a subscription for yourself,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.800]   as you as the person, right, in order to add these, because these are add-ons, correct?
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.480]   For anyone, you just have to have any subscription. It does not matter whether you have a bundle,
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.320]   if you have the field for you, field for home, it does not matter if you have multiple.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:24.320]   And frankly, that's one of the unique things here. Let's say if you have a pick five bundle,
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.600]   and you get this abundance frequency bundle, then that will be available for all of your services.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.360]   So, you don't have to purchase the abundance bundle for each of your individual services,
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:45.200]   which would be five if you have a pick five. No, it would be added to all of those right away.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:51.040]   Oh, okay. Oh, great. Okay. So, as long as I have a subscription of any kind,
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.240]   I can add on frequencies, right? Yes.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.400]   Okay. All right. So, when you click on, let's say, the abundance bundle,
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.000]   then this is what you've got. Okay. So, again, my first thing here, I'm going to just
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.080]   ask this question here. I know that bundles don't have seven day free trials. So, will the frequency
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.280]   have a free trial? No, I think there. Okay. So, it's a bundle, right? So, bundles don't have free
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.120]   trials. But if you already have a subscription, then you go ahead, this is how you sign up.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.240]   One of the things about this is that this is just purely the selection for how you want to
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.040]   subscribe. So, it describes the different frequencies, and it gives you a description of the bundle.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.960]   Is there anything you want to say about this particular bundle? Like,
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.680]   could you kind of describe what it would be? Yes. If somebody were to decide,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.360]   do I want to heal one or do I want the abundance one? I mean, how would you describe which one to
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:51.840]   choose? Well, I always recommend to people to ask their heart. That's always the first thing to do.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.280]   As background information really, one is more focused on health and wellness,
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:05.680]   which is the heal bundle. And then the abundance is really to fill these inner gaps and deficits
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:13.600]   that we have. So, it's all about really inner abundance to fill ourselves up with our original
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   energy into not needing to fill these deficits with something. As an example, I need to be loved
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.800]   by someone to feel good. I need to eat chocolate to feel good. I need to have more money to feel
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:34.960]   good. I need to have a yellow car in order to feel good. All these things, they come from
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:41.680]   inner deficits does not mean at all that we can't have a yellow car, that we can't have a lot of
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:48.320]   money, that we can't have chocolate, that we can't be loved by someone. All of that we can have,
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:56.960]   but it's a big difference if that happens out of need, right? We're very needy and we need that
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:04.960]   in order to feel good or to feel worthy. Or if we feel worthy to begin with and we feel full
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.560]   and we don't need it, but then we have it or create it. That's two completely different
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:19.120]   states and everything in this abundance bundle actually helps with getting to that state,
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.120]   which is a process. It's nothing. You don't turn this on and then suddenly your whole life is fully
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:32.880]   abundant. It cannot work that way. It's something that develops over time and it signals to our whole
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:41.360]   system that that's what happens, but you may indeed feel more full, more nourished pretty much right
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.880]   away as you turn on the abundance frequency as an example, right? They do have short-term effects,
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:55.120]   but the issues are usually pretty deep and it takes time to transform those. I hope that
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:01.120]   explanation helps a little. Yeah, no, it really does. I think it really helps understand what the
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:07.280]   purpose of it is and I think your point about having time. This is frequency
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:14.160]   healing, quantum healing, and I think if people were to study the concept of the human bio field
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:24.240]   and understand how frequencies work within that bio field and how issues, traumas, motions all
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:30.640]   get trapped in that bio field and how different frequencies will affect those other frequencies.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.840]   And it's all about entrainment. So you hear you've got this loving,
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:41.600]   positive self-loving, very positive frequency set and it's going to take a while for it to
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   entrain with all of the different things within you that are holding you back. All of those emotions
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.160]   and experiences have all been trapped within your bio field as frequencies. And so you've got this
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:57.520]   set of frequencies that are within your field, then you've got this loving, self-loving frequency
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.600]   set. And it takes a while for those two things to entrain, but when they eventually do,
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.680]   it's a beautiful thing. So yeah, no, that's a very good point. I always forget to explain that
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:15.040]   to people about how frequencies work. Okay, so that's great. Okay, one thing to add and that was
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.360]   amazing. Thanks for the explanation, by the way. I think everyone appreciates that.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.240]   In this abundance bundle, there's a new frequency in there that even
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:32.560]   hasn't been or was it released on Lita Quantum Tech yet? It's the gratitude frequency. So that is
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:39.680]   really a completely newly developed one that we developed together with Roman. And it's obviously
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.840]   great timing for Christmas, right? Because Christmas can really be about gratitude and remembering
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:53.200]   what it is that we're grateful for. And if we are grateful, if we can get into the state of
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:12:00.400]   gratitude, that actually changes our vibration in a very, very positive way. And it allows
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:06.000]   for a lot of great things to happen in our lives. We tend to forget, right? There's always
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.600]   something that we feel like we need or like we're frustrated because we didn't get it or there's
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.560]   jealousy because someone else got something that we didn't get and all these things. But if we
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:22.400]   remind ourselves of, okay, what are the three, four, five things that we're grateful for? Suddenly,
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:30.560]   we notice that our own vibration changes. And so this gratitude frequency really helps with that.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:36.320]   It's actually pretty amazing. And yeah, so for anyone that gets this bundle,
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:43.200]   you know, maybe see if it makes sense for you around Christmas to turn on that
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.600]   gratitude frequency and see what it does. Oh, yeah, that's wonderful. Okay, yeah,
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.920]   I didn't notice that. That's a new one. Cool. That's very cool. Absolutely. I have learned
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:01.840]   throughout my years that you are 100% correct that, you know, whenever I really, really wanted
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.920]   something to happen, if I wanted it for someone else. And I appreciated what I already had. And
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.080]   there was no, you know, envy, jealousy, all that stuff that just kind of brings you down that,
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:17.120]   you know, beautiful things happen. So yeah, that's awesome. Okay, so I'm loving this bundle
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.600]   already. I'm going to sign up for this one. So let's walk through signing up for one. But before
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.480]   we get into that, so that's the description of the abundance bundle. Let's talk about, you know,
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.240]   so what did you have in mind, like if somebody were just, you know, like, why would someone want
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.760]   to heal bundle? Like, what would it do for them in terms of like the overall bundle?
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.120]   How would you describe this to someone that says, well, you know, what's the heal bundle
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:44.160]   if they didn't know anything about it? Yep. So again, I think it's all around health and wellness,
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:51.600]   you know, mentally, energetically, physically, where, you know, the heal is obviously the one that
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:14:00.400]   activates the inner healer. And it contains these wonderful molecular frequencies as well.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:09.280]   The inner piece is one that if you, if you have trouble sleeping, that's actually the one that I
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:16.080]   always recommend at first, because it helps to balance the mind. And it just helps us be more
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:24.160]   at ease with with everything and to relax more into what's happening and what is. So and that is
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   that what I found at least for most people, a big reason why we can't sleep that well,
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:36.400]   if we cannot sleep well. And so that's the go to even though it doesn't make you sleepy, it really
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:42.080]   does not make you sleepy. And that's it was developed actually for for the day to use to be used throughout
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:49.280]   the day. And a lot of people use it for that. It helps with relaxing also into situations where
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.680]   we may feel stressed or anxiety. And I always give this example of the kid that has a math test
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:02.160]   in school. And that kid is actually pretty good at math and knew everything when the kid learned.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:10.960]   Now in the test situation, it's just overwhelmed with that stress and can't access that information
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:16.320]   just doesn't know anything. And it's maybe the first two questions that the kid doesn't know,
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:22.160]   and then it gets even worse, right? And then it forgets everything. And so with this inner
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:29.520]   piece frequency, what that does is it helps us to access our inner piece inside, which is
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:36.880]   never gone. It's always there, but it can be blocked. And it helps to access that and to
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:44.960]   instimulate ourselves actually to expand that. And then we can suddenly relax into that information
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:51.280]   can flow in freely again. We don't need to be in such a panic mode. And so that's pretty much
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.400]   what that does. So it has a lot of use cases throughout the day and also throughout the night.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:03.360]   The weight loss actually should be called weight management here. And weight management,
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:10.880]   there's not much to say about it, right? It helps with the metabolism. It helps reduce
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:18.560]   the craving. And it supports someone if you really set an intention to lose weight. So it does not
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.040]   work without that. So really, I mean, it helps a little bit with the craving and the metabolism.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:30.160]   But if you don't set your intention for yourself, it's not going to work on its own, right? You
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.200]   can't just keep doing what you're doing and then have that card and think, well, yeah,
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.240]   that's going to fix it. That's not how that works. And this frequency, if you turn it on,
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.720]   you want to have an intention. The nutritional biobase, I think we talked about that, that's
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:51.200]   basically a subset of the heel of frequency, but it's just focused on these molecular frequencies
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.440]   of the most important vitamins and minerals. Okay. All right. So yeah, that's kind of
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.480]   the way, you know, if there's so many positive benefits, it's going to be, can people sign up
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.280]   for both if they wanted? Because you know, I can see there's a huge argument for, yeah, I want both.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.560]   Okay. All right. So you can sign up for both. And so let's walk through how the sign up process
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:18.400]   with a couple of things we want to point out is that in terms of like you have this note here,
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.120]   it says a frequency bundle can only be added by an existing subscriber, but contains because it
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:28.480]   contains add on features for the actual quantum upgrade service. So as we said earlier, all you
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.360]   have to do is just have a subscription for anything. And then, but the thing is, is right, Philip is
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:40.240]   like, but me as a subscriber, I have actually signed up to other people, right, daughter,
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.240]   future brother in law, or future son-in-law, quite question mark. And, and they have their own
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.280]   subs, they have their own access to their settings now right through the sharing feature. So if they,
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.960]   if they wanted to add on frequencies, but it's my subscription, they can't, right? It's only,
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.560]   I'm the only one that can do it. Is that correct?
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:07.120]   So you would be the one that signs up, okay, to add the, let's say the abundance bundle.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:13.840]   And once you sign up, then it will be available for you and for them as well.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.240]   Oh, okay. And they can pick and choose. Yeah, it will be unlocked for, for anyone. That's what I try
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:24.400]   to explain initially that literally if you have a pick five bundle, pick three bundle, pick four bundle,
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.960]   all in one bundle, whatever it may be, you get these frequencies unlocked for any of your services.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.040]   Oh, great. Okay. So that's automatically for them as well. Okay, because I got the pick, yes,
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:41.040]   I bundle with dogs and family and okay. All right. So then, then I can then share it with them because
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:46.160]   it's my subscription. Got it. Okay. So that's really cool. Okay. So that's that disclaimer there.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.560]   Now, if you just, if anyone's interested, you can kind of get a little bit of the description
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:56.000]   here down on the bottom of the page, but pretty much this is the abundance bundle sign up page,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.080]   and this is the heel bundle. So then the pricing now for the subscription is either monthly or yearly,
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:08.400]   right? So right now, I guess, could you, I guess it's what, what's the pricing? It's like $10 a month
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:15.200]   and it's $100 a year. Correct? Yes. So do the 10 for a month or 100 a year, so you save $20
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.920]   or 20%. Okay. So then if I want this, then I would go ahead again, just just to add really
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:27.600]   for absolute clarification, this is not per person or per service. So if you have just one field
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.120]   for you, yeah, that's the price, then it's 10 bucks per month. But if you have a pick five,
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.320]   then it's also 10 bucks per month. But for the whole bundle, which basically makes it
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:47.040]   two bucks per service of your five that that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. So yeah.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:52.000]   So it's for anybody that it's in your bundle or okay. Perfect. All right. So then that's,
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.760]   that's how you basically sign up. So then you would then once you add it to your cart, you know,
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.680]   you want to add the bundle and I could literally add the other bundle as well, then you go ahead
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.760]   and click on your cart and you check out. So all of you have signed up before, you know what that
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.680]   checkout process is. It's got all my personal information. So I'm going to edit that out and
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.040]   then we'll jump right into the settings page to show you what it looks like. So we're going to go
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:16.560]   ahead and check out right now my page, right? This would be my quantum upgrade page for me.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.360]   And so then where you find the frequency section is right down here in this section right here
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:26.960]   called special frequency. So Philip, can you kind of walk us through what the settings are and
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:32.960]   how to use them? Yes. Give me one second. So
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:45.600]   click on special frequency real quick. Okay. And now go to frequency day. Okay.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:51.600]   That's where you can select now any of the frequencies that are part of the bundle
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:58.160]   for your daytime and your nighttime. And you can certainly also just select none if at night,
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:04.960]   for example, you don't want one. That's pretty much how it works. And you can go in at any time,
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:10.160]   of course, and then select it back from, let's say you pick the abundance for during the day
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:15.920]   and then at 4 p.m., you think, okay, I actually want to switch it to gratitude or I want to have none,
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:21.040]   then you just go in and select that again and then click on update.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:28.160]   Okay. So let's say if actually I just turned it on. So this is live. I want to add that,
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.600]   let's talk about that, you know, because gratitude. And so I would just click I want
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:36.240]   gratitude during the day and at nothing. And then at night, I don't want anything turned on.
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:43.120]   Then I would just go ahead and click update. And then there we go. And then I can see myself
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.040]   right here. I've got the gratitude turned on. There we go. And that's how you turn it on.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.920]   Anything else we need to know? No, that's really it. You know, you're completely flexible and
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:57.600]   turning it on and off at any time. And yeah, that's pretty much how it works.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.560]   But the dog it doesn't show up, right? Oh, it does.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:07.040]   It should actually. Yeah. So now it's it's not necessarily the frequencies for the dog, but you
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:13.520]   know, at some point, we will probably have frequencies also for the dog. We probably
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:19.040]   will have a pet bundle at some point, right? And then it would come in handy.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:24.800]   Oh, okay. All right. And then okay, so then you could pretty much provide frequencies or any
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.640]   of these frequencies apply to pets, except for a neutral nutritional biobase I saw earlier.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.720]   There's a little disclaimer that said it's not good for pets or it's not it's not specific
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:40.480]   towards pets. It's specific to human physiology as a poor pet. So everything except nutritional
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:44.560]   biobase, probably, right? And that would include the heel pad and the heel frequency set because
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.120]   it includes it. But any of these others could apply to a pet, right? If you wanted to.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.080]   I think I think my dog needs to show a little bit more gratitude. I'll turn it on and see what
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:23:05.440]   happens. Okay. Yeah, that's what happens with Norman. Okay, great. So so that's it. I'm going to
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:10.480]   kind of like take a look at my question. So it's for so my I had my laser, my cheat notes, but
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.440]   only for you know, it's for all. So let me just it's for all for all subscriptions, right?
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.640]   How to add it. We just walked you through it. The usage guidelines, it's like, you know,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:26.480]   night and day, how we picked it, how we picked and choose which one. So it's so I guess the key
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.560]   thing there though, looking at the page was that you're not when you turn it on, you're not turning
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:36.000]   on four to time, you're turning on one at a time, right? So that's that's correct. Okay. All right.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.040]   And then the pricing we talked about. So those are those questions. Yeah, this is really cool. So
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.520]   right now you've got the two main bundles that's in that we walked you through how to sign up for
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:51.440]   it and the pricing and how to set the settings. It's live as of today. And now we did have some
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:56.560]   questions in the telegram chapter. So let's talk about that. Just to make sure we covered all the
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:01.440]   questions, right? So here's one of the one of the questions that popped up, which was when the
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.800]   frequencies go live, how do we best go about using them? And I think we talked about that. So but
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.200]   here's the specific questions. I think I'll focus on inner piece to begin with, but would like to
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:17.280]   add abundance as well, which is totally possible. If you you'd have to go with the two different
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.960]   ones, because those inner pieces, it's over in heel and abundance, it's over in abundance.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:27.200]   But then here we go. So I'd like to use inner piece for like seven days in a row, right? Or how
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.360]   much is it recommended for in training the system to this frequency? Good question.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:38.080]   Yeah, I mean, per frequency, if you want to get the benefit from it.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:45.520]   Yep. So, you know, this user will probably by now know that we have these two bundles and that each
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:52.560]   bundle contains four different frequencies. And then, you know, to the second part of the questions,
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:25:00.080]   use it for seven days. I always suggest to tune in and check in every day, really,
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:07.200]   how it is for you. That's that's a good training and practice for ourselves to hear more really,
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:14.000]   what does our inner voice say or gut feeling, if you will? And it cannot be generalized. Like,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.040]   I couldn't tell you, yeah, seven days is great or one day is great. It's for each one, it may be
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:27.040]   different. And you can just say, you know, you'll have it for a whole week. And then if you feel at
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:33.200]   day five, you want to turn it off or switch it up, then you go do that. So I would try to not be
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:42.160]   static about these things, but rather dynamic and flexible. And how long does it take to actually
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:47.760]   have an effect right away? It has an effect right away. Each of these frequencies have an effect
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:57.760]   right away. But obviously, if we have stronger states of anxiety, for example, that we've also
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:05.280]   had for a long period of time, it may take a long time for us to really be in this inner peace
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:13.120]   on a more regular basis without a frequency. And it's really impossible to say for some people,
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:18.960]   it may take a few days for some people, it may take a few weeks for other people, it may take
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:26.080]   many months of working with these frequencies until they can really recreate this on their own
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:33.600]   in very stressful situations. So that's an impossible advice to give, to say exactly
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:39.200]   how you need to do it. It's just something you play around with. It's something you feel, okay,
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:45.360]   inner peace, that feels good for me today. That's what I'm going to go with. You know, that's what
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:50.640]   I would do. Yeah, I think if I could share my experience as well, I mean, several years ago,
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:56.480]   you know, I made myself a capsule of every frequency. And I'd have them all hanging
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.640]   on a wall, like 10 or 12 different capsules, different frequencies. The same concept here,
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.240]   you've got multiple frequencies, which one do you wear today? It's like, which, you know,
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:09.200]   like which tie do I wear to work kind of thing. And what worked, what happened with me was,
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.800]   it just was what I didn't even think about it anymore. It was like, okay, how do you know,
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.520]   it's like, I just would reach out intuitively to which one I wanted to resonate with.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:27.040]   And to me, I kind of really always resonated to heal when I had something that needed healing.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:32.480]   And then when it wasn't, when I had like an emotional situation, I went with inner peace.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.480]   And then sometimes it was like, I remember wearing the heel capsule once for four months,
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.960]   straight, just trying to get through something. And it wasn't until I intuitive felt that,
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:46.160]   okay, I'm good now, that I switched to a different frequency. So I would say you really want to
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:52.560]   listen to your intuition and try when you'd want to choose, don't think.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:59.040]   I would say quiet your mind, don't be talking, turn off the head, right? And then just make a
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:04.160]   choice with your heart. And I think that's going to help you decide what your body wants. Because,
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.680]   you know, your higher self will always tell you. I mean, would you agree with that?
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:16.720]   Absolutely. And then some people obviously have a harder time with that. And then if you're not
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:22.320]   sure, just go with whatever is the dominant impulse. And then whatever you get, at some point,
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:27.040]   you will get another impulse that tells you to turn it down and just follow that, you know,
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:33.440]   just just be very easy with that. So, you know, you really can't do it wrong, you know.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.680]   Right. In fact, yeah, like your comment about weight management, you know, you have to set the
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:42.640]   intention. You can't, you know, you can't like eat what eat all the stuff you regularly eat,
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.520]   and then and then have a frequency and expect anything changes. So you really have to set the
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.000]   intention, you have to work towards that. So that could also be another way to do it. So if you
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.080]   wanted to say, look, I want to, I want to embrace inner peace, or and I want to focus and I want
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.760]   to meditate. And I'm going to turn this thing on because I'm going to do this certain thing.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:04.080]   And I'm going to focus on it. Right. So that could be your objective. And if you wanted to then
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.800]   work on weight management, then turn that on, and then go for whatever period of time. So it's
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:14.000]   really going to be up to you and how you feel about it. Okay. All right. Anything else about that?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.640]   We're good. No, I think we're good regarding that. Yeah. Really. Yeah. Because that seems that
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:24.800]   question comes up all the time, you know, and it's true. It's like, how do I know how long that,
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   you know, it takes for something to work. And my answer is always like, go with, you know,
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.120]   go with your intuition. But yeah, I think I mean, which we'll keep trying to explain that
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:38.320]   and help people. Yes. And by the way, I mean, people pay thousands and thousands of dollars,
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:44.400]   actually, to go through courses where they learn how to get more access to their
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:51.120]   inner knowing, to their inner power and all of that. And so in this case here, you can,
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:56.640]   you don't need to do that. You can just practice that on your own. Just make it a daily,
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.440]   daily habit, daily practice in the morning. Just check in. Okay. So what do I feel like right now?
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:08.240]   Which is the one I want to set? You go for that. And it will just, as you keep doing that, you will
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:15.440]   just open up more and more and it will be very beneficial for your relationship with yourself.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.920]   Yeah. Absolutely. No, no, that's great. That's great advice. Okay. So second question was,
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:25.120]   okay, when and when I afterwards want to use the abundance figure, so this person would say,
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.360]   I'm going to use heel or inner piece for seven days or inner piece for a period of time,
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:34.000]   but then they want to switch to abundance, right? Should I then use that exclusively,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.040]   right? I think we answered that or should I use inner piece and the day and abundance at night?
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.520]   Oh, that's a good twist. So that second piece of the question here is if I'm switching over from
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:50.720]   one frequency to another, is it recommended or what would you say, Philip, if I used both
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.960]   one during the day and then one at night? What would you think?
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:03.040]   Well, I mean, so you can't use two frequencies at the same time that's impossible to set in the
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:08.240]   system for a reason. And you can absolutely set one for the day and one for the night. And the same
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:16.960]   principle applies, just feel what feels better to you. Usually, most people would probably choose
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:25.360]   the inner piece for the night, but hey, if the inner abundance topic is when you're working with
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.400]   currently, it can also be an absolutely great frequency at night because it may
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:36.160]   actually helps you to get some dreams in that regard. And maybe some things come into your
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:44.240]   consciousness through dreams because of that frequencies that help you further to maybe recognize
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:52.480]   patterns that are in the way of the inner abundance you're trying to achieve.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.320]   So yeah, it's absolutely possible to also use those at night.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:01.120]   Okay, so it's either day or night one at a time, right? Okay. And yeah, you could do them both,
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:05.760]   and that's a good, good question. Thank you for asking that. Okay, so the next question here is,
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:12.160]   should we routinely cycle in the frequencies we would like to keep in train two? Or will the
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:18.480]   effect of inner piece last if we use it for a week in a row to begin with? Another really great
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:26.880]   question. So that's a great question, but again, an impossible answer, because I have to refer again
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:34.320]   to that everyone is very individual. Like if you're someone that has had terrible anxiety for the
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:41.520]   last five years, you're going to be working with this for way longer and much more intensively
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:47.280]   that someone that just recently started to get some anxiety because of a specific situation.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:53.840]   So it's really impossible to say for me, and it's just something you need to feel,
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:33:02.240]   and you need to do that work that maybe you've used the inner piece for a while,
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:09.280]   and then you don't use it on a specific day and just see if you're still a little bit in that mode
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:16.240]   of the inner piece and things throw you out of balance as easily as they did before.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:22.560]   So that's just something where you can observe, sort of really work, right? It can be actually
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:28.080]   fun to observe that a little more, and then you will get a sense of that and for that.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:35.120]   Okay, no, that's great. Yeah, in fact, in biofield tuning again, when you actually
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   entrain away a negative emotion frequency, that frequency is gone. So it does last in that regard.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:50.640]   But yeah, I guess it's really hard to say per person, but personally for me,
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.800]   because I've been doing this the longest, probably I'm like one of the first customers ever,
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:03.040]   I would say that I have learned that like, let's say I went through kind of a negative
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:11.760]   emotional thing, lost a family dog, how it is, and I carried the inner piece for six months or
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:19.600]   something, until it kind of was like, I could live without it. I got over it. And that piece
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:26.160]   lasts all to this day, three years ago. So I would say that it does kind of help. And it
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:32.640]   all really depends on the situation, on you, on what frequency. But yeah, I think it really does
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:38.400]   carry with you, because you entrain to it. It becomes part of who you are. And if you need
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:44.080]   another boost of it, by all means, right, Phillip? You know, because it's life, you know, we're all
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:48.400]   living, we're changing, we're evolving. So you might need another boost of inner piece, you know,
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:54.880]   and then the following year. But yeah, definitely, I think it lasts for my own experiences. Okay.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:00.400]   Yes, that's absolutely correct. That's great that you say that. And then we have this onion
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:06.480]   principle, right? That's that it plays anyway. Everyone that's someone on the path to,
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:13.040]   to him, herself, really, to access the inner power to unlock more of our consciousness,
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:20.480]   we have these layers that are, you know, like the layers of an onion with blockages with topics
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:30.000]   and stuff like that. And then once we peel one layer off, it feels a lot better and easier and
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.320]   lighter and all of that. But then, you know, that's also life. We at some point arrive at the next
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:42.240]   layer of that, right? And so that may be another layer related to inner piece in this one specific
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:48.400]   example, but with different topics and maybe with even different depth. And then you really,
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:54.000]   when that shows up, then you may need it again for quite some time to work through whatever's showing
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.080]   up. And then once that's released, it will be more free again. And you may not need the inner
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:04.880]   piece for quite some time. And then, oh, after half a year, again, something is showing up, right?
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:10.000]   And it's bubbling up from the inside that that may be the next layer of the onion. That's kind of
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   what I've found or allows you decades, um, happens with things until you're really free in regards to
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:26.080]   one specific aspect. Yeah, no, I agree. That makes a lot of sense. Okay, good. Great question. Thank
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:32.000]   you, uh, from for that out there in telegram world. Okay, so we got four more questions
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.680]   that we picked out of the out of the chat group. So here we go. Should the should we use the
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:44.560]   frequency for the house if someone in the house is using a specific frequency card? So my husband
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:49.760]   is using the focus card right now. So would it be too much to also turn on a different frequency in
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:58.000]   the home? That's a really good question. Um, specifically with this focus card, I think you're
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.920]   actually fine with turning on another frequency, especially the frequencies that we currently offer
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:13.920]   in these two bundles. I don't really see any, um, any interference with that. So, so you would be,
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:23.680]   you would be fine. And, um, his system would also be able to, to distinguish. So I'm, I would
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:32.080]   definitely say it's, it's okay to do. Um, what I would, you know, not necessarily do is to use any
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:40.640]   specific frequencies at nights that, you know, someone in the house may be just a very light
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:48.400]   sleeper and then that may be too stimulating. So the biobase frequency, possibly the heal frequency,
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:55.840]   the heal frequency may actually really work well with, uh, with a level of 500, for example, level
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:01.760]   600. Um, but it needs to be tested. You know, you would just need to be aware if there's
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:08.480]   someone a very light sleeper. Um, but, uh, but again, as long as you keep the quantum upgrade
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.480]   unrelatively low during the night, you should also be okay with that.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:18.800]   Okay. Uh, you know, that's, it's actually a really great question. So I got to tail on
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:24.480]   questions. Uh, the first one would be, let's say in this specific example of someone using the
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:30.800]   focus card, right? Uh, is there a complimentary, uh, frequency with, within the bundle that might
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:36.000]   actually help and, and, you know, make that process even better for that individual? If we were
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.840]   to take a look at either one of the bundles, would there be something that would actually,
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:49.920]   um, you know, be complimentary? Well, I, three come to mind. Uh, one would be the, the inner piece,
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:56.640]   one would be the gratitude and one would be the abundance. Those are all frequencies that are, um,
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:04.960]   that the other would maybe offer a greater space of, of, of a very positive and supportive
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.960]   frequency in general, in order to also work with the focus frequency.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:14.480]   Okay. Great. Okay. Uh, and then the other question I had related to this is, uh, you know,
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:22.960]   for someone like myself, um, I've got several blocks, uh, in my home capsules. Um,
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:28.400]   everything's kind of in use in one way or another. Um, and then of course I've got the upgrade as
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.760]   well. Uh, because then, you know, when I leave my home and I'm away from all of this stuff, I,
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:40.480]   you know, I want the quantum energy still, right? Um, is there any, like, is there anything anyone
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:44.320]   should know about? You know, in terms of like, yeah, I've got, you know, I've got an infinity
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:49.680]   block in my house and if I turn on, and I wear the heel capsule, but then I turn on the quantum
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:56.160]   upgrade and I turn on a frequency because, you know, I know that in the chat, uh, most recently,
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:02.160]   there was this, you know, this discussion about swapping the lids right on capsules. And then
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:07.040]   the response was just like it's not recommended that you, you do the booster at the same time,
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:11.920]   you do the heel because there's just way too many frequencies, you know, in those two sets, right?
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:20.640]   So for someone who owns stuff, owns Layla products, um, would setting, you know, turning on a
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:25.360]   frequency, uh, like this individual here, they have a focus, they have a device in their house,
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:30.000]   they have a frequency card in their house and then sending them frequencies via quantum upgrade.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.840]   Is there any kind of like, you know, suggestion or guideline do you have for that?
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:43.120]   Well, so the general guideline is always to try to focus on one frequency set at a time
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:50.480]   and that remains my general guideline, but there are absolute exceptions to the right. We just
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:58.240]   talked about this focus that it would be possible, um, to combine it and also in specific situations
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:05.120]   for specific people, it may be the right way to go. And frankly, like there's a couple frequencies
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:09.920]   like the abundance and the prosperity frequency, for example, those two go very well together
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:18.320]   at pretty much all times. So it's, it's a little bit hard to say in general, try to focus on one,
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:24.080]   but then if you're not sure, just feel or then just try it out, go try it out. You know, it's not going
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:32.080]   to do anything bad. It just may feel a little, if you feel a little overwhelmed then or it, you know,
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:41.520]   you feel confused or you just don't feel that good and supported, then you probably know, okay, well,
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:49.440]   I should stick with just one of those, right? But hey, you will probably feel it and if it feels good,
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:55.920]   go for it. Yeah, okay. Well, good. Yeah, that aligns with how I responded about the swapping
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:01.600]   listening. So yeah, okay, great. So yeah, go with how it feels. And if it doesn't feel positive for
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:07.440]   you, then go just to one at a time. Okay. All right. So number two, how would the frequencies in the
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:12.800]   bundles work for pets? I guess we kind of talked about that. So everything except maybe a nutritional
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:18.960]   biobase, because it's not for the pet physiology. But you can pretty much, I mean, every other
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:24.880]   field, you know, every other frequency would be okay for pets, right? Yeah. So I mean, again,
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:30.640]   with the heel, heel and the biobase, I would not necessarily do just because the biobase is also
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:38.880]   part of the heel. And it's, you know, it's not necessarily what you want for your dog or you can
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:46.480]   probably because they just need different things. As you said, and, you know, I personally, at this
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:54.160]   point, all of those existing ones, actually, I think I can, I would, I would try the gratitude
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.560]   and she would have does will slowly to test that. And you'll, I know you'll test it.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:03.200]   Just turn to you. But watch Norma the other way. See what happened.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:08.320]   Yeah. But the other ones I really wouldn't turn on personally for for all pet, you know,
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:15.440]   I would just, for the pet just, all pet is getting the regular quantum upgrade with
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:20.960]   auto specific frequency and that's great. And at some point, I'm sure we'll have a pet
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:26.640]   frequency bundle and then that will look differently in that regard. But again,
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:33.520]   maybe the gratitude is great. You can try it wrong, but most of the frequencies right now,
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:39.200]   they're really geared towards humans. Okay. All right. Okay. Number three, how should we
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:45.280]   think about consent with frequencies in the home location? And, you know, we have so many people
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:50.000]   coming in at our house, wouldn't it be, you know, it wouldn't be feasible to get consent from
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.520]   every person if they wanted a certain frequency or not? Is it one of those things where they will
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:00.640]   accept what they want to accept or should we not use frequencies for home?
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:08.880]   Well, you do not need consent from visitors that are visiting your home because you also
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:16.320]   don't get consent from them. If you set up a Christmas tree or if you smudge with frankincense
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:22.560]   before they come all these things, like everyone has a specific energy in their home. And if you
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:27.760]   have visitors, they come to your home. It's not that you're going to their home and you bring a
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:33.120]   frequency there, right? So it's your home. So if you want to have the gratitude frequency in your
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.880]   home, then that's how your home is vibrating. And then people can choose if they want to come or
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:45.440]   if they don't want to come. And it's not that they're blasted with it, right? So it's not a the
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:51.360]   field for you would be different for that you would want to have consent. But it's actually your home
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:57.280]   is vibrating like that. And to be honest, frankly, probably for most people, it will be amazing, right?
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:03.280]   They will probably, you know, really get into the state of gratitude, possibly, or it will trigger
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:08.880]   some things that are in the way of them and their their gratitude. So yeah, no, you wouldn't need
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:14.960]   consent. You live with people. If you live with two, three roommates, for example, or your family,
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:22.240]   then you may want to check in with them, right? You know, if they're okay with this specific
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:26.640]   frequency, you know, that's probably what I would do. But but visitors, no, you're good.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:33.120]   I like that idea. It's just how your house resonates. Yeah, no, that's cool. Same thing with my car.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:40.560]   You know, right in my car, you have to listen to my music. Don't touch the temperature dial.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:47.600]   It's my temp, my music, it's my vibe. If you don't like it, get a get an Uber. Okay,
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.880]   no, that's good. That's a really cool way to look at it. So yeah, definitely, you know, do what makes
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:56.800]   your house feel right for you. And yeah, that's a good question. Good answer. Okay, so the last
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.840]   one here is there was a question about, you know, are there going to be specific plans for other
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:07.520]   frequency bundles beyond the two sets announced? And yes, we just we said, yeah, there's going to be
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:12.400]   a booster one. But then, you know, the question that gets more specific is like one with the focus
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:18.640]   frequency, which I don't I don't see would be great. Because he can't can't get my son to where
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:23.440]   the capsule consistently or hold a card. So that's that's really good. Because there's so many
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:28.160]   parents that want their child to have the focus frequency, right? Because of those reasons.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:35.200]   Is there going to be one for focus? So they can I think we will. Yes, I think we will definitely
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:41.760]   work on it. And I know that that question also came up in the telegram group just yesterday, I think,
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:47.840]   and and it really seems that there's a need for it. And people want it. So yeah, we'll make it
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:53.680]   happen. We'll think about it. And maybe that's also for the second part of January, where we can
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:47:00.000]   see how this can be added. Okay. All right, great. That answers that question. So that's the end of
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.200]   the questions. And the end of this little announcement video. So I just want to say, hey, thank you,
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:10.240]   Phillip, for your time. You know, this is going to be an awesome addition to the quantum upgrade
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:15.360]   service. So I hope everyone gives it a go ahead and, you know, and try it out and see how it works
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:21.200]   for you. Any can interrupt? Sure, sure. Yeah. So yeah, because I really wanted to,
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:29.760]   to also share with people that very soon we're coming up with this free product. So everyone that
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:35.920]   has had quantum upgrade and one way or another, whether it's a bundle or just a single service
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:44.400]   for three months, will soon, I think we'll started as of the beginning of January. But I think they'll
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:53.280]   get a free product, which is a free home slash location service, that they will get that they
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:48:00.080]   can assign to any location in the world that they wanted to, whether it's a hospital,
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:08.560]   a school, an animal shelter, it could also be your grandmother's house, whatever it may be,
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:16.240]   you'll get a free one for that. But the difference with that one is it's going to be preset
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.680]   to the level of 550 on the Hawkins scale. And if you don't know what that level is,
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:28.560]   go look it up on the Hawkins scale. At 550, you won't be able to pause it. You won't be able to
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:36.560]   scale it down or scale it up. It's 554 a reason. And just because that's a very great and wonderful
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:45.280]   baseline energy for any home, there's no consent needed or any of that. And yeah, we want to
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:53.760]   get more in the way in the habit of giving, also really trying to, that this service can be given
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:49:01.280]   a way to folks that may really need it. And yeah, that's just one way of doing it. We have more
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:07.360]   plans for 2023. But that's going to be the first thing that will be implemented in January.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.320]   Awesome. Okay. No, that's great. Yeah, that's a lot of stuff to look forward to. No, thank you
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:20.720]   very much for that. So you could just pick anywhere? Like, yes, yes, frankly, any, any location in the
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:26.960]   family or world that is, yes, exactly. Could you do a business location or just a physical location
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:34.640]   only? It could be, it could be, frankly, any location. Yes. Because at that level, it really is fine
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:43.120]   to do that. And it's your choice. You can pick and choose. I think most people would probably
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:48.080]   choose, I don't know, maybe there's a prison, maybe there's a school, an animal shelter. Those
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:53.760]   types of things, I think, are the ones that come to mind first. But hey, if you want to do that
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:58.960]   for your grandmother, go ahead and do that. If you want to do that for anyone else, a business
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:04.160]   location that you go to every now and then, fine, go ahead, do it. Yeah, I was thinking too that,
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:08.240]   you know, if for folks that sign up the business, right, because the businesses that have multiple
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:14.080]   locations, multiple offices, my first thought was like, Oh, now I can do my office, because I can
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:20.000]   do my business, right? You know, but it's multiple locations. So it's, it's, it's, it's a nebulous
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.200]   entity as opposed to a physical presence. So if you wanted to do your business as that
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:30.560]   nebulous entity called business, but I have a specific office location, I work in, that's kind
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:35.920]   of like my second home, I could then sign it up as my second home now. So that's kind of cool, right?
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:40.640]   Would that work? It would work. Yes. Cool. Yeah. Because everybody, I mean, you know,
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:45.520]   anybody that has a job, your job is your second home. You spend just as many hours there as you do
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:53.600]   sleeping a week, right? Yeah. I think we probably spend more time in our work locations than we do
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:58.640]   in our own house, if you tally it up, right? Because it's a lot of hours. But yeah, okay,
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:02.640]   no, that's cool. That that's great. So it's just going to be offered to everybody that's got a
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:11.680]   subscription. Yes. So everyone that has had it for three months or longer will get access to a free
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:17.280]   product like that. And I think sometime in the beginning of January, that will be available.
[00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:24.080]   Oh, that's great. Looking forward to that. Cool. Okay. Anything else? Any parting thoughts
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:28.720]   that you want to share? I'll wrap it up. Yes. And one more thing that's going to be coming
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:35.600]   also in the beginning of January is that there will be more levels that people can be unlocked for.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:42.240]   Oh, yeah. And that will actually show in your my subscription overview, if you go into your
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:50.960]   specific field for you as an example of the level 1,300 as a booster. So we're currently working on
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:58.560]   the levels 1,300 1,400 as additional booster levels for the future. That is nothing that will
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:05.440]   be available right or the gate gate. Of course, it's something that where we have to know there's
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:10.960]   a certain time period that you've had this already, that you do have the experience, that you do have
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:17.760]   the capacity and capability to actually take on such higher levels. But yeah, those are
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:24.560]   being made available. Okay. Yep. Yep. I saw that on my thing. Okay. Great. All right. Thanks,
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:29.840]   Philip. Really appreciate your time this morning. And everybody, I hope we got most of the questions
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:35.120]   answered. If not, just go ahead and go into our upgrade, a quantum upgrade community on Telegram.
