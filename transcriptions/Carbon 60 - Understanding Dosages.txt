[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   Aloha and welcome back to my three-part series on carbon 60. This is part two understanding dosages
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.080]   My name is calmer and thanks for stopping by
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.760]   Before I get into this I do want to do a little disclaimer because we're now talking about dosages
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.440]   And I just want to make it very very clear that this information is for research purposes only
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:27.720]   this is absolutely not medical advice and I also don't sell this stuff don't make this stuff don't know anybody who does make this stuff other
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.640]   Than individuals and I take no compensation in any form for doing these videos and lastly
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.360]   I really think it's important to state that no one should really ingest anything into your body based on a YouTube video
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.880]   I encourage everyone to do research before you do anything to yourself and to your critters
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.040]   So one other tiny thing is in part one when I was talking about the rat study
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.040]   I made a mention of how the C-60 was the C-60 oil was administered to the rats
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.680]   And I just want to clarify that it wasn't in the bloodstream and orally it was all done through their digestive system
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.000]   And what they were doing in the rat study was they were using gavages, which is like a feeding tube and they were also giving it
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.160]   orally through a syringe and
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.000]   At the end of the at the end of the day what they were worried that the feeding tube was gonna harm the rats
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.200]   So they stopped doing it with feeding tubes, and they just went it with syringes
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.880]   You know squirting it in their mouth, so it did not go into the bloodstream
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.920]   So every the way that the study was done was through the digestive system
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.360]   Okay, jump in the rat study now if you remember from part one the rat study dosage was
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.320]   1.7 milligrams of fullerenes
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:46.960]   per kilogram of body weight and that the saturation level of the C-60 fullerenes the powder in the oil was
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.000]   0.8 milligrams
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.800]   Or a per milliliter of the oil, and if you did quick math
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.400]   It's comes out to 2.125 milligram or milliliter sorry per kilogram of body weight
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.000]   So that's exactly like in liquid form. That's how much you need to take per kilogram of what you weigh
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Or what your big rat weighs or your horse weighs etc
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.040]   And so I did this little table just to do the simple math so it's easy to see so you can pause this thing take a peek at it
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.440]   But basically I broke out, you know five different
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.080]   weights
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.400]   And this is what the kilogram equivalent and then this would be the dose based on that 2.125 milliliters per kilogram
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.040]   And then I broke that out into ounces and again in tablespoons
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.760]   So you can kind of see what the rats were taking is if they if they were like large big rats
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.920]   So let's just take 200 pound rat
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.080]   You know take a look at that at six and a half ounces a day and that against this you know regiment
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.400]   Which is one per day for seven days and etc
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.760]   So that's a half a can of soda of oil that they were squishing down these little rats for the first week
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.440]   And then so forth so you can just imagine and this confirms that the entire study was based on
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.520]   toxicity they wanted to see how much these guys could take and they thought maybe they would die you know but
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.640]   Obviously the results were different. So that's quite a bit of oil
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.120]   Depending on what you weigh as a big rat
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.080]   so
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.680]   With that in mind
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.440]   You take a look at the product findings and this is the research that I did because you know
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.040]   What are we buying you because obviously you know we don't have the scientists making it for us
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.960]   So we got to go out and buy some of our own or your other option is to make your own which will be covered in part three
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.160]   So if you were to go out on the internet and try to buy you're gonna run into you know
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.920]   Basically these are the leading brands that pop up first and so I've kind of arranged them one through nine
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.840]   From the lowest priced one to the highest priced one
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.720]   And you'll see what that looks like when we talk about the economics of doing doing this
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.440]   And then and then really just let's just talk about for a second. What are you taking when you buy?
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.800]   These products and how do they relate to the rat study?
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.180]   Which is really important because you if everyone's trying to
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.520]   Get the results that the rats had you're clearly gonna want to take the exact same formula that was used in that study, right?
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.160]   Right, so the rat study again 0.8 milligrams of fullerenes per milliliter
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.320]   And then they also claim in the rat study that they use a fullerene purity of
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.060]   99.98% purity and then also the oil as you remember came from Tunisia very special
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.260]   Specific farm not special but specific farm in Tunisia. I think it was Talaya area or something like that
[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.600]   and and when I look through all of these
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.040]   manufacturers, a none of them claim to have used or are using that specific
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.000]   Oil from that specific area of Tunisia
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.800]   So right off the bat none of the products for sale match what was used in the study based just on oil and of course these vendors here
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.320]   They're using extra virgin olive oil. Some are using virgin olive oil. Some are using sunflower oil
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.200]   Avocado oil and coconut oil, so it's kind of all over the scale
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.440]   There's actually one vendor here that actually uses a special blend of oil that they created themselves
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.140]   from their research that indicated what had the best
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.720]   Saturation level for the it's fullerenes within a certain type of oil
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.640]   And so they actually came up with their special blend and if you take a look at it's real interesting
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.820]   It's this guy right here. They were actually able to get a saturation of fullerenes
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.680]   To at 1.0 milligrams per milliliter whenever one else basically was hitting 0.8 as it was in the study
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.960]   You've got a couple of vendors that are a little bit lower than that. So again, you've got some vendors that come that
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.880]   Comply I guess to the you know, I look at the rat study as the benchmark. They set the bar
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.800]   So you've got some 0.8s there
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.880]   They set them, you know that matches the study and then you've got one over one couple blow
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.900]   Oh, I don't let me just point out to you these empty cells right here in the table
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.320]   Are just simply the manufacturers that didn't respond to me. I reviewed all of the websites for all of these vendors every page on every
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.040]   Website and I also if I couldn't find the information
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:10.480]   I also sent an email out to them and asking them, you know, could you tell me what this data is so that I could fill out this table?
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.520]   I was I was doing a comparative analysis, and they just didn't respond. They all had a week to respond. I didn't hear from them
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.400]   I don't think that's a bad thing or a good thing. It's just that, you know, they just didn't respond
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.760]   So I don't have that data
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.680]   So lastly if you remember we have 99.98 percent purity was what was used in the study
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.200]   And we look at the purity of the fullerenes itself the powder help here was that powder, you know
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.560]   It is derived from taking, you know, and you take the
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.920]   I guess they're using shungite or coil and they just crush it down and then they're using solvents and bake it off and
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.120]   Put more solvents in and then heat it up and bake off the solvents
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.360]   But that, you know, the the difference here is that 99.98 is the absolute best purity
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.080]   That's for sale if you go to SES research where the scientists got their fullerenes and so it goes
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.760]   98.98 is the top
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:07.160]   Purity it goes to 99.95 is the next level down and then 99.90 is the lowest
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.680]   Level of purity and you know, I don't know
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.560]   how those differences are going to affect you and in in your dosages that none of that's been defined yet
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   But it just makes it really clear if you look at this table
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:27.800]   Again, just like to oil none of the vendors are using the same quality of fullerenes. That's neither good nor bad
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   It just is what they're doing
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.960]   But it is something to note so that this whole slide just shows you that there is nothing for sale that matches
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.760]   What was used in the study? Okay, that's just a data point not good not bad. It just is
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.400]   And then you take a look at
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.400]   What are those vendors or what are those vendors recommending for dosages?
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   And I would say just definitely take a you know, pause this slide and take a peek at it and kind of take a good look at it because
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:59.960]   It's all over the map. You've got vendors out there saying hey, you know, take two or three milliliters per day
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.640]   And take, you know, if you go back to the rat study and just if you're a average adult male in america
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:15.240]   It's 196 pounds is the average now, you know, the recommendation for if you wanted to do the rat study is to take 192.8 milliliters
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.000]   a day
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.760]   And then you look here and you've got, you know, like these folks down here and they're saying oh
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:28.360]   Take two, you know, take two versus a 90 190, you know, so you know that this so it's a wide spectrum
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.240]   That's my point. I want to make all of these vendors though
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.200]   Uh, you know have their own way of doing it. The most interesting ones are
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:43.000]   the ones that actually did some math to kind of figure out that hey, you know, it's not necessarily
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.320]   Related to the study because the study was based on toxicity. They were trying to poison the rats
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.080]   so they
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:57.160]   Determined and they don't explain how they determined that they would just do allometric scaling and they would just say oh
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.120]   Well, we're just going to do 30 percent of what they did in the study
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.560]   Because you know they were trying to poison the rats. We're not trying to poison, you know, you shouldn't be trying to poison yourself instead
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.880]   You should you know, this is what they recommended. So their research research shows
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.600]   Specifically, uh, bucky labs and this vendor number three
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:22.280]   That to take a 30 percent of the rat study dosage. What's what's funny is number four, you know, this vendor just goes
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.400]   You just refers you to the rat studies like you know, we're not going to recommend anything
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.120]   You go read the study this other guy makes no claims so forth
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.000]   So this is what people are who are selling this stuff are recommending
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.840]   And whether or not it works for you is a whole big question that is yet to be discovered because no one's done a human study
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.160]   So is it good? Is it bad? Is it enough?
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.840]   Maybe not, but you know, there is no definitive and that's the point of this
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.280]   Slide is that there is no definitive recommended dosage by any of the folks selling this stuff
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.800]   And none of this stuff aligns to the rat study
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:01.160]   And then most importantly here is is what's the economics of of doing
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.360]   Uh, c60 yourself or with your horse or dog or cat
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.000]   Uh, as opposed as it relates to the rat study and so based on the rat study
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.360]   Which was if you remember the average male is 196. This is just the
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.960]   Uh, this is just what i'm using for this table so you can understand the context
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:22.040]   Uh, it said it was six and a half ounces day for the you know, uh, 200 pound human or sorry 200 pound rat
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.680]   And so if you take that much
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.600]   C60 oil, this is what it costs you
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.960]   Um, it's if you i'm sorry if you're familiar with my pricing study
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:37.080]   This is what i come out with in the last pricing guide for all of these vendors. This is their best deal
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.040]   Uh, and if you break it down to what it costs per ounce
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:45.240]   So you've got this brand up here number one has got the lowest and of course number nine's got the highest
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.600]   Per ounce price. So if you were to use these products and try to duplicate the amount of
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.880]   Uh, C60 oil that was taken by the rats and you are a rat and you're trying to take this stuff
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:01.480]   It's going to cost you and depending on which vendor you choose it could cost you up to $189
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.520]   per dose or as cheap as 37, but
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:11.160]   Wow, $37 a dose is you know, and so it's it's there's a lot of uh issues here with the economics
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.160]   And then if you actually just stretch it out, right?
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.560]   Because no one's just going to take one dose
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.320]   Uh, if you follow the regiment, uh, i over here in this six month column
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:24.200]   If you followed the regiment of the rat study and you took these products, uh, this is what it's going to cost you
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   in the first six months
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.240]   It could be as low as $854 or with this product here. It could be as high as 4,600
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.960]   So there's a lot of things to consider economically when you're trying to
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.240]   Um, add this to your regiment, uh, or you know, take this for whatever reasons you're taking it
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:47.720]   The idea though is simply choose wisely or make it yourself. We'll talk about that in face or part three
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.600]   Okay, so the next one i want to talk about
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:57.480]   Is the dosage considerations i i've been chewing on this for quite a while i started taking this about four or five months ago
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.560]   Been thinking a lot about it, um, experimenting with different brands
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:07.560]   Um, but the at the end of the day, you know, if you're considering or are taking c60 or giving it to your critters
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.880]   Uh, you know, some of the considerations are the very first thing is is you know, what's your goal?
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.800]   Uh, you know, are you taking and or you want to take or you want to use it for your animal?
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.240]   To just see what happens are you you just you heard that c60 is 172 times more
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.440]   Stronger as an antioxidant you just want to add it to your other supplements that you're taking
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:31.720]   Uh, you know folks out there looking at it from as an anti-cancer a damage repair
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.040]   Uh, you know, there's this great, uh, story
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.000]   Uh, i read on twitter of a lady who has a horse
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.160]   Uh, it's been lame for like eight years and you know when you're blamed you
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.920]   A horse is lame. So, uh, you don't write them and it's kind of uh, you just you know, they can't really move around much
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:53.080]   But uh, she said she started giving her a horse c60 and uh, the horse is trotting around just fine
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.360]   You can't even tell it's lame
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.840]   So, you know, a damage repair is obviously a very, uh, good goal
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.560]   Or life extension, you know, as as like the rats live 90% longer than other rats
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.120]   Or simply is your goal just to outlive your ex
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:11.560]   Uh, you know, that's a very viable goal and and any any one of these things would be a good reason
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.320]   But the reason that you're gonna choose really determines on how much you want to take
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.960]   You know, uh, and that's just something to think about
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.760]   The other thing that i wanted to share with you was just the other considerations that i have
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:28.280]   As specific to the rat study where the rats are, you know, they only live 30 to 36 months
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.880]   Uh, those are male wheel star rats. This is their, uh, lifespan
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.440]   And then humans, the average human male lives, uh, in america is 78 years
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.720]   And so humans have a 26% longer lifespan
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.440]   So, you know, how does that relate to the rat study and the amount of c60 you might be considering taking?
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.960]   Well, first of all
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.680]   We live a lot longer so one the first thing that comes to mind when i think that is the toxic load
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.800]   We've had, you know, we have a lot longer to live
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.960]   Which means you have a lot more bio accumulations of metals and toxins
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:03.960]   Into your bloodstream in your body that you've got build up over time and that the rats did not have and so
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:09.080]   Uh, that kind of lends to the idea of hey, maybe you should just do a big load up front
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.280]   And then maintain afterwards or may even take more
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.560]   To get all that crud and sludge out of your body
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.320]   So, you know keeping in mind if you look at the starting point right here
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:23.320]   That the rats started taking c60 at 10 months
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.520]   And that's 28% into their lifespan
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:32.280]   And so to translate that to the average human male in america, that means that you'd have to start taking
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:37.560]   Um c60 at 22 years old and and follow the regiment to the end of time, right?
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.720]   Uh, now if you look at the rest of us with 30 40 50 and 60 years old
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.840]   You can see how we started really eating into that timeline
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.800]   So that if you're 50 years old right now and you start at c60
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.480]   You're starting at 64 percent into your life your lifespan
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.720]   Okay, that's compared to the rat so you know
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.560]   It's really difficult to compare
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.800]   Us to the rat study because we're so far along and the rats were when they started taking it
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.840]   And then of course they were taking this mega dose and and you could see from the vendor recommendations
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.640]   You know, if you're taking it based on what they said you're taking a lot less than the rats
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.600]   and so
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:17.320]   Definitely factors to put into your calculations on on how much you want to take because you are doing the research as well
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:22.600]   And the last bullet I think that's very very very important here is you know, we all know we're not rats, right?
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.880]   That's just duh
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.840]   But look at the exponentially higher stress loads
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:33.160]   So not only do you have a longer period of time to bioacumulate toxins and and metals than rats would
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:38.680]   But the other thing was that in the study it actually said the rats were housed in individual cages in air conditioned
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.720]   You know at comfort, okay, so and they're all male
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.120]   So think about from that perspective
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:49.480]   They don't have the stress of having to deal with females and you'll all understand what I mean by that
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.200]   They also were sitting around comfort in in in cages and being fed every day
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.920]   I mean how stressful is that if you're a rat the rest of us, right? We got to get up every day
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.560]   We got to go to work. We got to fight in traffic. We got to deal with kids
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.120]   We have to deal with teenagers and toddlers and that's a lot of stress
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.560]   And so we have a much higher load of stress
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:14.360]   So not only do you have to you have a buildup as a as a critter a big critter
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.040]   of
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.280]   Toxins and metals because you have live longer, but you also have a lot more stress
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.680]   So you've got this huge load on you that the rats didn't have
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.880]   And that is also very important to consider when you start deciding how you want to dose yourself
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:36.040]   So after looking at all this data doing all of this research reading everything I could read
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:42.200]   The at you know at the end of the day the dosage conclusion is nobody knows yet. It's all just research
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:48.040]   So you are actually part of that research if you're taking it your dog's taking it your horse is taking it
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:55.880]   You're part of that body of knowledge that being accumulated disease is how much does what and and that's that's the fantastic part of this whole
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:02.200]   Science is that you know the study only came out five years ago. It's in its infancy. We're all doing it together
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:09.000]   We're all learning together. So thank you for stopping by. This is my understanding dosages presentation
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.720]   Stay tuned for part three
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.920]   On making your own c60 oil where i'll be going over
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.720]   Of course how to do it
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.760]   What to consider when you're doing it the how much it's going to cost
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.200]   And so forth. So thanks again for stopping by
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.560]   I really appreciate your time and have a great day.
