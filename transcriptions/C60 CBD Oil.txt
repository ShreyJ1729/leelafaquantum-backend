[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   Hello and welcome to my video on C60 CBD Oil. My name is Kalmer and before I get
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.640]   started I'd like to just give you a couple of quick disclaimers. This video
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.920]   is not medical advice in any way, shape, or form. It is purely my own objective
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.360]   and subjective opinion. I am not endorsing any products of any kind and I'm not
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.360]   selling anything to you and I am not getting paid to do this video. What I, why
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.960]   I do these videos is I have an insatiable curiosity to learn new things, mostly of
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.160]   the scientific nature, and I just like to share what I've been learning. So let's
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.200]   jump right in and let's start talking about what is C60 and what is CBD. First
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.440]   starters, now the C60 is simply a carbon molecule made up of 60 carbon atoms in
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.000]   the shape of what they call a bucky ball. It looks like a little soccer ball and
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.200]   these little things are really, really, really tiny and and what they've been
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.360]   found to do is they actually have a lot of incredible health effects and what
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.440]   CBD oil is, is the canada banal. It's a byproduct of the cannabis plant, the
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.520]   cannabis sativa, also known as marijuana, hemp weed, you name it, and when they
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.520]   actually take an extract of it, it kind of breaks into two areas. One is CBD, which
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.440]   is the non-get-high part, and then there's the THC, which is the, quote,
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.880]   psychoactive chemical. So CBD is not the, not the part of the hemp plant that will
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.640]   get you high, but what they find scientists have found is that it also,
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.880]   just like C60, has some really interesting health benefits. So when you
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.320]   take a look at those health benefits, what really stands out is, first of all,
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.760]   inflammation. And if you've done any homework on what inflammation does to our
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   bodies, it literally is the root cause of a lot of problems. And so they both
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.560]   attack inflammation and they both improve it and they relieve it. One
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.520]   prevents one relieves. I mean, it isn't, if you look at this list and you just go
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.560]   ahead and pause and take a read and read this, this slide, and you kind of see how
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.200]   each one does a separate thing, but together, you know, it kind of creates a
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.120]   super supplement. And that's kind of what really kind of made me very
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.320]   interested in combining the two together, because I've been taking C60 for about
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.520]   five months now. I've been seeing some interesting results. I did try taking
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.360]   CBD oil for a couple of weeks this January, and I really wasn't seeing any
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.840]   results. And then in when I started making C60 oil myself using olive oil and
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.560]   coconut oil, it dawned on me that, well, you know, CBD is another oil. Why don't I
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.920]   go ahead and combine the two and see what the results of the combined two
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.040]   supplements would be. So that's kind of how I came about my thought process and
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.600]   why I made CBD oil with C60 in it. But I think one of the things when you look
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.440]   at the benefits and these are two incredibly healthy supplements that you
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.160]   can take and why not just combine them together? Because one of the concepts
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.200]   that I've always kind of carried in my head is this quote from Aristotle that
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.000]   the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. So what I was thinking was, hey,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.880]   you know, let's combine these two and see what happens. And let's, you know,
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.640]   just let's try it. But the thing that about C60, for those of you who are new
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.920]   to it, is that C60 is a water-soluble compound. And so what that means is if
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.200]   you can't just, you know, dump the C60 and the CBD oil or any oil and then
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.240]   stir it up and you're good. I mean, what has to happen is you have to really
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.560]   inject a lot of energy into the oil with C60 in it to create what they call a
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.320]   liposome. So and then the byproduct of creating a liposome using C60 as you
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.520]   create this, this basically, this is the word for it, is you create a lipo
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.760]   fullerene. Now, the idea of what a liposome is, is when you induce energy,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.240]   when I say energy, the energy in the act of stirring for a long period of time,
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.920]   or the act of energy using ultrasonics, which is basically like shaking
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.480]   something, but just shaking it at an extreme rate. And so the idea is is when
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.520]   you do that and you inject energy into a solution of oil with a water-soluble
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.080]   compound, this is what happens is you created liposome. And what a liposome
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.960]   is is there's two parts of fat cells and you basically activate through, you know,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.560]   energy that the fat cells start to cling to each other. First, the fat cells will
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.840]   start clinging around whatever nutrient you use and then it'll attract other
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.600]   fat cells. And then what happens is you create like this little kinder egg with
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.360]   whatever you wanted to put inside of it. Now, actual scientists out there in the
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.480]   world today are using liposomes to deliver drugs into the human body. And the
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.040]   reason that they're doing it this way, because if you just take C60 or even
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.640]   vitamin C for that matter, that's also water-soluble, if you just take it as a
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.480]   pill or you drink it in water, it's just going to flush straight through you. I
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.840]   mean, literally within hours. But if your body sees it as like, you know, this
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.840]   little kinder egg with a fat wrapped around it, it's going to see it as
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.200]   something the body wants, the body will absorb it, it'll take off, it'll take it
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.280]   into the body, into the bloodstream, it'll strip off the fat as, you know, as it
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.840]   eats the fat off. And then, and then all of a sudden, now you've got that
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.800]   nutrient C60 or whatever else you're going to create, floating around in your
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.760]   bloodstream, going to wherever it needs to go. So this is the concept here that
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:55.000]   you have to follow when you're trying to make CBD C60 oil, because it's not just
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.160]   a matter of stirring. It is a matter of creating this liposome, and there's two
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.920]   ways to do it, which is again, you can stir it for a really long time using
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.560]   magnetic stirs, or you can use an ultrasonic cleaner that they use for
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.280]   jewelry and parts. But it also can suffice as as something you could use to
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.680]   create a lipofluering. So when you want to go ahead and do this, the idea here is,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.120]   this is what I did, this is my experiment right here. The materials that I use was
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.200]   a Charlotte's Web, CBD oil, it's a popular brand, I wanted to get something
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.280]   that was reputable. I used the strong, I bought the strongest bottle you could
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.480]   get, you know, in terms of hemp extract at 1500 milligrams per 30 milliliters,
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.520]   and it was it was pricey at $149.99, and then I purchased the C60
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:51.840]   fullerenes, the C60 powder at 99.95% purity, got and then added 25 milligrams
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.600]   of that in the in the little bottle of CBD oil, and that cost was $27.50. So this
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.800]   is not a cheap thing to do, it did cost me $177.49 just for the ingredients. Now
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.880]   I have all this equipment, so it's kind of a net zero to me, but if you're
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.400]   actually going to go out and do this, you need to get yourself a 50 milliliter
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.280]   flask, an ultrasonic cleaner, and a magnetic stirrer. So one thing about the
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.920]   stirrer is, there's been scientific studies that kind of say you may or may
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.000]   not need to stir before you go ahead and and use the cleaner, the ultrasonic
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.440]   cleaner, that's kind of subjective at this point. It really depends on on what
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.520]   you want to do. I decided that I wanted to use the magnetic stir first, and I
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.800]   stirred it overnight, so I really, really wanted to make sure that the C60 is
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.600]   suspended in the oil before I inject energy into it to create liposomes. And
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.360]   the reason is, is I was doing a lot of C60 oil, I was making a lot of C60 oil the
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.560]   other weekend, and I kind of just did it two different ways. One I would stir in
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.840]   between cycles and one I didn't, and it really made a huge difference in that
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.160]   you have to lift off the C60 off the bottom of the cleaner and get it up into
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.560]   the oil as a, as a, you know, suspend it, and then zap it, and then it was
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.520]   actually going to turn darker a lot faster. If you just let the thing run and
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.760]   you didn't stir, then the C60 would just sit at the bottom of the cleaner, and I
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.560]   wouldn't, it wouldn't infuse it with the oil. So really important point that is
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:30.520]   either you stir by hand, or in my case I decided to stir overnight. So the actual
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:37.720]   methodology I followed to make C60 CBD oil was I placed the CBD oil in a flask,
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.400]   added C60 to it, and then I put it on the magnetic stir overnight at room
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.320]   temperature. I wasn't messing around with temperature too much this time. And then
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.400]   the very next day, you know, we take the magnet out, and a little easy trick on
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.320]   doing that is I have a little Neomitty magnet, and I just kind of just grabbed
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:00.720]   the little stir magnet from inside the flask, and just pull it up out of the
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.320]   top of the flask using another magnet. Because I kind of had a chew on that one,
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.600]   how was I going to get that magnet out? And then place the flask in the cleaner
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.080]   itself, and that's the cleaner I was using, a real high tech, because I haven't got
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:21.320]   my new one yet. And I filled the cleaner up with hot tap water, not hot, not hot
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.600]   to the touch, but you know, warm up to the top of the oil that was in the flask, so
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.800]   that you'll see it in the video here in a second. And then I ran it for eight
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.440]   times at 480 seconds per run. That's the timer maximum on this machine. So I ran
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.720]   it eight times for a total of 64 minutes. And I stirred in between each run as I
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.800]   meant, but I couldn't walk. Sorry, I didn't stir. I couldn't stir the little
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.320]   opening of the flask was so tiny. That basically I would just grab the flask and
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:53.760]   swirl as a scientific term. I swirled it, and then I, you know, put it back in the
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.480]   water, turn the machine back on. So let's take a peek and I'll just kind of walk
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.920]   you through the short video that I made while trying, while trying to do this
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:08.040]   other experiment. So right here is the product that I used. It was the Sarlit
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.600]   Swab C60. I used them in chocolate one, because this does not taste good. Okay,
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.880]   I'll just flat out admit it. If you've tasted C60 in olive oil, yeah, it's not
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.400]   a glory. It's not a great taste. So I went with them in chocolate. And let me
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.160]   tell you, it makes a huge difference. You don't really taste the C60. And then
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:33.400]   this is the C60 Vile. One gram of C60 powder costs $110 from and I bought it
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:39.080]   from Bucky Labs. There's also many other different sources of C60 powder, but
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.520]   this is just the one I went with. There's the least expensive and not have to do
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.480]   with buying it from Canada. And of course, this is my little tiny flask in my funnel.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:53.200]   So I went ahead and I poured the C60 in the flask and put in a quarter of a
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.960]   gram or 250 milligrams of the C60 powder and I, and then I put it on the
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.200]   stir. Now that's my magnetic stir in the back and that's what it looks like when
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.600]   it was stirring. So I basically kept this thing on. It was just overnight. And
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.960]   really again, I just want to remind everybody who's making this that you
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.040]   need to. It didn't just sit on the counter. I had to cover it and keep it
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:19.400]   dark. As soon as you got it going, remember to cover it and keep it dark. C60 is
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:25.320]   very, very sensitive to light. So once you've got it in the oil, keep it dark. If
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.840]   it's in that little vile, it comes in this mylar dark blue mylar bag. Keep
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.080]   everything dark as much as possible. Even after I made it and put it back in
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.720]   the bottle, which the bottle itself is dark, that it comes in because CBD oil
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.560]   itself is sensitive to light. And so just keep everything dark as much as
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.280]   possible. Obviously, you know, when you're taking it, it's out in the open, but
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.080]   keep it dark. So I was stirring it like that and I kept it that way overnight. So
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.640]   this is where I basically take the flask the very next day. It took the
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.400]   magnet out, put it inside the cleaner, filled up the cleaner. You can see where
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.680]   the water line is equal to the water or the oil line, I guess, inside the flask.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:09.240]   And then I turned on the cleaner. And what's interesting is you can
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.920]   actually see, if you watch this little clip right here, you can see the water
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:17.240]   gravitating and you can see that the oil inside the flask is moving around.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.920]   All the bubbles are coming up to the top, whatever air is trapped in there,
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.600]   is going to come up to the top and you will be able to actually zap it inside of a
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.240]   flask inside of water. So this is what the coloration looks like when I was done.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.640]   This is after 64 minutes and it was quite dark. And so to kind of give you a
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:40.760]   comparison, right here is, I have two bottles of the same type of oil. One's
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.480]   just a different product. But this was the color of the oil before I started.
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.720]   And this is what the color of the oil. Now, as you will know, I'm in a home
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.440]   lab. It's my kitchen and that's my lab. And you know, so I don't have a
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.280]   spectrometer. I don't have the big expensive machines
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.720]   that are going to actually measure the saturation point.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:07.240]   You know, we do know from scientific studies that the saturation point of C60
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.320]   in olive oil is 0.8 milligrams per milliliter.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.120]   There's been other individuals, other scientists that have been able to
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:20.600]   achieve a 1.0 milligram per milliliter using blends of oils.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.720]   And so it's really difficult to actually give you
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.960]   an exact number in terms of how much of the 0.25 grams
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.480]   of the C60 was dissolved in the oil.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:34.680]   So, you know, it is an estimate. And then how I estimate
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.200]   is basically I look at the coloration of the oil. How much
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.880]   darker did it get, you know, in terms of when I mixed the C60 in it?
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.560]   And so you can see from this little clip that it actually got quite a bit
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.960]   darker and that kind of implies, okay, that there is definitely
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:55.640]   C60 infused into the oil to cause the oil to get darker.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.320]   And then the other part, obviously, is how much C60
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.320]   is left in the vial. And I'm sorry, I apologize. I forgot to film
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.040]   what was left in the vial. But there was a residue of C60 at the very bottom of
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.960]   the vial. And it was very minute, but it was
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.680]   there. So there's a little bit left behind.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.680]   But most of it was infused into the oil
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:24.120]   and gave me this coloration to kind of show that, hey, you know, that the C60
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.440]   was dissolved into the oil. So that's the original one
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.640]   that I started with. And then this is what
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.160]   it ended up being. So you could see how really, really dark
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.880]   dark green that is. And that's kind of a shot at what it looks like on the plate.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:44.840]   So, you know, when I was finished with this, I put it back in its original bottle.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.720]   And at the end of the day, you know, why do this
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.320]   is and is I just wanted to see what would happen.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.000]   And what would happen from the standpoint of, you know,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.240]   if I took it. And so the kind of story, the story that I have to share with you,
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:05.080]   and this is completely anecdotal. It is completely subjective. It is my opinion.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.080]   Your results will vary absolutely 100% of the time.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.120]   We're all completely different and different things that
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.000]   affect us differently. So this is just my story.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.120]   So what I did was I had two of these vials. I had two little bottles of C60.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.280]   The first one that I didn't mess with. There's the exact same
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.920]   strength or 1500 milligrams of hemp extract in the vial.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:33.560]   The first one I took for two weeks in January. And I absolutely didn't feel
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.440]   any different. And I'm one of those individuals
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.960]   that can take a lot of something and not feel it.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.760]   And so I just have this ability to not really get
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:49.080]   overly affected by anything. And so I took it for two weeks exactly as
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.480]   it says in the bottle, which is twice a day, about a third of the vial.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.240]   And, you know, I mean of the dropper. And I didn't feel anything. For two solid
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.840]   weeks, I didn't feel a thing. It didn't affect me at all.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.240]   And so that's why I kind of was deciding as I was making C60 oil using
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.960]   other oils. I was thinking, well, why don't I try this and see if it makes a
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.080]   difference. And so I want to share with you, and this is my
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.640]   anecdotal, extremely preliminary results.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.040]   And so I waited a week to make this video. I made the oil last weekend
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.920]   today, it's Sunday, and it's been a whole week. And I've been taking this twice a
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.120]   day. And I will tell you, and this is my personal
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:32.040]   opinion for me and that I actually feel it now.
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:37.960]   For this entire week, I have just felt an immense
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.640]   deep sense of calm. And that's the only thing when I was thinking about making
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.960]   this video was, well, what I say, you know, about how it changes me. And it's just
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.920]   the words deep sense of calm. And that's what I'm feeling.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.080]   And like most of you, you know, and I kind of joke about this, but it's kind of
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:59.640]   true. You know, I have this vehicular Tourette syndrome thing going.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.640]   You know, I mean, if you've ever been in Honolulu, it's just as bad as any
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.640]   major metropolis. You get into traffic, and, you know, and it's just
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.240]   the people in traffic just drive me nuts. And I kind of vent.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.960]   And you know, it's like a Tourette syndrome moment.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.640]   And I'm swearing, you know, as people cut me off, and you name it, and it's very
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.240]   stressful. I don't like being a traffic at all. I hate it so much.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.720]   And then, of course, the job. And, you know, so I have this daily stress.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:30.040]   And so this whole week for the first time, and as I that I can even remember,
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.600]   I was just calm. I mean, I was just calm.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.200]   I'm so surprised that I had and actually had a reaction.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:44.840]   But all week long, every day, in and out of traffic to working back,
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.400]   I was calm. And I wasn't reacting. And nothing bothered me.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.720]   And we had some real crazy stuff going on at work that no one normally kind of,
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:58.200]   you know, make you upset. People doing weird and stupid stuff.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.640]   No, nothing. I was just calm. I was just doing my job.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.440]   Being happy. I mean, I'm sorry. Not being happy. I can't say that I was
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.360]   happy. I was just calm. You know, stuff wasn't getting to me.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:13.000]   And that's a major thing. And so I was really impressed.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.160]   So that's only the first week. Who knows? Next week, you know, what'll happen.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.840]   But the whole idea that I did this experiment was when I took a look at the
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.640]   health benefits, and this is straight out of Google, just go into Google and go
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.360]   health benefits of C60 and boom, this list will pop up.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.000]   Health benefits of CBD oil, boom, that list will pop up.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.400]   And then you can click on all the bunch of different links that will
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.040]   explain how this stuff helps you and what it does for you.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.920]   But when you look at what each one can do by itself,
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.440]   and then you think about, wow, what can it do together?
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.960]   I'm actually, that's what is, you know, driving my
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.760]   curiosity, and that's what drove this experiment.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:55.160]   And the result for me was a deep sense of calm. So that was it.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.080]   Thank you so much for stopping by. I'm really happy that I'm able to share this
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.760]   information with you, and I really hope that you guys try it yourself.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.840]   And see what happens and share in the comments, make your own videos,
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.320]   whatever, but just add to this body of knowledge.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.360]   Because, you know, when I went on YouTube and to try to see, you know,
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.440]   what did other people do when they, you know, did CBD-60 oil, right?
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.880]   And I couldn't find anybody that made anything like this.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:24.600]   So it's kind of like a new thing, and it's definitely something that
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.200]   is pretty amazing for me. So I hope that you've enjoyed this video.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.520]   I really appreciate you stopping by. I mean, you know, I know you're busy.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.280]   So, thank you very much and have a great day and aloha.
