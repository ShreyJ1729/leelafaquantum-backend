[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another tinker's academy video. I'm your host K Almer and in this
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.600]   video let's talk about 10 ridiculously expensive biohacks for Christmas. So now it's November,
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.160]   right? So what do most people start thinking about? Christmas and if money is not an option for you
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.360]   and you have a biohacker in your life who's obsessed about their health and performance,
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.120]   then this list is for you because these are the 10 most ridiculously expensive biohacks you could
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.040]   possibly consider if money is not an option. Let's jump in. All right, number one hyperbaric
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.640]   oxygen therapy h bot for short. Now the cost of hyperbaric oxygen chambers varies really depending
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.000]   on the type and also the location. So you could either go to a clinic that has one of these
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.760]   these devices which is a chamber that infuses oxygen into you or you could buy one for your home.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.280]   So now they do range quite a bit. Now treatment sessions in the US go from anywhere from 200
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.120]   to 1250. So you could sign someone up for treatments. Just keep in mind that it takes about 60 sessions
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.760]   for the actual effects to really kick in and you start noticing effects. So it can get kind of
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.400]   pricey at that range. So initial courses of treatment can range anywhere from three to
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.240]   $26,000. Now if you wanted to get a chamber for your home, there's soft shelves and hard shelves.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.680]   The hard are the soft shelves are more of the home type of chambers that people are buying and
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.720]   they range anywhere from $3,000 to $20,000. But you can also get one for your home. Now,
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.720]   of course, rich people do have one of these in their home. A lot of them do Michael Jackson did.
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.480]   Now the medical hyperbaric chambers are the hard ones and they actually have,
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.720]   they're actually more efficient because they can hold more pressure and those range anywhere from
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.200]   60 to $120,000 depending on size. So that would be the first choice for anyone who's interested in
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.200]   hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The next one up here is personal saunas. Can't say enough about personal
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.360]   saunas and the and the benefit that they have for your health. And the thing about those is that
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.160]   they range, you know, costs for home saunas typically falls anywhere between three and $10,000 heavily
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.680]   dependent on the choice between infrared and traditional steam types and the sauna size. So
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.240]   you can get anywhere from a single person all the way to, you know, big as big as you can imagine,
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.960]   right? So that's the whole idea. Of course materials use the type of wood so forth and the
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.120]   customization and don't forget the installation. Now some of these things do come, you know,
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.040]   basically on a pallet and you build it yourself or you hire someone to build it which even increases
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.680]   the cost even more. But personal saunas are a great gift and a great way to move your health
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.840]   in terms of just improving your health overall. The benefits are incredible. The next one up are
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.960]   cold plunge tubs. Now, of course, if you go on Amazon and one of the things about this list is
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.080]   I have excluded all the cheap crap from Alibaba and Ali Express and none of this, you know, cheap
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.680]   stuff from China. If you wanted to get a high quality cold plunge tub from a reputable US
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.040]   manufacturer who then will also service the tub if anything goes long. Now, of course,
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.200]   it's the tub and the chiller and they can cost as much as up to $10,000 thanks to the electric
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.520]   chiller, you know, that that rapidly cools the water, keeping that water cold and keeping it
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.040]   filtered. Obviously, you avoid having all the costs of having to do ice bags and so forth. So
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.600]   obviously, you know, they do, like I said, sell really cheap, crappy stuff on Amazon you can get
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.640]   from like 500 bucks. The chillers are, you know, anywhere from that range as well up to, you know,
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.680]   $1,500, $2,000 for chillers. But the idea here is that if you want to get a high quality cold
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.480]   plunge tub, you put inside your house or outside your out in your backyard, it's going to cost
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.400]   you anywhere from most likely about seven to $10,000 for one of those things. And it makes a great
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.800]   Christmas gift. Maybe not needed in the winter, but hey, it's a great gift. The other thing you
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.240]   can think about to know this has been kind of been popularized lately by a, you know, one of the
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.640]   biohackers out there and he needs been doing this. And so it kind of made the press lately. But it's
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.440]   something called plasma transfusion therapy, also known as anti aging blood transfusion. Now it's
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.240]   basically short for PRP treatment. If you can find a medical provider that'll do this for you,
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:14.400]   basically you find a young person willingly volunteering to donate their plasma. And then
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.160]   the whole process is they extract a plasma out of a young person. And the range for any individual
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.200]   treatment can be up, you know, $500 to $2,500 per treatment. And then they would then basically
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.360]   infuse and replace, you know, your plasma with the young person plasma. And it is quite a anti aging
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.160]   hack. And it's actually gains in popularity. And of course, celebrities are doing it. Of course,
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.320]   the costs can vary depending on locations and facilities and the expertise of the doctor
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.040]   performing the treatment. Obviously, it's not covered under insurance. And it's not just
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.000]   2500 for a treatment. It's you have to do multiple treatments throughout the year. So this can come
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.040]   in, you know, this could be in the range of anywhere from 10 to $20,000 a year to actually
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.480]   continually have young person plasma for anti aging effects as a biohack. The other one too,
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.960]   here is step cell therapy that kind of falls in the same game, you know, the same area where
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.400]   stem cell therapy, the cost really depends. You know, it really varies on the type of procedure
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.280]   and the stem cells use. Now, on the average, stem cell therapy costs can range anywhere from
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.840]   $5,000 to $50,000 per, you know, treatment for specific treatments. A single stem cell injection
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.520]   can cost $4,000 with just additional joints or injuries treated during the same session,
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.360]   costing as little as 800. So basically go in, they extract some stuff out of you, they pull up the
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.800]   stem cells, grow them, put them back in you. And you know, it is remarkable. Anyone who's had this
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.800]   swears bite in terms of it cured all their, you know, aches and pains. Now, obviously,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.880]   it's it's all paid out of pocket as well. You know, the medical insurance doesn't cover this,
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.840]   but stem cell therapy is one of the big go tos on fixing things that are wrong with you.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.400]   And it can get, as you can just see up to $50,000 overall, you know, for, for getting those types
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.320]   of treatments and the average is around maybe 10,000, but you have to go more than once, right?
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.520]   But stem cell therapy is a great gift for Christmas for someone who suffers from aches and pains,
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.480]   and you just want to fix them. Now, the other thing that a lot of us do as biohackers is we
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.440]   take supplements. And the thing about supplements is it's definitely a ridiculously expensive bioact.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.000]   Now right here on the left side of the page is just simply my shortlist. I have two sets of
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.800]   vitamins that I take every day. One is I call my anti-aging and one is just my regular vitamins
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.560]   and minerals. My anti-aging stack that I take every day, I just ran the numbers. It based on,
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.720]   you know, today's costs, right, for all these different bottles of supplements, I spend about
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.200]   $2,000 a year right now just myself on anti-aging supplements and the most expensive one, obviously,
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.640]   is carbon 60. And then that does not even include what I spend on vitamins and minerals. You know,
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.800]   so it's just $2,000 a year, it can get quite expensive. But, you know, if you really want to
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.000]   make sure that you're replenishing your body with all of the stuff that you're no longer producing
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.080]   because you're getting older, you want to keep your brain going, you want to really kind of just
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.560]   really make sure you're doing all that stuff with senolytics, autophagy and all of that stuff to
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.360]   get rid of those zombie cells, then that's really kind of going to be the, you know, the benchmark
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.080]   here in terms of taking anti-aging supplements that are purely for that purpose. Now, also,
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.920]   I did mention senolytics. So, I'm sure you've been, there's a lot of advertisement lately
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.880]   on two specific biohacking, you know, supplements that I'm seeing everywhere I go on social media.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.840]   And one of them is the quality of company. I mean, they're even putting out, you know,
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.520]   YouTube ads that I'm seeing now. And if you take a look at the senolytic product from
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.880]   quality, they also sell different other products, but they're senolytic product.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.280]   Now, you only got to take six tablets twice a month, but you do that for a whole year,
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:46.240]   it's going to be $948. So, just that one supplement, one supplement for anti-aging,
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.200]   just for the specific purpose of senolytics, which is, you know, getting rid of your zombie cells,
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.400]   it's going to cost you, you know, $950 a year. And then the stem regen, I've been seeing ads
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.960]   like that. So, I took a look at that puppy. And, you know, the way that each one of those bottles
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:09.120]   only lasts a few days. So, you have to buy $2,268 worth of stem regen a year just to take
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.000]   it daily. So, to give you an idea, just this one supplement, which is by far, I mean,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.080]   based on all the science and everything about this one particular supplement,
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.120]   it helps your body produce stem cells, you know, thereby getting all the benefits. And,
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.120]   yes, it's definitely cheaper than, you know, five, four, five, you know, $50,000 a year for
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.280]   stem cell treatment treatment. But, you know, get, if you just want to take stem regen,
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.080]   just as a heads up, it's going to cost you about $2,300 a year. So, you know, all of this
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.080]   is ridiculously expensive. But, you know, it depends on it. You feel if it's worth it.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.400]   It makes a great gift. It really does, you know, if you just want to give the gift to health,
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.360]   then this is one idea for you. Now, the other thing you might want to consider is
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.400]   pulse electromagnetic field therapy, also known as PMF for anyone who's got aches and pains.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:59.760]   And they're an, if they're an athlete, if they work out, this is a tremendous modality in terms of
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:08.240]   helping your natural, I mean, your body's natural ability to kind of detox as well as stimulate and
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.880]   really kind of, it's great for recovery. And, you know, they even use it on horses, you know,
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.520]   from professional thoroughbreds in the racing industry. So, the idea about this one is that
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:24.000]   athletes and biohackers who invest their own PMF devices for home, you could look at anywhere
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.920]   from spending just for a basic, basic, really simple model to start around $2,500. And they can go
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.280]   well over $2,000, you know, for a more advanced clinical grade device. So, just to give you an
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.680]   idea, I've got this one right here. It's the PMF 8000. I originally bought it from my horse.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.840]   These things retail at $2,500. And I remember getting it for like $8,000 on sale years and years
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:53.040]   ago when I had a horse. But here's the PMT 100 or 120. This puppy retails around $25,000 and so
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:59.600]   forth. So, they do get expensive, but they are 100% effective for what you need it to do. And
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.680]   that is it's going to basically really, really, really help your body, stimulate your body,
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:08.240]   give you the electrons you need and so forth. Another really great gift idea for ridiculously
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.560]   expensive biohacks is something you might want to consider as a multi-wave oscillator.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.040]   Now, this is the thing. It's originally invented by a guy named Georges Likovsky with the concept of
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:23.920]   resonating, you know, electricity, creating an electrical field and then resonating frequencies
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.640]   between the antennas. Or in this model here, it just resonates out of the main antenna. But the
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:34.000]   idea here is that it basically tunes your cells. And this leads to an increase in efficiency and
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.320]   biological activities inside your body, such as cell regeneration and metabolic processes. Now,
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.880]   these multi-wave oscillators are quite effective. There's a long history of them. They, you know,
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:52.560]   they go back to the 1930s and they range anywhere from $16,000 to $25,000 based on model. But this
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:58.480]   is a great gift idea for someone in your life who you feel would this would be really helpful.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.440]   It's kind of like a tuning machine for your cells at the cellular level. Now, another idea here,
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:10.480]   number nine, is a scalar wave generator. These are also very, very effective biohacks and they've
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.960]   been known to do some incredible things as it relates to your health. So the idea here is that
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.320]   a scalar treatment device that it provides three different methods of transmitting healing scalar
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:26.080]   waves, either just pure scalar, molecular scalar, or rifescalar, which are resonant frequencies that
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:32.080]   can help with your cells. Somewhat like the multi-wave oscillator, but more in terms of specific
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.680]   resonant frequencies, it uses scalar energy fields to improve health by restoring cellular
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.400]   communication networks and enhancing metabolism and circulation. And these things, they do what
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.200]   they say they're going to do. The one on the right here is called energy or EE systems, energy
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:54.080]   something systems. And this puppy, they start at 28,000. They go as high as 25 or $250,000,
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.440]   depending on the size of the unit. So the base model on an EE systems is 28,000. Obviously,
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.080]   there are numerous clinics around the country that offer sessions to sit in just like on the
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.720]   the biocharger over here. They offer, you know, there's different clinics, like 3000 different
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.040]   clinics in the world. They offer sessions where you can go in there anywhere from 20 to whatever,
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:18.240]   80 bucks a session, I'm not sure. But same thing with here with the EE systems. You know,
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.160]   instead of you know, you could buy one for yourself or you could buy gifts cards for people who who
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.840]   have these devices and they can go and take treatments, but that's kind of humbug. And if
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.920]   you just want it in your house, this model right here is the spooky scalar model. And that starts at
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.880]   2500. And it gives you all of the different equipment that you need. And you just need to pop up the
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.400]   learning curve on how to use it. But a scalar wave generator is a great health tool for that
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.920]   biohacker in your life. Another last one, number 10, is the red light therapy. We've all heard of
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.800]   red light therapy. We've seen, I mean, there's just so much content on YouTube and everywhere
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.840]   else you look in the biohacker world on how incredibly great red light therapy is on wound
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:01.760]   healing on health. You name it. Okay, so the idea here now it just it doesn't just treat skin. So a
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:07.200]   lot of people just think, Oh, red light is just treats skin, but it also treats skin conditions,
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.920]   health conditions and so forth. And but the idea here on the red light therapy devices,
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.400]   it really depends on the type, the size and the quality. So I'm not again, I'm not talking about
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:22.560]   the cheap crap from China. I'm talking about quality produced with us, you know, engineers
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:28.080]   oversights on the devices that they're selling. So the quality of the device, as well as the
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.240]   provider in the location of the treatment. So again, you can go and get treatments. Okay,
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.760]   or you can just buy a red light lamp your house yourself. Now I'm not talking about the little
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.160]   ones that you hold in your hand. And you've seen tons and tons of, you know, like TikTok videos
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.080]   about women with their red light, you know, masks that they put over their face, which is great,
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.680]   by the way, for your complexion. Now those will run, you know, those kind of run anywhere in the
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.480]   low hundreds. But if you wanted to get an actual full body, you know, you just want to take a full
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:58.240]   body treatment and get a full dose of red light with a full body lamp, or in this case,
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:04.960]   a full body red light lamp or red light bed. These devices can cost up to 85,000. This model right
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:12.080]   here is $85,000 for red light for bed. You know, for a bed, I've seen them as low as 55,000 for a
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:19.040]   bed. But the lamps right here, they run around 800 to $1,000. I actually bought one for myself.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.600]   I bought one for my daughter for Christmas a couple of years ago. And so, and then we both use these
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:28.480]   as well in terms of, you know, for our health and for the red light therapy benefits that we can see.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.520]   Now if you can go to a clinic or you find someone that actually has these in their clinic, the cost
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:39.120]   per treatment ranges anywhere from $25 to 200 per session. I'm, you know, I'm thinking if you,
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.360]   if somebody had one of these beds, it'd probably be 200 a session. And again, you know, it's really
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:48.400]   not covered by insurance. But, you know, there you go. Just real quick and fast, I just wanted
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:55.040]   to give you 10 ridiculously expensive biohacks that you could consider. If money is not an option
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:59.280]   and you love someone really, really, really, really much, you know, a lot, and you would like to just
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:03.600]   help them move their health on their diet, then these are the 10 ideas for you to consider.
