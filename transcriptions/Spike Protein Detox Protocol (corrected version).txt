[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   Hey everybody, this is a repost of the Spike Protein Detox Protocol video.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.400]   I made a mistake in the actual quantities of the different supplements for the protocol
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400]   that I do apologize for that.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.280]   I've been tinkering around using AI tools and apparently the first thing out of the
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.640]   gate is you can't trust them to summarize anything correctly.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.080]   The first lesson learned was you really need to do your own homework and those tools are
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.880]   helpful, but don't rely on them.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.840]   Boy, that was stupid and I'm sorry.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.680]   I apologize for the error and so this is a corrected version so that I replaced the
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.360]   section in this video where I talk about the actual protocol itself and also corrected
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.360]   all the show notes.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.240]   So, again, I apologize for the incorrect information in the first video and so here you go for the
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.240]   original.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.120]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Takers Academy video.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.400]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.320]   And in this video, I'd like to share with you some pretty interesting news in the health
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.320]   front.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.040]   There's now been a Spike Protein Detox protocol.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.240]   That's the first time it's ever been published in a United States medical journal and so
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.600]   now this is somewhat big news because this is obviously one of the issues of our decade
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.000]   if you've been following the entire story of the vaccinations and COVID as in terms of
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.240]   long haul COVID.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.880]   So there's a lot of people suffering from this and this is the very first protocol that's
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.760]   actually made it through all the channels that need to be gone through in order to actually
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.800]   publish in a medical journal in the United States.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.080]   So it's a big deal for this story that's been developing since 2020.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.960]   So I wanted to share with you that first article that just came out, the research behind
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.720]   it and the protocol itself.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.480]   So come along, let's start and jump right in.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.960]   So the very first thing I want to do obviously is I do, I'm sorry, I have to do a disclaimer

[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.840]   If you're interested in reading the report yourself and or the associate research behind
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.840]   it, feel free.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.200]   It's all in the links.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   So there you go.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.880]   Now let me jump right into the actual article that came out.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.760]   Now this was published just a couple of weeks ago today is September 7th, 2023.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.440]   So within the last couple of weeks in the journal of American physicians and surgeons,
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.720]   the fall edition of 2023, an article was published called clinical rationale for SARS COVID-2
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.600]   based spike protein detoxification in post COVID-19 and vaccine injury syndromes.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.120]   Now this was published.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.400]   The doctors involved with this were Dr. Peter McCollough and Dr. Brian Proctor.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.520]   And I believe another doctor, Kate Nguyen, but there's no little initials after this person's
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520]   name.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.520]   So I'm not quite sure.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.280]   However, this article was published in a medical journal, a big deal here and specifically
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.080]   on how to detox from this spike protein, which as many of you who follow this news, you may
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.520]   realize that the whole thing behind that is all the M R N A stuff.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.640]   And now that's been put in all sorts of different vaccines.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.960]   So this is not going to go away, even if COVID goes away.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.320]   So I just, you know, wanted to point that out.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.400]   So this paper simply puts together and of course, you know, if you want to read it, there's
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.640]   a link, but I just want to do a quick summary as quick as I can, basically, you know, highlighting
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.680]   the, you know, the big points of the paper and bottom line was, you know, the paper covers
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.840]   the idea of what's been going on that most people who have contracted COVID-19 or taken
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.360]   one of the many COVID-19 vaccines have been exposed to the injurious cars, SARS COVID-2
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.880]   spike protein, which is what they designed that whole vaccine around.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.520]   And so the immunity handles the infection, defends the body against systemic illness.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.720]   That's the whole point behind, you know, this is what our bodies do.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.800]   However, they created this vaccine, you know, and certain people are having issues with
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   it.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.080]   So that's kind of what they cover in their paper that the vaccines deliver the genetic
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.800]   code for the spike protein, which is how they want, you know, they wanted to fight fire
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   with fire, right?
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.640]   And the spike protein is associated with post COVID-19 syndrome, from symptoms.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.660]   Sorry, particularly myocarditis in children and young adults.
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.360]   So some side effects, surprise, surprise.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.640]   So you know, it's just how this is going, right?
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.200]   So now you've not, you've got not only you have problems with people with COVID and there's
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.600]   a lot of people out there with long COVID because of the spike protein issue, but then
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.880]   when they went to go fight it, you know, they created new issues right with this vaccine.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.280]   And as the spike protein is responsible for the pathogenicity of the SARS COVID-2 infection
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.700]   and drives the development of adverse events, injuries, disabilities and death after vaccination
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.760]   through immunologic and thrombotic mechanisms.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.560]   So that's the fancy way of saying, Hey, you know what, there are people that are vaccine
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   injured.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.320]   There are people who are along COVID injured.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:59.120]   And this is really just kind of the bad, a bad situation for humanity in general.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.920]   And it's not going away anytime soon.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.480]   So what these doctors did, you know, with this understanding, basically they put together
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.040]   a protocol.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.320]   Now the protocol is supported with research done by other scientists and I want to walk
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.320]   you through it.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.760]   And it breaks down into simply three natural substances.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.320]   You can go and buy it any, any place that cell supplements.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.220]   You can buy these substances and they put together the protocol based on the research
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:33.480]   of the supplement effect on the SARS COVID-2 virus.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.000]   And so they put all of this research together and put together this protocol.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.220]   And that's what this paper basically is.
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:46.140]   It's the protocol of these different research projects that had gone on with regard specifically
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:52.320]   to what types of natural substances in our environment, you know, can help your body mitigate
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.320]   the effect of these spike proteins that are really hurting people.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.880]   And so one of the first ones, the papers, that support, okay, see these are studies that
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:08.460]   support the paper that Dr. McAuliffe and Dr. Proctor wrote, okay, in the journal.
[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.580]   And so I just want to point out that there are some, you know, this is actual hard science
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.780]   that supports the article.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:18.180]   It's not just a couple of doctors came up with an idea that it's all tied together.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.960]   There's research papers published in the medical literature.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.520]   And then of course these guys wrote an article that got approved for the journal.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.720]   So now that one of the first things that I want to point out is if there's three main
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.000]   components and substances that these guys, these two doctors put together as their protocol
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.840]   and one of them is called Nara Tenasi.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.880]   And basically what that is, it's a derivative of soybeans.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.700]   But here's the study here in the National Center for Biological Information, the NCBI
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:55.860]   directory, and the study for this particular substance is called the Degradative Effect
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:01.020]   of Nara Tenasi on Spike Protein of SARS-COVID-2, version two.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.940]   And so bottom line, if you read the abstract, you read this study, okay, the studies, I'll
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.740]   just, I just plucked a little bit out of the abstract.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.060]   Basically it says the immunofluorescence analysis showed that the spike protein on the cell
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:19.020]   surface was degraded when Nara Tenasi was added to the culture medium, okay, thus our
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:24.220]   finding suggests that Nara Tenasi exhibits potential for the inhibition of SARS-COVID-2
[00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.860]   infection via spike protein degradation.
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.380]   So there's definitely been a study that says, hey, you know what, Nara Tenasi works against
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.380]   this stuff.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:38.220]   Okay, now the other study that was what was supporting the journal paper was a study that's
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:44.780]   also been published in the National Center for Biological Information, Biotechnology Information.
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:52.060]   And this paper is called the Bromelane Inhibits SARS-COVID-2 infection in Vero-E6 cells, okay.
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.860]   And so from that abstract, this discovery for these scientists had found out, these are
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.460]   all independent scientists out there in the world, so they're not all working together.
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.940]   These are all different scientists and different doctors and so forth.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.860]   So but this, these scientists discovered that Bromelane, so they, this is right out of their
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.700]   abstract, basically a summary of the results, it says, we demonstrate that Bromelane isolated
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.660]   for the pineapple stem uses a dietary supplement.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:23.940]   Treatment diminishes the expression of ACE2 and TMPR-SS2 in Vero-E6 cells and dramatically
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:30.980]   lowers the expression of S ectodomane domain, importantly, okay, Bromelane treatment reduced
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.820]   the interaction between S ectodomane and Vero-E6 cells.
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:41.740]   That's scientists were saying it affected the spike protein's ability to infect the cell,
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:47.980]   most importantly though, in Bromelane treatment significantly diminished the SARS-COVID-2 infection
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:54.660]   in these Vero-E6 cells altogether, our results suggest that Bromelane or Bromelane rich pineapple
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.620]   stem may be used in an antiviral against COVID-19.
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.060]   So you know, this is also again, this is a study that supports Bromelane.
[00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:08.940]   Now the third substance in the journal paper that the two doctors put together for a detox
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.940]   is curcumin.
[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:14.980]   Now for those of you know, curcumin is an extract of turmeric.
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.860]   And so this paper is published in Science Direct, and it's titled, "Curcumin inhibits
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:25.240]   spike protein of New SARS-COVID-2 variant of concern, omicron, and in silico study."
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.980]   Okay, it's an in silico study.
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:32.380]   So the results were that these scientists discovered that curcumin among seven phytochemicals
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:38.460]   was found to have the most substantial inhibitory potential with omicron spike protein.
[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:43.660]   Further, it was found that curcumin could disrupt the omicron as ACE2 complex.
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:48.180]   The molecular dynamic stimulation or simulation, sorry, demonstrated that curcumin could form
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:53.020]   a stable structure with omicron spike in the physiological environment.
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:58.180]   So the conclusion of these scientists was to conclude that curcumin can be considered
[00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:04.580]   as a potential therapeutic agent against the highly infectious omicron variant of SARS-COVID-2.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:10.060]   All right, so there you go, you've got scientific studies that support three separate substances
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:15.780]   that are all really, really, really helpful as a treatment for spike protein issues,
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.060]   which is both COVID and vaccine injury.
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.660]   So now going back to the paper, I kind of want to highlight some of the things that
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.740]   the paper said that a lot of folks don't read the whole thing.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:28.500]   So I just want to highlight a couple of things that you should be aware of.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:34.540]   Now if you know someone or you yourself have long haul COVID or you've got COVID or just
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:40.140]   regular COVID or, you know, you've had some issues with the vaccine after receiving them,
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:44.340]   after receiving the boosters and so forth, going back to the paper by Dr. McAuliffe and
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:48.780]   Dr. Proctor, I just want to stipulate there's some things that I think are very important
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.380]   here to share.
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.620]   Now their conclusion in their paper that was published in the journal, it says, you know,
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.900]   conclusion, no therapeutic claims can be made until a large prospective randomized double
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.940]   blind plus, double controlled trials are completed.
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:11.020]   However, a triad of Nino Canassie, Bromelain and Nino Kirkman is a reasonable empiric
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:18.100]   strategy for those suffering with post COVID-19 or vaccine associated symptoms.
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:24.860]   Chronic disabling from long COVID and following mRNA injections are an increasingly prevalent
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:31.360]   problem and Nino Canassie, Bromelain and Kirkman should be considered as treatment.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.820]   So again, you know, this is in a very important point is that all of those studies were all
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:44.300]   done in a lab and there have been no long-term human studies as much as there's been any
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.020]   long-term human studies of the vaccines, right?
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.780]   So the whole idea here though is that, you know, hey, where they found these things at
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:55.420]   work, they, you know, and everything about them is, you know, should be considered as
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.420]   the treatment.
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.380]   However, be aware, you know, all of this is just coming up, small, brand new, paper just
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:06.060]   came out a couple of weeks ago, all of this is new, so there has been no long-term human's
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:12.940]   trials but it's being highly recommended by Dr. McAuliffe and Dr. Proctor as a protocol
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:20.180]   when you combine these three things, you know, that it will most likely help, okay.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:25.060]   Now the other thing in the paper that I really want to point out to about some of these things
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:29.900]   that you should be aware of is Nino Canassie, you know, you know, it bottom line, it comes
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.660]   from, you know, soy, soybeans, it's fermented soybean thing.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.420]   But the thing about it though is even though it effectively stops SARS-CoV-2 and bovine
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:43.700]   herpes, virus type 1 infections in human cells in culture, right, and the protolift
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.660]   effect of Nino Canassie was heat sensitive.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.420]   So a couple of things here and the paper also stipulates that however, the risk of bleeding
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:57.780]   must be considered when using Nino Canassie with concurrent anti-palate platelet and anti-quagulant
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.020]   drugs, okay.
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.740]   So there's like these little sentences in the journal paper that people might not pick
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.540]   up on but you need to be aware.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.780]   If you're on blood thinners, don't take this, period, okay.
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.460]   Just or consult with your doctor but, you know, bottom line is that you don't want
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.360]   to be taking Nino Canassie if you're on blood thinners and that's what this one sentence
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.940]   translates to, okay.
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:23.140]   It might work really well with SARS but you don't want to compound your problems, all
[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.140]   right.
[00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.400]   So just heads up on that one.
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.420]   The other one that I want to give everybody heads up on that bromelane as noted is, you
[00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.980]   know, it's basically it's been, it's isolated from a pineapple stem.
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:38.060]   It's been used as an anti-inflammatory and healing effects causing arthritis and injury
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:42.540]   has been approved in Europe for, you know, and even for burn wounds, you know, and it's
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.540]   used for that.
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.620]   It's actually enough, it's actually used as a drug too, you know, and so, but the idea
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.420]   about bromelane though that I wanted to point out something from the paper that you may
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:57.180]   not have caught is that bromelane can increase bleeding risk, cause gastrointestinal upset
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:02.580]   and increase the absorptions and increase the absorptions of medications including antibiotics,
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:09.140]   chemotherapy, butic agents, ACE inhibitors, benzodiazepines, certain antidepressants,
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.700]   opioids and barbiturates, okay.
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.460]   So when it says it can increase the absorption of that, then, you know, the caution here
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:21.900]   is taking bromelane, again, if you're on blood dinners, and then also too, if you're
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:26.180]   on other one of these, any types of these types of medications, it's a caution that
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:31.260]   you would be taking bromelane, obviously talk to your physician if you're on these drugs.
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.900]   So b, just a heads up, wanted to make sure when it's real clear on some of the cautions
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.820]   here that are in the paper that you may not have caught.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.220]   The other thing about now is the third one is curcumin.
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:48.620]   Carcumin, again, is a polyphenol that's derived from turmeric, okay, and of course, you know,
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:54.060]   the papers show that it's, it prevents the entry of the SARS-2 into cells by blocking
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.620]   the spike protein sites, binding sites on your cells.
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.060]   So it's been found to do that in the lab.
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.780]   However, one of the other things about curcumin, though, is it's a spice.
[00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:07.580]   It's also been shown to reduce inflammatory marking markers in the settings of COVID
[00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.580]   spike protein, mediated infection and injury.
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:16.340]   It can be taken as an oral supplement, and this is the key, but may decrease the effectiveness
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:21.020]   of prescription hormones, thyroid, and estradiol, okay.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:25.700]   So there, again, there's another caution, wanted to make sure that you caught that in
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.700]   the paper.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.460]   So for those of you who are looking at, you know, any kind of relief from whatever you're
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:36.140]   going through or your loved ones, and you want to go ahead and do this, please be aware
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.860]   of the cautions, please be aware of the conclusions, and just, you know, and walk into this, you
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:47.180]   know, with, you know, just awareness of the things that may not work out if you have any
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:48.440]   of these kinds of situations.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.780]   So I just want to be real clear about that.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:55.500]   And so that's the summary of the protocol is to say, hey, you know what, we got three,
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.500]   we found three things that work really well.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.500]   Let's put them together.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.500]   Okay.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:06.220]   So now I went through the paper and I accurately, this time, sorry, this is reposting here, about
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.780]   the actual protocol itself.
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:12.060]   And so I just wanted to kind of stipulate this is exactly what you would need to do according
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:19.100]   to Dr. McAuliffe and Proctor, in terms of how to detox those spike proteins out of your
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.100]   body.
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:25.340]   And again, you know, this is for both COVID, long haul COVID, and also the vaccine injury
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.420]   type of symptoms.
[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:34.940]   So the whole thing comes down to the three different substances, so nato kenase.
[00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:41.780]   You would want to take 2,000 FU and that FU stands for fibrin units twice a day.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.740]   You would want to take bromolane along with this, you'd take bromolane, 500 milligrams
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.660]   per day, and curcumin, 500 milligrams twice per day.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.660]   Okay.
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:54.860]   Now you do that for a whole 90 days, and that's the protocol the doctors are recommending
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.340]   in the journal article.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.660]   So now I did some Amazon math for everybody, which is kind of make it simple for you guys.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:06.260]   I go through Amazon and just like you, you know, pick the highest rated number of stars,
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.940]   four and a half or above, and with the lowest price.
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.900]   And so I kind of like decided, hey, if I was going to do this for myself, then let me go
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.500]   ahead and show you guys what I would do.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.300]   And then, you know, what the cost is really to do the protocol.
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:24.180]   So now if I picked out these three different products for that reason, right, high, high
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:28.060]   review count, low price, lowest price for the highest stars.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:34.900]   And so now they all come in different quantities in terms of, you know, the amount of, you
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:39.860]   know, the substance within the each capsule and the number of tablets within each bottle.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:44.420]   So the whole idea here though is if you buy this one particular brand, links in the video
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.420]   description.
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:51.300]   You know, they don't want bottle at two times a day, will last you 60 days, right, so 120
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.300]   in there.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.860]   Same with the Kirkham in itself.
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.840]   So you would want to go ahead and you need, you know, for 90 days, you'd need at least
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   two of these.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.420]   So you'd want to buy two of those for, you know, for it last you longer than the 90 days,
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.900]   but you'd have enough for the whole 90 day protocol.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.900]   Okay.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.460]   And then that thing about not a connoisseur, you want to point out that a little unique
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:17.420]   is that this type of substance is measured in these fibrin units in terms of its potency.
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.980]   Not to be confused with milligrams.
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:19.980]   Okay.
[00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.940]   And that's kind of what screwed me up the first time around.
[00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:28.540]   And so you would want to get the not a connoisseur 2000 FU and that's what's going to be the
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:34.460]   correct type of not a connoisseur, the Tef, correct potency for the protocol.
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:39.620]   So bromelain is pretty straightforward, it's just, you know, buy a bottle and you know
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:44.380]   if you just buy one bottle, it's super cheap, 120 in one, you just take 500 milligrams per
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:47.700]   day, right, along with the other two substances.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.140]   So one bottle last 120 days, perfect for the protocol.
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.340]   Now with Kirkham and I do want to point out, you know, I buy this, I've been buying this
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.780]   and taking this daily for over a while over a decade.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.980]   And so the thing about Kirkham and that you should be aware of when you're out shopping
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:06.020]   for it is that it's a derivative or it's an extract of turmeric.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.020]   Okay.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:11.500]   So it takes a bunch of turmeric to make a little bit of Kirkham and so what you'll find that
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.980]   if you go on Amazon, you'll find a bunch of when you like Google or search for Kirkham
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:21.060]   and you're going to find products that are called turmeric Kirkham and I just want to
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:25.980]   point out that that is not the same as actual Kirkham and so you need to look at the ingredients
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:31.380]   and if it says turmeric and they're calling their product turmeric Kirkham and it basically
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.340]   means that it's got a whole bunch of cheap turmeric in it and a little bit of the expensive
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:40.620]   Kirkham in it and so, you know, it's not going to be what you need for the protocol.
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:45.420]   So for the protocol itself, it is a product that I recommend and I take myself which is
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.940]   Kirkham and 95 from Jarl Formulas and it's all Kirkham and you look at the ingredients
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:55.140]   it says Kirkham and right or it says turmeric extract, it doesn't say turmeric.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.140]   So you got to be real careful about the, you know, the kind of the monkey around the words
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.940]   on you and they will sell you a turmeric making you think that it's Kirkham and it's not.
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:10.100]   This is all Kirkham and from Jarl Formulas, one bottle, 120 days, you take it twice a
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:14.380]   day, it's going to be 60 days for one bottle so you need to buy two to get through the
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.860]   protocol and so make sure you buy two of those and make sure you buy actual Kirkham.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.860]   All right.
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:24.100]   So now if you go on Amazon today and you buy these three products just to make it simple
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.300]   for you and save you some time, if you buy two and one and two of these, it's going to
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.940]   come out to about $102.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:36.340]   So for $102, you know, that's a pretty inexpensive way to detox, you know, these things out of
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:40.140]   your body, help people that you know are injured and stuff like that.
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:45.740]   So way lower than my first, you know, analysis and I'm, again, I'm sorry for the incorrect
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.580]   information in the first video.
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.660]   That's why this is coming out and I want to make sure it's accurate and that I do correct
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.660]   my mistakes.
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:57.900]   So hey, this is what you would do, $102, do the protocol and help yourself feel better
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:03.700]   according to Dr. Proctor and Dr. McCollum and all the research that stands behind it.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:04.700]   So there you go.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:09.100]   Now I also want to just say thanks for watching the video, I really appreciate your patronage.
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:13.500]   You can find me and all the other stuff that I do at Tinkers.academy, you just type that
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.860]   in your URL window and that takes you to my blog and also to, you know, if you found
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.860]   this information helpful, educational and so forth, that's the type of content that I
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:22.860]   do put out.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:27.140]   So I'd appreciate if you'd like and subscribe to the videos and to my channel and that helps
