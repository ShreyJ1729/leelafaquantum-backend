[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.720]   I'm your host Kay Elmer and today we are and I've got Phillip on the line and he's going
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:18.120]   to be sharing the results of the pain management frequency contest and we're really excited
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.700]   about who won, how it's going to work out and the new frequencies coming out.
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.240]   So I have got Phillip on the line.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.760]   He's the founder of the Layla Quantum Deck.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.480]   If you don't already know, good morning, Phillip, how are you today?
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.480]   I'm great.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.840]   Thank you for having me on.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.920]   Yeah, I'm really excited.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:42.600]   I submitted my contest entry back in February or March, so it's been a while and just very
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.600]   eager to find out.
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.480]   I know everyone else is too as well as what happens.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.920]   So let's go ahead and just I'll just let you run with it.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.040]   I know everyone's excited to hear what happened and the discovery that you guys made that
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.080]   you mentioned in your interview with Luke's story the other day, I just watched that last
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.200]   night and that was a great interview, but yeah, you mentioned it.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.840]   So let's go ahead and talk about that.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.680]   So let me just before we get into the detail here, everybody, just the standard disclaimer,
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.840]   neither quantum upgrade or Layla Quantum Tech nor the Tinkers Academy recommend or endorse
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.160]   any specific test physicians, procedures, opinions or other information that may be mentioned
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.600]   in this video, reliance on any information appearing and discussing this video is solely
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.440]   at everyone's own risks.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.360]   Statements made have not been evaluated by the EFSA or FDA or any governmental derivatives
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.520]   thereof.
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.160]   Quantum upgrade and Layla Quantum Tech products may represent or it's products that quantum
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.520]   upgrade and Layla Quantum Tech may represent or not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.520]   any disease.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.960]   So keep in mind everyone that these frequencies are very unique in terms of what they do.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.320]   And then there, you know, and that there is a governmental oversight on health companies
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.280]   being able to openly, you know, talk about what they do.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.040]   And so, you know, I just wanted to kind of stipulate that it's kind of a difficult kind
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.040]   of topic to discuss today, but we'll go ahead and just give that a shot in terms of what
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.200]   the frequencies are able to do and what they've been shown to do.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.120]   And what's even more cool is that there's been a couple of basis studies already done
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.120]   on these.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.600]   So we'll get into that later, too.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   All right.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   So, Phillip, this is the big moment you had this, it was called the molecular pain management
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.000]   frequency contest.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.760]   You announced it a few months ago, people sent in a bunch of submissions and say, hey,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760]   what happened?
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.280]   So what happened from there?
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.160]   So first of all, sorry to everyone that it's taken so long.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.560]   It was a longer process actually to get all the frequencies and we obviously had frequencies
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.480]   from all over the world sent in, actually, and a bunch of those from Europe.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.200]   And then we just had to wait until everything also was shipped.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.480]   We had some shipping delays.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.080]   And then on top of that afterwards, I was just so crazy busy and we had some other things
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.840]   and we had actually a lot of frequencies to go through.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.940]   That was also something that we didn't just want to go through like click, click, click,
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.840]   but we wanted to really be very thorough and thank you to everyone that participated because
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.920]   this was just absolutely amazing.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.040]   There was so much good energy and amazing frequencies, amazing ideas that people had,
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.280]   you know, people send in also their their sheets, what they put in the frequencies and
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.160]   it was just amazing.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:48.080]   And yeah, so we actually arrived at, it was basically three winner frequencies that we
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.440]   had and it was number one, number two, number three.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:00.160]   And then we realized, wow, if you put these three together, this is amazing.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.760]   Like it beat any, any single one of those by far and large, it was just amazing to put
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.360]   these three together.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.960]   And then we had one last one where we didn't even think another winner could come because
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.560]   it was phenomenal already.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.160]   And then that frequency ended up for the pain management that we were looking for to be
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.160]   the winners.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.920]   So then we were like, wow, this is crazy.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.240]   We already had this amazing frequency and now there's the winners.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:38.480]   So then we decided to have more than one winner because both frequencies are absolutely amazing.
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:46.360]   And the number one winner, I can announce her name real quick, give me one second.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.120]   I'm just glad it is Sarah Becker.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.120]   Congratulations Sarah.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.120]   So amazing job.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:05.560]   She is from Germany and yeah, absolutely amazing frequency for pain management.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:13.720]   And then we have basic, and so she will get this amazing grand block, which is not publicly
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.720]   available.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.320]   I think we will make it available at some point.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.800]   It's just absolutely massive.
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.400]   It has new features.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.440]   It has, it is by far and large, the most powerful block we've ever created.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.600]   And that was the price, right?
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.760]   You know, we told people that would be the price.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:40.060]   But these other three people that I'll mention right now, they will also get it.
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.760]   Because frankly, that frequency, yeah.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.400]   So that frequency was also phenomenal.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.920]   And we called that one.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.640]   So the first one will actually be called pain reconciliation frequency.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.640]   Okay.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.760]   So we can't cannot call it pain management just for regulatory purposes.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.840]   So we will call it pain reconciliation.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.560]   And the other one will be called heel 360.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.200]   And why is that?
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.600]   Because it actually, while it also helps with the pain, let's call it reconciliation, it
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:23.840]   actually stimulates healing on, I mean, you can say from this physical level on all levels,
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.840]   right?
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:31.560]   And it stimulates that on a physical level, on an energetic level, on an emotional and
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.000]   mental level.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.920]   And it's a wonderful frequency, absolutely.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.680]   We were blown away and by putting all these three together, frankly, right?
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.440]   So we did some tinkering on our end also, right, to even make that happen after this.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.600]   But really amazing.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.840]   So we had, who's this here?
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.760]   Oh, no, a pyramid of Santa.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.360]   If that's written correctly, maybe it's the other way around, we can't tell.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.480]   It could be, yeah, I think it's actually the other way around.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.120]   So Oksana Pierman, so it seems to be a lady, Oksana Pierman.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:19.520]   And yeah, she's actually, so this is a whole group of people there in the same city in
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.520]   Germany.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.120]   I think, I don't know, like how many different people participated, they, they're a group
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:33.200]   of tinkerers, apparently, that in these groups, they meet up and create frequencies all the
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.440]   time.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:40.360]   And I mean, a lot of those actually did not win, but yeah, there were several here that
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.520]   were absolutely amazing.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:49.160]   So she is one of those, then the other one for this basically second place of frequency
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.760]   is Lydia Bischoff, also from the same city.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:01.160]   And then the third one is from the U.S. and probably most people know him in the group.
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.200]   His name is El Neumann.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.920]   Hey, okay.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:15.240]   So El, I think he, so he's the one that actually put together also like a huge tutorial about
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.320]   Lydia products and he's been in the group for a long time.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.520]   And yeah, that frequency was also amazing and it was so wonderful to see, to put them
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.200]   all together, what came out of it.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:32.520]   And again, I must emphasize, so usually that it's not necessarily the case, right?
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:38.360]   For example, we also tested what if we put these together with the first one and that
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.240]   went with with Sarah's frequency and that didn't work at all, right?
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.960]   It's not a frequency you, you combine it just isn't a good outcome.
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.240]   So yeah, so this is it.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.040]   And these two frequencies were really looking forward to it.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.040]   I'm happy to go into more details.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.360]   I will announce this on Telegram at some point today.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.680]   And yeah, then we'll go from there.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.680]   Okay.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.680]   Well, that's great.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.680]   Okay.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.680]   So just a couple of questions.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.120]   So congratulations to all of the four winners, you know, kudos.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.840]   That's fantastic strong, strong presence from the German group.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.200]   So hey, kudos to you guys.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.200]   Okay.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.920]   So I'm just curious, like how many total submissions did you get for the contest?
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:31.520]   I think we had about 70 60 something, something along those lines.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.520]   Okay.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.700]   So then, so then Sarah won just on her own, right?
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.360]   And that's the one that you're calling pain reconciliation management.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.680]   Is this pain, just pain reconciliation.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.560]   And that was Sarah's, right?
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.400]   And, and that's, and so now what would, so I guess, so just to clarify for everybody.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:57.800]   So the singular frequency set that Sarah submitted is now called the pain reconciliation
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.480]   management frequency.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:04.040]   And this guy does, I mean, I just want to make sure we got the descriptions clear.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.320]   So you gave an earlier description.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.360]   And I think that was for the heel 360.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:14.200]   But how would you describe this one as, you know, a specific to like, why are they different
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.840]   and what makes this one different than the other one?
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:25.440]   And so this one is really what it was originally intended for, for, for, for pain, mainly on
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.240]   the physical level.
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.840]   So it, it helps with that.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:36.820]   And I need to be very careful what I say, because you know that the truth is reserved
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.320]   for the FDA.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.280]   And so we want to be really mindful of that.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.480]   And so that's what it helps with.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.720]   And at the same time, it helps you to open up.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:59.640]   So usually when you get in pain, you start to completely contract, which then actually
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.280]   can make it a lot worse.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:09.840]   And this one helps to ease it.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.280]   And it helps you to really open up your energy system at the same time.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:21.520]   So and it is really for that reason, if you have any type of pain coming up, this from
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:27.400]   our perspective is a really good choice to support you.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:34.000]   Of course, if you have like huge pain, you know, talk to your physician and all of that,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   right?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Okay.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   So this one's okay.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Go ahead.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Sorry.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.560]   That's a great frequency for that.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:52.280]   And then the heal 360 is, it goes way further than just regarding pain way, way further.
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:12:00.520]   It literally, it stimulates, I can't, I don't really say healing process, right?
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:07.640]   So I'm not really saying it, but on all different levels that we could measure it on a physical,
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:14.200]   energetic, mental, emotional, it is very soft energy.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.840]   It lifts you up.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.200]   I mean, it's just, I mean, we were blown away.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:25.040]   It wasn't necessarily the, you know, if you have knee pain, that's, it's also nice and
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.200]   it's also great.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.560]   It's phenomenal.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.360]   But then, you know, if you have knee pain, I would suggest Sarah's.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.120]   But this one here is one you, ah, you can, you can use in any situation actually.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.120]   Okay.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.120]   Okay.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.120]   Okay.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.120]   So that's the, okay.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.120]   That, I was wondering like, what's the difference?
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:48.520]   So one is more of a physical and then the other one is more of like, ah, just the, you
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:54.360]   know, like, I guess, oh, encompassing, like, you know, you could have, well, pain from
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.160]   just grief and loss, right?
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.000]   Is that kind of what you're meaning?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.160]   But the heal 360 really isn't just about pain.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.400]   It's about, it's literally about healing.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.400]   Healing.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.400]   Okay.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.440]   I mean, so it's a huge difference between the two frequencies.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.440]   All right.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.440]   And so how does the heal 360 compare to the current heal frequency?
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.520]   I guess it's called the primal healing frequency, right?
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.520]   Yep.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.580]   How do those two then compare?
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.580]   Yep.
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:31.360]   Well, it's this, this one here goes even further, ah, from our perspective.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:38.880]   It works on, because it works on even more levels, including the physical level.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.520]   And, and both are amazing, but this is, it's just a different angle.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.520]   It's just a different angle.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.040]   It feels a little bit different.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.560]   It feels very uplifting.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:56.200]   Also in the, in the usual heal frequency, we have the vitamins and the minerals included
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   also, right?
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.200]   Right.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.320]   You can see it's not included here, and it doesn't need to be included, frankly.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:09.560]   This is very, very complete and, and we will certainly list what is all included.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.040]   It's, I mean, it's a bunch, right?
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.120]   There's so much in there.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.080]   There's also vitamins and minerals in there, but it's different kinds.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:22.160]   I couldn't even list it all now because we, yeah, we will need to get into this and get
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:28.160]   it all written down because it's from three different people that all, right?
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.880]   All had their own like distinct approach to, to this, right?
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.080]   I mean, I mean, we saw everything, right?
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:42.960]   People, people tried a whole bunch and yeah, so we'll have to put it all together to actually
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.960]   list it.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.960]   Okay.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.960]   No, that's so cool.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.960]   Um, okay.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.880]   So then how are these going to be made available?
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:55.200]   Like, are they both going to come out as cards and on quantum upgrade or just cards for
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.200]   now?
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.800]   Which, what's the point now actually just quantum upgrade?
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.760]   Oh, on, they're going to be on upgrade.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:01.760]   Okay.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.280]   Yeah, because that's the fastest way to get it in.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:10.800]   Like we already implemented it into the system now that was yesterday and now we're working
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.280]   on the descriptions.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:17.160]   We're working on actually having it available on the web.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.160]   Okay.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.160]   That's cool.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:20.160]   Okay.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.160]   No, that's great.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.160]   And that, that people can select it.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.160]   Right.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.760]   That's what we're working on currently.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:35.960]   And then the next step will be okay to create mandalas also for this and then to make frequency
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:42.720]   cards, possibly even capsules regarding this or yeah, something like that.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.720]   Okay.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   No, that's okay.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:51.000]   So then when can people expect to have these available on quantum upgrade?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:58.760]   I'm expecting this to be at the very latest this following Tuesday, the 18th and it may
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.680]   be earlier, but yeah, I don't think later than the 18th.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.680]   Oh, cool.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.080]   Are they going to be added to any of the existing bundles or are they going to be like
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.440]   a separate thing like the animal one?
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:18.920]   No, so both of these will be going to the heel bundle just because it just makes sense.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:24.680]   You know, if it just, that's where it falls under and they will also both be added to
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.160]   the all in one frequency bundle.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:33.040]   And as usual, you know, the all in one frequency bundle or the heel bundle will be more expensive.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.520]   It's just going to be added.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.000]   You know, it's just an added value to people.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Okay.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   No, that sounds great.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.120]   I'm really looking forward to trying it next week.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.040]   This is just amazing.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.040]   So that's great.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.640]   Let me just kind of go back to the other, if I had any other questions.
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:52.720]   So the way you had it structured, the contest was that the winners would get that new super
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.720]   grand block.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:17:01.080]   That's brand new and that there would be like the runner ups would get infinity and travel
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.080]   blocks.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.080]   So you just changed it now.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:08.920]   I just want to clarify so that there's four winners and they all got the new, I guess,
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:16.880]   the new grand block is that because we felt it's such a, I mean, technically we could
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.960]   just say, well, you guys just now get a travel block or, you know, something like that.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:30.520]   But no, as they all receive the, the, the grand block.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.520]   Okay.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.520]   Cool.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.520]   The new one.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.080]   And then there's any idea like when, when, because when those will go out, I know that
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.320]   you're working on it.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.760]   And you were basically saying that in your original post, you're like, that you haven't,
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:48.260]   you know, it's not ready for like release on the website or anything and possibly by
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.260]   the end of the year.
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.680]   So around when do you think those will go out?
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.240]   Those will go out.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:01.720]   I'm thinking in July, okay, the beginning of July and then later this year, they'll be
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.720]   up for sale for people that are interested in this new block.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   Yes.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720]   Most likely.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.720]   Okay.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.560]   It's, these are not so easy to produce.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:18.080]   That's why I'm a little hesitant on saying, yeah, definitely at that time.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.600]   But yeah, we're, we're going to work on it and try to make it a little as fast as possible.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600]   Oh, no, that's great.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.720]   I'm just trying to ask questions that I know are going to come up with everyone, you know,
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.720]   being around the group so long, I know the questions that they're going to ask.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.720]   All right.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.720]   Great.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.360]   So one other thing I want to kind of make sure I bring, I bring up is that you had these
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.240]   two new frequencies.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:45.400]   Can I say something else because there's a, technically there was a fifth price also,
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.400]   right?
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.400]   Oh, okay.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.280]   And so there's basically a travel block that would go to someone.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:56.080]   But we, we really didn't have a fifth, you know, where we could say, okay, well, this
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.040]   would have been like the, the next one.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:06.200]   So what we, what we want to do is now just do like a raffle of all the ones that, that
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:13.860]   entered, you know, participated and, you know, we'll just draw a winner for this travel
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:14.860]   block.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:15.860]   Oh, okay.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.860]   That's cool.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:17.860]   That's cool.
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.860]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:19.860]   Thank you for that.
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:20.860]   And, you know, just again, congratulations to the winners.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.960]   This is amazing.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.120]   And what I did want to point out, Phillip, and I just wanted to, if you could comment
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:30.520]   on it was that you didn't just work with Roman and, and, and, you know, kind of tinker
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:35.040]   with this and come up with all of this and analyze the submissions, but you also submitted
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.580]   it to Bessa.
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.520]   And I want to let everybody know about that.
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:44.260]   And crew, I want to mention, and crew, like crew, Roman and I were heavily on this here.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:49.420]   And yeah, I mean, crew actually had a major part and, you know, we spent a lot of time
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.500]   going through this and it was fun.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.840]   But it's, it's, you know, we really took the time to do it.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.840]   No, that's great.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.800]   And so I just wanted to point out to everybody that both of these new frequencies were actually
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:08.840]   also given to the Bessa Institute to evaluate and that there's two new studies now on one
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.360]   on the, on Sarah, I would just call it Sarah's frequency.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.860]   And also the heal 360 and, and I think that if, you know, if you don't mind, folks, can
[00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.760]   you just kind of talk about these two studies and what Bessa discovered when they took a
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.200]   look at these two new frequencies?
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.200]   I hope, I hope you can fill me and because I actually, I sent you this.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.280]   I haven't even been able to, to get through them.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.200]   Literally, I have not been able to.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:42.560]   All I know is that both of them do exactly what we saw energetically and that the Bessa
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:49.120]   Institute was able to basically see the same thing, you know, because we had to tell them,
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.560]   okay, what, what the frequency does.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.760]   And then they basically stress tested and, and see is that the same results that they
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.640]   are getting. So it was overall extremely positive.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:08.160]   They said to me, at least over the phone, amazing frequencies.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.680]   And that's about all I know, because we try to get this in and I read it.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.880]   Yeah, this is happening here really quickly. Oh, okay, no worries, because I was trying
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.080]   to read through these myself. I wasn't sure if you, you know, because normally you get
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:23.400]   that debrief from Wolfgang and, but yeah, I actually read through this myself and I
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.600]   want everybody out there to know that it just wasn't, you know, like the healing network.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.880]   It was also Bessa and so these were thoroughly vetted.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.840]   And if you just take a look at the screen, there's like a total of 24 participants with
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:43.440]   a control group. So it was a very thorough, double blind, multiple participants, control
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:48.000]   groups type of study. And if you're familiar with the whole bio energetics, you know, this
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.440]   is sort of a summary here. And this was of the pain management frequency where you can
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.520]   see the blue, blue is bad, green is good, you know, in terms of just the ability for
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.800]   the participants who are suffering from physical pain were then, you know, were before and
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:08.200]   after subjected to the frequency card.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.880]   And then actually, well, you did it through upgrade, you used upgrade, right versus give
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.800]   Bessa cards? No, we actually gave them the cards.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.200]   Okay, yeah, no, no, we, they couldn't, yeah, exactly.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:23.640]   Okay, so, so the participants were then exposed to the card. And then on the right side, you'll
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.400]   see the bio energetics signature of their body and all, you know, all 60 different organs
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:34.440]   and Meridian, where it completely turns to green. And this was the physical pain group.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:40.360]   There was a second study done on the heel 360. And the same thing was done, another separate
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:47.080]   group of 24 individuals, double blind control group. And they were also a before and after,
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.000]   and I just wanted to share that with you, because it just really, really hones in, you
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.600]   know, when you take a look at these individuals now, had all sorts of different pain issues.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:01.440]   It wasn't just if you read the study, you'll find that the country, the second group that
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:07.400]   did the Hill 360 had all sorts of different problems that weren't just physical pain,
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:12.040]   but they had mental disorders. They had, you know, stress factors that were all sorts of
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.400]   all up and down heart surgery, you name it, individuals. And so these individuals, different
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.760]   group of people were tested with the heel 360. And again, you'll see that, you know,
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.840]   right off the street, they had some green, you know, they weren't as severely in pain
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.960]   as the first group that were just tested on pain. But they did have blue and the blue
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:36.280]   is bad, green is good. And once they were subjected to the heel 360, complete 180 with
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:41.120]   a full green profile, which means their bio energetics, all 60 meridians on their bodies
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:46.440]   were harmonized with the frequency. And that's what the studies show. You know, and I think
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.560]   that's, it's so important that people understand that, you know, that, you know, when your products
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.200]   are released, that they go through so much vetting, not just through the healer network,
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.240]   but also through iGAF, be it BESA, and you name it. So I just really wanted to point
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:04.920]   out that these two new frequencies do have certificates of from BESA Institute and that
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:10.760]   they've been basically shown in the studies to do what they're claim to do. So I just wanted
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:17.760]   to add that. Yes, well, thank you for walking us through that and for mentioning that and
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.840]   certainly that added a little bit of time not to get this Institute. But for several
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:30.560]   reasons, we felt it's necessary. We do that, you know, because first of all, I think this
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:36.640]   should be all process in general to not have just energetic vetting, but do scientifically
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:44.080]   as well. And then it's frankly also required from a regulatory perspective. And yeah, we
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:49.360]   try to get it done before we actually launch it. No, that's great. So, you know, this is
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:56.000]   great. Anything else you wanted to add about this? No, other than just a big thank you again
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.600]   to the community, you know, to you and everyone else that participated because this was amazing.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:10.640]   And I think, you know, of course, also if you didn't win now, you still, I mean, that was
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:16.080]   an amazing process. You went through and you created something pretty amazing and that
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:24.400]   basically through this community sourcing, we now have new frequencies that turned out to be also
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:31.760]   amazing, right? It's something we couldn't have thought of before, right? It's, you know,
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.480]   we didn't go into this with any expectation, right? We neither low expectations nor high
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:43.680]   expectations. And yeah, it was just great to see. And also to have seen how much fun people had
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:50.640]   with this. Yeah, this was super cool. And you let us know, community, if, you know, you want
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:55.840]   to do this again at some point. So this was definitely fun. Well, you had definitely,
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.600]   you definitely will want to do this again. It just seems to me like the healer, you know,
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:07.040]   the healer network now just sort of includes the whole community, you know, we're all one giant
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.760]   healer network trying to help each other and help ourselves and our loved ones. And it just shows
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:19.840]   so much thoughtfulness and cooperation and love. It's just I'm just blown away by how wonderful this
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.960]   contest turned out. So congratulations everyone. And thank you so much for help for doing this.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:32.080]   I think this was an amazing testimony of just how well our community works together. And especially
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:38.240]   how focused everyone is on healing. And I just think it's great. And I'm just so happy to hear
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:43.360]   this. So congratulations, everybody. You did a great job. And thank you everyone for submitting
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:48.720]   your your submissions. You know, it's just a just a great group effort. Awesome.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:57.520]   Thank you, everyone. So thank you very much. And that's it. So the announcement of the winners
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.160]   gets posted today on Telegram. I'll have this video up as soon as possible. It's early in the
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:09.840]   morning right now on Wednesday. And then of course, next Tuesday, the frequencies will be available
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.480]   on quantum upgrade and then down the road available by card. And again, you know,
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.480]   because it's going to be included in the heel, there is no right, Phillip, there's no additional
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:24.480]   cost. You know, if you're a quantum upgrade subscriber, this just gets made available to you
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   at no additional cost, which is the incredible. I mean, this is why, you know, you were mentioning
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.440]   this to Luke story, you know, in the interview was like, how incredible it is. I think Luke was,
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:40.480]   you know, was commenting that how incredible it is that, you know, the the community that
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:46.960]   subscribes continually gets more and more value without any, you know, nickel and diming and
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:52.480]   they just get value and new things keep rolling out and that quantum upgrade is turning out to be
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:58.960]   really, really beneficial and, you know, really great resource. So yeah, kudos to you, Phillip,
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:04.000]   for not charging everybody every little thing. So thank you for bringing this to us and giving
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.720]   it to us for free. Then, well, thank you. And I before, yeah, because I know you're about to
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:14.640]   press the button probably, but I've forgotten one thing because we're also releasing another
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.800]   racehorse that is probably not of any interest to most people because, I mean, who has race
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:27.280]   horses, right? But we actually know of a few, a few people that we've gotten to know just
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:33.200]   randomly and that they they've been already quantum upgrade subscribers and they actually
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:41.520]   have race horses. And, and so we have a racehorse support frequency out there already. That is not,
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:49.120]   I repeat, not for during the race nor for during the practice is very, very important. This is a
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:56.400]   regular frequency to support the race horses just on a daily basis, day and night, whenever before
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:03.360]   races before practices and after, but not to be used during practice and race, just because it
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:09.200]   could be way too much for a horse. It's not intended for that. Now these people asked us that, well,
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.720]   what do you have anything for the race? And we said, well, for now, just use the quantum upgrade
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:21.760]   on booster without any frequency during the race. We now created one that is actually for
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:29.760]   during the race. So it's called then the race horse race frequency. And that one is indeed to be used
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:37.840]   for during the race and for during practices. And it just, it's, it's like an Olympic performance
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:46.640]   frequency for, for, for people, for humans. This one is for horses and it adds, yeah, actually a
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:54.400]   little bit of this fight energy in, but in a positive way. And it also supports the heart
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:30:02.160]   and everything. And it makes sure that everything happens at a maximum physical level without
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:09.440]   going a step too far, if that makes sense. And yeah, so for everyone who's interested,
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.600]   okay, so this will be available as well.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:16.800]   Okay, so there's a third one. Okay. And that one will be the race horse racing during race.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.120]   And that's going to be released on Tuesday as well next week.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:25.360]   Yes. Oh, cool. Okay. So it's like a Olympic frequency for horses, right?
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:30.480]   Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. I wonder, well, okay. So what's the difference between a human Olympic
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.560]   and a horse Olympic? Is it really that way? It's completely different.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:42.000]   Being you know, don't, don't, don't ever try this. But don't horse frequency for yourself. I mean,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.920]   you can, of course, try whatever you want. But I wouldn't suggest it really. Okay,
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:52.480]   do the Olympic and then vice versa. The Olympic is, is different. You know, we have a completely
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:59.280]   different mechanism on how to function and how to use our muscles and everything. And so that's
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:04.480]   why this is really targeted for horses. And actually, specifically race horses, because
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:11.600]   race horses are different from just a horse that's just out there standing and eating grass.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.200]   It's very different. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We different.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:20.400]   Wow. That's really cool. We got to, again, whenever you have a chat, I'd love to just
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.240]   sit in and chat about this kind of stuff later on. But I'm fascinated because somebody,
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:28.720]   somebody once asked in the upgrade group about, I think they were like a performance runner,
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.280]   and they were saying, hey, you got, you know, is there a frequency for that? And we're like,
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.480]   yeah, you know, there are people chiming in and going, yeah, use Olympic. And I was thinking,
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:40.080]   so I commented, yeah, why don't you use the race horse frequency. I just tinker with it. But you
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:45.200]   know, if there's a, I guess if there's a detriment to that, I guess we should have did, you know,
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:50.160]   explain that to people. But I was thinking, hey, I'm a mammal. The horse is a mammal. You know,
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.760]   why not give it a, you know, why not try it for your next marathon? I wonder whatever happened to
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:32:00.640]   that guy. Hopefully, hopefully, still okay. Yeah. Yeah, I know he is okay. He actually
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:06.480]   texted me as well. And yeah, I recommended the Olympic performance as well. Oh, okay.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:12.000]   Okay, humans stick. Okay, okay. So yeah, because I was just thinking, I couldn't think of why one
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.720]   mammal would be different than a mammal. But you're right, we all vibrate at different frequencies.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:22.400]   And obviously my dog is on a whole different vibratory level than I am. As I'm sure that
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:26.880]   applies to horses and all other animals, but very interesting. So, oh, hey, thanks for sharing that.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.680]   I forgot to ask about that one. Okay. So hey, you know, thank you, everybody. Thanks, Phillip.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:38.240]   Any parting words? Well, again, thanks, everyone. Thank you, Kay. I really appreciate that you
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:44.560]   you know, ask me to do this here before I fly to London to this big conference.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:52.320]   And I'm glad we did it. Thanks to everyone and rest assured the winners will be contacted,
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:58.480]   will be in touch, and then it'll get your prizes relatively soon. Cool. Thank you very much. And
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:04.400]   one last time, congratulations to the winners. Thank you for everybody who submitted. Couldn't do
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.920]   any of this without you guys. So thank you very much. Aloha, everyone. Have a great day. And boy,
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:16.240]   am I looking forward to trying these out. So thank you very much, Phillip. Have a safe trip to London,
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:20.880]   too, by the way. Yes. Thanks so much. All right. Aloha, guys.
