[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host, K Elmer. And this
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.440]   video is a further installment in the video series. Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.160]   Layla Quantum Tech, where I'm basically going over all of the frequently asked questions that pop
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.200]   up in the telegram support groups for the Layla quantum devices, as well as the quantum upgrade.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.400]   I had the opportunity to sit down with Philip and get his take on several topics. And this video is
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:33.040]   to cover the concept of how to align the use of quantum energy and quantum services with all of
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.280]   the solar flare activity that we've been experiencing in 2024. So this week happens to be, and this
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.360]   video was recorded with Philip on October 10, where we're actually experiencing a geomagnetic
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.920]   storm on planet Earth right now. We're actually getting pummeled right now as I record this video.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.040]   So the timing is great. So I had a chance to sit down with Philip, who is the owner operator of
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.000]   Layla Quantum Tech, and get his take and get his input on how to deal with solar flares from a
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.280]   quantum perspective. So let me go ahead and play that clip for you. And just want to say thank you
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.520]   very much for watching the video. First slide is the solar flares. Okay, so that was a big one
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.280]   that's come up. There's been three X squares just this week. Today's October 10, 2024. We are
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.520]   right in the process of having a large CME hitting Earth later today from from an earlier X class
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.400]   flare that was this week. Earlier in March, we had one of the biggest flares ever recorded
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.160]   that literally shaped and and vibrated the magnetosphere for months. So, you know, there's
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.240]   there's been questions about the solar flares and all that cosmic, you know, energy coming on to
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.360]   the planet. So the question really is, is like, you know, there's been a lot of discussion, but
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.080]   what's your take on all that energy coming in and what's your recommendation for the best way for
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.120]   people to, you know, who are sensitive to it, you know, to kind of, you know, how do we use
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.440]   Layla Quantum Tech, you know, and upgrade to kind of help us, you know, kind of buffer the effect
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.840]   and help ourselves kind of just deal with that. You know, so what are your thoughts there?
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.360]   Yeah. So I spoke a little bit about this topic with Sahara Rose in her interviews. So in case
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.400]   people are interested in in also tuning into that one, but here we can get into more detail. So,
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.760]   generally, I really appreciate these flares. And it's a very good thing from a consciousness
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:42.240]   perspective, because we get specific waves from the cosmos, basically, that stimulate our own
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.840]   awakening. So that's a very good thing. It's also natural. It's not, you know, that there's
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:57.440]   some shady guys that are doing this, right? So this is just happening. It's part of this whole
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.720]   development currently. And from that perspective, it can be appreciated. Now, obviously, it can have
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:15.040]   when it's really, really rough on a physical level, it can have some impacts to the nervous
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:23.280]   system, even it can have an impact on electronics, right, that electricity goes down, things like that.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.440]   But those are, I call them side effects, right? And, you know, I mean, if the power grid goes
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:38.320]   out for a few days, you know, is that the worst? No, it isn't. But if we start to wake up on a
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.760]   broader level, that's really a good thing. So I just appreciate those, and I don't have anything
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:53.040]   negative to say about them. If we're sensitive, and also if we want this to be a relatively smooth
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:01.440]   ride, it's always good to synchronize us with these waves, because they feel foreign to us at first,
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:09.840]   and whatever is foreign tends to hurt or overwhelm us, and with quantum upgrade, as well as the
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:18.000]   Lila quantum products, that synchronization goes a lot easier. And if we set an intention for that,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.200]   also, it really helps. So what I would do is just do what you always do when you own a blog,
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.600]   or when you have quantum upgrade, just be in the field to the frequency that you feel
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.880]   you need at this point, or at a given time. And it just by nature makes it easier, because
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:49.520]   what it does, it strengthens your bio field, and it helps you to be in contact with such
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.200]   energies on a different level. You're not so dense, you're rather expanded, you're more open,
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.560]   and that actually all helps to take in these energies and just go with the flow, if that makes
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.000]   sense. Okay, yeah, because, you know, for a personal question, you know, like, there's all
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.360]   these different effects that have been measured, whether it's heart rate variability, I mean,
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:23.120]   all these things are actually physical effects of solar flares, people with blood pressure issues,
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.120]   heart issues, people that, for me, it really affects my sleep, and I get very fatigued,
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.160]   other people get really jazzed up. So for someone like myself that gets really fatigued,
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.920]   and it has a hard time sleeping during these things, would you recommend being a good
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.360]   idea is like, turn off quantum upgrade for that period of time, maybe, you know,
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.280]   put some of the blocks to sleep or whatever, but, you know, like, is it like, is it a point where
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.760]   not only, you know, it's a good idea to align with it, but, you know, is it too much energy,
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.400]   and it might, would it be a good idea to kind of like, if you're getting fatigued by the effects
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.960]   of the flares, turn off everything? I would personally not turn it off, I would actually turn it on,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.240]   I would just make sure at nights that I have it running at 500 then, if I feel it impacts me,
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.880]   I mean, at 500 it does not add anything to your sleep in a negative way, it just can't,
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.160]   that would be totally just a mind game that we're playing with ourselves, 500 definitely
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.800]   doesn't do anything there, and it helps to harmonize us though, so it does have a little bit of a
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:38.160]   protective shield, right, on one level, and that's in all the good things, so that's what I would
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.360]   personally do, you know. Okay, no, that's a great suggestion, all right, thanks.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.640]   Yeah, I get that, we've actually been thinking about a physical product, and
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.080]   I will tell you more about it after that, I'm just bringing this up right now because it's
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.320]   besides the eye drops, this would be another physical product that also would carry frequencies,
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.720]   but also actual physical, natural substances, and we're not talking about melatonin,
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.000]   I'm actually not a fan of that at all, and I'll let you more about it, and then at some point,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.520]   also the broader community. Okay, great, so thank you very much, I hope that was helpful and
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.480]   interesting for you, and if you'd like to like and subscribe the video and subscribe to the
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.120]   channel because I'll be covering a lot more of these topics on Layla Quantum Tech in my channel,
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.840]   as time goes on, so thank you very much for watching the video, hope that again was helpful,
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.600]   and Vyland Dung for our German friends out there, and have a great day, Aloha!
