[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another video by me Kay Elmer and in this
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.240]   ElectroHealing series I'd like to share with you my research on brown gas
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.120]   generators and do a product review of the three generators I mentioned in my
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.480]   prior video of which I own two. So back in that video a lot of folks expressed
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.360]   an interest in doing this comparison and doing a review so you could learn a
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.120]   little bit more and I learned a lot as well in the research and so I just wanted
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.200]   to share it with you. So let's just jump into this product review. Obviously I
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.560]   just want to get in some disclaimers. The statements made in this video have not
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.680]   been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or

[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.360]   procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned. Reliance on any
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.600]   information appearing and discussing this video solely at everyone's own risk and
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.320]   some material discussed in this video is theoretical and conclusive evidence
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.520]   remains to be published. Alright so now the three generators that I had mentioned
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.800]   in my prior video on brown gas were these three. Starting with this one on the
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.040]   left it's the companies called hydrogen for health and the model is called the
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.600]   H2 life actually version 2. That's the current one that's being sold and the
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.760]   price on this one is 1445 as of December 27th. It's actually on sale like now for
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.760]   the holidays but the listed price is 1445. The other browns gas generator is from
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.400]   a company called AlcoA and it's called the Hydro Genie and it's currently
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.360]   retailing in 1997 and this third one here is from a company called Eagle
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.920]   Research and the product or the generator itself is called the AquaCure AC50.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.760]   It's currently retailing for $24.99. Of these three I own the hydrogen for
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.440]   health H2 life and I own the Eagle Research AquaCure AC50. These are the
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.080]   two that have happened to have purchased and I'm actually going to walk you
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.720]   through how I use both of those machines. I didn't get the third one for this
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.720]   review because it's Christmas and I no longer have any more money. So I've only
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.200]   got the two okay and don't have an extra 2,000 so I'm only going to review the
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.600]   two but I did look on the website. I did a you know side-by-side comparison of all
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.680]   of the features so I can talk to the AlcoA and rating them specifically and
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.160]   purely by all of the information that's on their websites about each one of
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.880]   these three products is how I'm going to do the comparison and then I'll walk you
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.200]   through the product review because I actually own two of these guys but you
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.560]   know honestly like I said in my last video each one of these companies is a
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.520]   well-established company that goes back a long time and they produce very high
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.840]   quality products so I think these are three of the top brownscast generators
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.200]   that are out there on the market right now and any one of these three are just
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.000]   is a really exceptional product so but let me get through and start talking to
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.760]   you about the features. So the main features now when you actually look at
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.000]   the you know they have all these different things that they do I mean all
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.160]   these little features of it alarms and gauges and timers and all that kind of
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.400]   stuff but you know when it really boils down to what really makes a difference
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.280]   between the three different products is this list of features right here so
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.080]   right off the bat all three of these machines serve as a brownscast inhalation
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.880]   machine so you can use it to breathe in the brownscast if you you know to you
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.680]   know to bring that into your body through breathing you can also do a
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.760]   brownscast water you can use it as a bubbler to drink the water which is
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.320]   what's really recommended to get the full treatment if you're looking at
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.640]   increasing you know your antioxidants which is what brownscast is superior for
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.840]   is is to drink the bubbled water and do the inhalation together and that's really
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.200]   the brownscast treatment that that's that the whole purpose of these
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.680]   machines right is so they all do that they all do the inhalation they all
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.880]   produce water they also because they produce the water and they also produce
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.880]   the gas you can also use any one of these three machines for topical
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.240]   applications which is not something that's really brought up a lot but that's
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.680]   one of the most advantageous aspects of these machines is that you can apply
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:10.640]   either the brownscast water on wounds and issues on your on your skin or you
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.840]   can actually put the gas and you can you know using like a cupping type of a
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.680]   device and I'll show you that in a video coming up and you can actually
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.360]   apply brownscast directly to your skin or through the water apply brownscast
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.760]   water so using it topically is also something that has been found to alleviate
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.840]   pain improve healing and some a lot you know just it's a lot of really
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.600]   interesting things that that you know brownscast can do so now the other
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.940]   aspect that I really look at when I looked at these three was the was the
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.520]   concept of portability because you know these two the h2 life and the
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.240]   hydrogen are quite small so they're actually very small compared to the
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.400]   aquacare and and because they're small they're very portable and they would fit
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.920]   like into a target tote bag you know and so you could carry those and and I'm
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.240]   thinking of bringing one to work now because the smaller one and that's
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.240]   something that I could bring or I could take with me and it would be very
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.000]   simple to do so now there's nothing wrong at all with the aquacare it's it's
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.320]   just larger it you know you can put handles on it but it wouldn't be as as
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.040]   versatile and from a you know just a just carry around tiny little box then it
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.520]   would be then these two other models so I kind of rated it as yes it's very the
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.600]   portability factor is these two are are much higher from a portability factor
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.040]   and I really don't see aquacare as a portable device it's more like you
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.800]   put it down somewhere and you're going to use it where it lives but here's the
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.760]   other thing about the other features that I personally this is all my opinion
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.720]   right it's everyone's got an opinion but my opinion here is that you know the
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.160]   other features that really stand the aquacare apart from the other two which
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.680]   is something that now from the standpoint of simultaneous usage okay now both the
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.000]   all these machines put out about the same amount of gas except the aquacare
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.040]   puts out about twice as much from an output standpoint so if you were to like
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.560]   take an inhalation dose like one hour on the H2 life you you would just get
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.240]   X amount of gas right breathing in gas or you know and so the idea here from
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.080]   a simultaneous usage is that the aquacare puts out so much gas that it's
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.960]   really geared towards two people using it at the same time so that's what I mean
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.280]   by simultaneous usage I see the aquacare being a bigger machine putting out
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.880]   more gas is something that two people could do at the same time so you know if
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.680]   you are you know if you are married and you you basically you and your wife are
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.360]   sitting on the couch and you don't want to take turns but you just use it at the
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.520]   same time you're going to both get a very full dose of a brownscast machine
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.040]   otherwise if you take like an H2 life and you split it and each one of you are
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.920]   you know pulling off the same line of gas you're going to get at you're both
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.000]   going to get you know roughly half of the of the amount of gas because you're
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.760]   splitting it as opposed to this thing really puts out twice as much now that's
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.240]   my theory on that I've actually kind of sent out an email to George kind of
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.600]   asking him is that about the correct way to look at things so it's just it's
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.320]   just an opinion but that's kind of how I see it okay it's my opinion and then the
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.880]   other thing about the aquacare that it allows you it has a frequency generator
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.560]   built into it so for those of you who are familiar with resonant frequencies and
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.320]   all of the different frequencies let's say of the sulfegio you know scale or
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.880]   the nozier frequencies these frequencies have all of these different properties
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:40.000]   when it's played and it could be immersed into water it could be put into sound
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.280]   or it's you know music but there's a lot to be said and a lot of research and a
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.120]   lot of really interesting science about resonant frequencies and then what's
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.360]   really cool about the aquacare is it's got a built-in resonant frequency
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.880]   generator so you can actually embed frequencies into the water into the
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:02.040]   gas and that makes it very unique and the other thing too that the aquacare can
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:09.680]   do that the other two don't do is it also doubles as a welding device it's a
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:15.000]   welding generator so there's actually a torch accessory you can attach to the
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.880]   aquacare so when you're not using it for inhalation or bubbling water you can use
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.320]   it for a torch and we talked I talked a lot about torches in the last you know
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.120]   welding with HHO gas in my last video so if you want to learn about that go
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.400]   check that video out but being able to use it as a torch and as an inhalation
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.440]   and for water sets the aquacare apart from the other two and then lastly it
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.120]   produces because it's a torch it has the torch and it's water in water out right
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.900]   that's what I said in the last video that water out is new water and if you've
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.840]   studied water the work of Gerald Pollock or fourth phase of water Miyamoto and
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.760]   and the whole study of water one of the most amazing things you could ever get
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.920]   your hands on is water that's called new water and what new water is is water
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:07.160]   that's had its memory erased and it's perfectly pristine and you can then embed
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.400]   whatever you want into that water and then drink it and then go from there so
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.600]   there's a lot of this is theoretical a lot of it is is not mainstream science
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.240]   but it's out there and it's an amazing thing so for those of you who are curious
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.920]   tinkers I would suggest if you haven't heard about resident frequencies or the
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.520]   concepts of new water you know it's something you might want to take a peak
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.400]   at it is rather very very very interesting but it does that it because it
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   has a welding device it can produce new water and this is a protocol that George
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.920]   Weisman will be coming out next year to actually provide everyone with that
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.440]   protocol as to how exactly to do that so now after we now so what I'd like to do
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.480]   at this point is I'm going to walk you through the actual product reviews the
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.400]   two different generators that I have in my house and show you the different
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.400]   features and and and what and and all the different aspects of the two machines
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:04.880]   so we'll go ahead and do that right now this is the Opticure AC 50 and as I
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.520]   talked about in the vendor matrix this is the master power switch that turns on
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.760]   the generator the gas production doesn't actually start until you actually set
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:19.760]   the timer and it's it it's presets at 10 20 30 and 60 minutes and if you hold
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.720]   the 60 minute button down for five seconds then it'll run into continuous
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.960]   mode you know that there's gas producing when you see the green light now in this
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.040]   model here you actually have a gauge inside here so where there's a little
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.440]   blue light and a little ball that floats right on the top of the viscous of the
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:43.200]   gauge you can always see between full and low what your water level is this I
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:50.000]   just flushed this tank and so it is approximately 1 1 250 milliliters is
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.040]   just below the full line so that's whenever you're filling this back up you
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.600]   want to be right here at at 250 milliliters of electrolyte so that kind of
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.120]   is the perfect run in terms of fill for the tank you'll see this thing drop down
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.640]   as you use the machine because it's burning the water and turning it into
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.600]   oxygen and hydrogen and so as you see this thing go down right around in here you
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.760]   want to go ahead and really basically top off the tank taking water from the
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:24.520]   first filter and putting it into the tank up here but if it ever does go low
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:29.280]   it has an automatic shut off and an alarm that will go off when the when the
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:34.000]   water gets too low or if it's over full they'll be a red light over here that'll
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.200]   tell you that it's over full and it won't run when it's overflow as well oh the
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.960]   cycle just finished so let me go ahead and turn it back on for another 10
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.520]   minutes show you the meter here right here is the meter basically the bottom
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.760]   number is the percent of gas outputs you can push this button to lower so right
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.520]   now I am actually bubbling some water a glass of water for myself and you want
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.800]   to run it at 100% when you're doing inhalation you want to look at the that
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:07.840]   the chart for the size of the person you are and so for me average adult male
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:13.600]   human I'm around 40% in terms of gas outputs you don't want to you don't
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.120]   want to have the machine put out more than your body can saturate and this is
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.480]   the best way to do it so it has it can change as you as you do different things
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:29.200]   with the machine whether you inhale or bubble water or you know switch to let's
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.520]   say a smaller person you'd want to lower this number this top number here is
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.160]   controlled by these two buttons and that is the frequency that's being generated
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:44.280]   into into the tank and then it comes out through the water vapor through and
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.760]   then into the into the glass so you can actually play with resident frequencies
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.600]   and right now it's set at 432 and for those of you who are interested in
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.440]   frequencies you can take a look at sulfegio frequencies no geo frequencies
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.880]   and so forth and that'll kind of give you an idea what different resident
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.520]   frequencies are known for in terms of of health and wellness and so forth and
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:11.760]   that's pretty much it the nice other feature I do like about the AC 50 is back
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.920]   here you've got this this counter and this is a really helpful now like I said
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:22.440]   you can either go by the numbers from the specs which is every 10 hours top off
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:28.760]   the tank every a hundred hours you know flush the tank or after you know I've
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:34.040]   won this thing we're about two months now so I just know that based on where
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.520]   this water level is what I should do but you can go by timer or you can go by
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.000]   just watching the gauge either way so really what you turn it on and you set
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.680]   the timer when you turn on the machine it just turns it on you set the timer
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.800]   that's when the gas production starts you know that by the green light then the
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.400]   gas is actually being produced inside the machine it's in a tank right here
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.160]   where you see this nozzle goes down into the tank here and then there's this
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.800]   expansion capsule right here and that's where the allows the gas to expand if
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:08.600]   it needs to that comes out of this tube right here this is the refill valve but
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.440]   this tube right here is where the gas comes out and there's two filters this is
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.760]   the very first filter this is the standard setup of the machine by the way
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:21.600]   this is the first filter now some folks put the filter over here you can put it
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.760]   on any corner of the machine I just put it there because it's convenient for
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.280]   where I put it next to the couch so the first filters there and then the first
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.960]   filter then comes out of this tube right here and then goes into the second
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.280]   filter and then it comes out the second filter and then it goes and then you
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.440]   bubble into your glass and you drink from here so that's the main there's two
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.920]   filters and the whole point of the filters is to make sure with 100 percent
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.600]   certainty that none of the electrolyte will go into any of the water you drink
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.000]   or the gas that you breathe so it's important to have the two filter system
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.800]   and then you actually drink out of the third or breathe the gas out of out of
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.480]   the second filter but either way you want the gas to go through two filters
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.880]   before you would breathe it or bubble it in water all right so that's pretty
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:16.200]   much for the AC 50 and really the best features about this are just the fact
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:21.360]   that you can change the output of the machine you can run it continuously and
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:26.960]   and this continuous mode by the way it's continuous you can literally if you
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:32.760]   watch this this volume go down you can actually refill it up here with this
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.960]   this port right there using a syringe and you can you don't have to turn the
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.800]   machine off it literally will continuously run until the moment comes
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.920]   where you hit the 100 hour mark where you need to flush the whole tank out but
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.680]   you can continually keep filling up the tank and run it continuously 24 hours
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:54.960]   a day until you hit that 100 hour 120 hour mark we actually need to do some
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.480]   maintenance on the tank flush it out filter out the electrolyte and so forth
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:03.560]   so that is by far one of the huge pluses of this machine is that it does have a
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:08.600]   continuous mode and you can run it all night long or for days if you wanted to
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.080]   the other thing is you can really kind of if you're in the resonant frequencies
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.640]   this is a huge plus and the other thing too is the is the gauge it goes up and
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:22.080]   you know it also puts out a lot more gas in the other machine all right so one
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.520]   last thing I wanted to show you about my aquacare is I've actually done a
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:32.960]   couple of mods to it just because I like to tinker so as you know there's a
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.600]   two-step filter process so what I've done is here's the first filter and
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.760]   here's the second one that comes with the machine but what I went ahead and did
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.920]   was I went and got another bracket and these are just your regular bicycle
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.440]   water bottle holders so you can just buy them they come in pairs so I just
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.800]   swapped out the old one and put in the other ones now so I got matching pairs
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.560]   I got a second bottle they're right like I think about eight or nine dollars on
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.680]   Amazon and so basically I've got the gas coming out of the chamber into filter
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.720]   one comes around and it goes into filter two which are now snugly set on the
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.840]   machine so now you know I don't have to like this thing's not off to the site
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:15.800]   separate which is kind of convenient so that's my first mod is I've just
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.080]   modified the filters so that they're both now the same type of bottle and
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.800]   attached to the machine the next mod that I've actually kind of wanted to do
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:31.360]   was I was looking into the research on nano bubbles as compared to regular
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:36.600]   bubbles and so what's real interesting is you know the research shows it anything
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:43.800]   under one nanometer in terms of a bubble when suspended in water doesn't like
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:49.120]   rise to the surface because the bubble is so small it remains in suspension so I
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:55.080]   just had this thought so I went and got myself a 0.5 micron a bubbler and these
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.840]   things are like $22 but I went ahead and swapped out now this original was
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:06.120]   filter - right this was filter - and it came with the stone filter that Eagle
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.520]   Research provides with the machine so I swapped out the stone filter went and
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:16.600]   got myself a 0.5 micron nano bubbler stainless steel nano bubbler and now the
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:21.720]   concept here is is now if I got two filters coming out of the second filter
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.880]   now is what you would basically drink and or inhale but the idea though of
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:33.000]   having you know just hold on I'm gonna need both hands so now that I've got the
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.240]   lid on so now the third filter the second filter that came with the machine
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:42.240]   which is now a separate bottle because I've already got one filter and one
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:48.040]   filter all right so if I hit the machine let's just say I'm setting it at 20
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:52.720]   minutes and I decide to like okay I'm gonna go ahead and just bring this thing
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.640]   down because I want to inhale so here's the idea if I'm gonna go into an
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.280]   inhalation mode I don't want to go past 40 right so when I that's if you look
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.520]   it up the chart it's all about your lung size so I'm gonna set this thing down
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.560]   for inhalation but here's where the tink comes in because I'm tinkering so now
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.320]   I got two filters on the machine the third bottle which was the second filter
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:22.640]   with a nano bubbler okay which supposedly creates a better suspension of gas is
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:28.480]   bubbling into this bubble here and now I'm using this jar and out we come and
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.440]   this is my nasal cannula so what I'm doing is I'm doing it's a twofer so
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.400]   while I'm bubbling water to drink because now I can put in what I want to drink
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.240]   in this guy and I washed it thoroughly by the way you know before I started to
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:46.120]   use this for drinking but now it's like hey I can breathe while I bubble instead
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:51.360]   is separately two birds one stone I don't waste any time on the machine because
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.480]   up until now like at nighttime like I'll like do a jug of water when I get home
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.680]   from work and then I'll sit down and then breathe but now I could do the jug of
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.480]   water and breathe at the same time so yeah that's a little bit less wear and
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.600]   tear on the machine but more so it's just I like to tinker and why not so
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.480]   here's something to think about is getting a nano bubbler instead of the
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.320]   stone bubbler setting up you know your rig but you know it's all about how you
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.800]   want to play with it but this is just you know just for efficiency standpoint
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.840]   I can breathe which I'm doing right now as I'm talking and I could bubble water
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.600]   at the same time so when I'm done you know breathing through the cannula I can
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:32.700]   just drink this water and it's good to go this thing is super clean it out it's
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.760]   got drinking water in it now of course these two guys over here have distilled
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:43.560]   water and hey I'm good to go so it's just one of my things I'd also like to add
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.520]   on some of the other accessories that come with this machine I want to talk
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:52.000]   about that now obviously there's this for topical applications if you see
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.240]   that there's that little hole right there and so you would basically take any one
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.720]   of the two beings that come with the machine plug it into this and it's what
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.520]   it is it's a silicone funnel that's what all it really is it's an expandable
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:09.720]   funnel but then what you do is you would place this over over like a wound over
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:14.040]   a bruise over anything that's sore and the only thing so far I've tried it on
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.240]   that it doesn't really work that well is my knee I got knee problems and this
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.840]   thing does not go over a knee very well because as you can imagine it's supposed
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.640]   to be flat but otherwise you'll see this thing just fill up as it fills up with
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:30.760]   the gas and you can do browns gas topical applications using this little
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.920]   funnel guy and it does work you got pain you got sore muscles hey guess what
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:39.480]   happens when you infuse browns gas into your skin it where it hurts pain will
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.080]   go away the other things that are now optional this so this comes with the
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.880]   machine what's optional that doesn't come with the machine are basically you
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.320]   can use you can get a bag and put it over your leg and there's a couple of
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.440]   straps in here you see these white straps so this is just a bag the size of
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:01.000]   your leg and if you can get these in any drugstore you can also order it off
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.160]   of Eagle Research's website there's one for arms I've already done the arm one
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.760]   and you know honestly it's just if you want to like treat your whole arm you
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.560]   want to treat your whole leg and then also to you know the gloves that come
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:18.520]   with the the gloves that come with the machine any one of these you could use
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.360]   to treat a whole hand you could treat a whole leg or a foot or knee or you could
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.320]   treat your own arm and that way when you know treating it topically so all you
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:33.040]   really do is you just plug this into your second filter and then take the
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.560]   stone or you can just pop the stone off put it inside the bag right at that where
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:41.560]   it were the you see where the straps are and then the thing fills up like a
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:46.480]   balloon and there you go and you just treat yourself and for as long as you
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.520]   want make sure the balloon doesn't pop let a little bit of pressure out every
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.800]   now and then and you can get a really good topical treatment of browns gas on
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:01.960]   any part of your body whether it's a flat part arm part leg part hand part and
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.960]   like I said the only thing that really doesn't work well is knees but you know
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.080]   this doesn't work on these but if you put your whole leg in a bag you can
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:13.240]   treat your knee okay so this is some stuff that I went ahead I bought these
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.960]   extra things to go with my machine I've used the arm one so far it works great
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:23.360]   I've used the hand one so far it works great in terms of a bubbling with the
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:27.320]   bubbler you just use the same bubbler it's really not complicated at all I've
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:32.560]   tried this works okay on on most of my body parts step knees but that's other
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.320]   than that and then that's really it the last tank that I kind of was doing before
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.480]   I came up with the idea of doing the double filters is you can get this at
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:47.160]   any aquarium store okay and so the idea is is that you would pull off the second
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.960]   filter it plugs into here and then you've got on this here and then you've got it
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.640]   coming off of two so like two of you could breathe at the same time or you
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.720]   could bubble on one and breathe off the other or so forth you can turn this is
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.240]   off position but you could turn them on like that you could have one on one off
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.840]   anytime so I actually have this set up for a while a lot of is this kind of a
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.760]   tubing nightmare but this worked out pretty well for a while so these are
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.320]   really cheap there's like I don't know four or five bucks but you can get one of
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.560]   these splitters here and then you could basically do two at the same time I know
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.480]   a lot of you folks are are married and it'd be really helpful for you guys to
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.560]   breathe at the same time or do like I'm doing run it through the run it through
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.320]   something you're both going to drink and then take the tube out of here right and
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.760]   have this thing come into this this guy like this and then both of your
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.640]   cannulas could come off with that so two of you could breathe at the same time
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:43.440]   while you're making but water triple that's a three for anyway so these are
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.520]   just some of my ideas I thought you guys would enjoy some of the ideas I've come
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:50.640]   up with but yeah I'll tell you what this has been this is really saving me a lot
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:56.240]   of time so that's my mods I hope you enjoyed those ideas
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:03.040]   I also wanted to mention that the AC50 AquaCare comes with a handle kit so you
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:09.080]   can actually install handles on both front and back of the machine if you
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:14.720]   want to just pick it up by handle I don't find these really necessary but I'm
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.640]   still on the fence of whether I'll install mine the one thing that I
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.280]   haven't gotten around to you because I don't have a specific purpose for it but
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:27.240]   this is the the torch kit the torch kit you can get for the AquaCare this is
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.120]   another major feature that the others don't have and this actually mounts right
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.240]   on to the front there's actually a hole if you feel right in here you'll feel a
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:42.360]   hole there's a hole right in here somewhere it's in there somewhere but
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.680]   there's actually a hole behind the other it is right there you'll find this
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.440]   hole and then you know there's a tube that goes that way it connects to this
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.880]   thing and then it actually pumps gas into this container which pressure
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:59.800]   pressurizes it to torch level and then you've got your torch right here and the
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.640]   tubing and everything is inside so the idea is you can literally use the AquaCare
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:10.760]   as an HHO welding torch which is this so it's it's a lot it's a
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:15.680]   multiple different a use machine which is why this one is it's like you know
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.720]   sort of like the top of the line it can be a torch it could be a bubbler it could
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:26.320]   be an inhaler and then of course as you're gonna see next year George has
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.320]   actually worked George Weismann is working on a protocol because what comes
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:35.480]   out of the torch it's called new water and because water in water out but the
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.640]   water out is new water has no memory and there's a lot you could do with water
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.240]   with no memory so yeah so it's a pretty versatile machine a lot of other
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:48.160]   different accessories that come with it and then one last thing I forgot to
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:52.520]   mention in addition to the bags you can get now this actually comes with the
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.640]   machine as a safety feature but one of the cool things about this as well is
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:02.120]   that you can slide the you see this hole right here on the top there's this
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.920]   hole right there you can slide a tube in there and then you can actually do eye
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.600]   treatment as well with HHO gas so our Browns gas right so you can actually put
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.400]   this on and you can treat your eyes you can obviously like I mentioned before
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:21.680]   legs hand arms that sort of thing so very versatile machine lots of peripherals
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.320]   and accessories that come with it so it's definitely you know it's
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:31.040]   definitely like it's it's my favorite machine so there you go okay so here's
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:37.440]   the hydrogen for health H2 light model Browns gas generator and as you can see
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:44.160]   it also has essentially the same configuration standpoint you know it's
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.160]   a it's much smaller as you could tell it's a lot smaller it's got it does come
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.360]   with a handle but it also has where the water that the giving sort of the gas
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.960]   comes out it doesn't come out the top like the AC 50 or the aqua here so it
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:02.320]   actually comes out the side so the gas comes out the side it goes into filter
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:07.880]   one then it pumps into filter two right and so it's the same exact configuration
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.320]   of the double filter and then out here and it goes to the glass that you're
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.880]   bubbling or if you just disconnect right here you can plug in your your cannula
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.720]   and then breathe the gas directly so the whole idea is exactly the same with the
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:26.200]   double filter as well now the thing that really makes this different is that all
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:33.280]   of the bubblers that H that hydrogen for health provides are the stainless steel
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.560]   nano bubbler so that's kind of nice it's a nice feature because those things
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:41.560]   aren't cheap so high quality parts there in terms of the bubbler like but again
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.920]   you know as I said you could always buy your own and then in terms of simplicity
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:49.680]   I mean this is so simple I just set it up it took me less than five minutes to
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:54.720]   set this one up as opposed to this takes a little while to set up you know but
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.600]   once you get this this one is like five minutes and you can get it set up you
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:04.040]   just put some three grams of a lie in here distilled water if you turn it on
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:08.080]   it's red starts off red empty and then it turns green minute it turns green
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.640]   it's full you're good and then when this light turns off then you want to add
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.560]   some more water and keep it full if it ever gets too low and you're not not
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.560]   paying attention it'll get read and you're you're good you know then it stops
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:23.680]   this is just a timer there's no frequency device in here but it's just a timer
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:28.360]   and this this is the the setting it's 30 minutes and then once you turn it on
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:32.360]   that's your countdown it's count downs to zero and that's really it there's
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.520]   you're on and off switch and this is your dream sorry this is your drain I
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.160]   mean so the whole idea when you have to actually perform maintenance on it you
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:44.040]   don't have to tip this the one up and upside down because it is this is the
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:48.880]   only thing that's important to note it this these bubbles I mean these filters
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:55.560]   are connected there's a hose that comes out you cannot disconnect this I mean
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.440]   the filters from the machine they're connected so you know you know this is
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.320]   not a machine you want to be flipping upside down because you've got these
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.800]   two bottles right there so I mean they are they're stuck in they're good but
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.080]   you know it's not designed to be flipped over to empty it out so it's got this
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.120]   little drain valve right there they're just but they just didn't upgrade to
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.840]   how their drains work so now there's this little plug so it's like this
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.560]   perfect little plastic plug-in you don't have to mess with it plug it in this is
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.800]   the drain hose and it drains right into your sink I actually wouldn't want to
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:27.920]   you don't want to you know don't throw it away it drains into like a container
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.600]   you know then you would just put some hot water flush it out and then put the
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:36.160]   lecture like back in after you filter it so if you need to filter I'll show you
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.160]   later what that means so other than that this is really the H2 light you know
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.240]   like again it's a lot smaller and you know one of the beauties that I've kind
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:48.200]   of you know this I got this as a backup because if this guy needs maintenance
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:52.200]   during the week it does take a while and I just don't have time during the week
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.800]   so and I don't want to break my routine and then I got this guy and you know I
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.960]   really like because it's just the portability of this thing it's super light
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.160]   like here I can pick this up with one hand right so it's super light this guy
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.120]   you need two hands to pick up it's not super heavy it's just big so you know
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.440]   this the H2 light is is just a really nice little machine I really do like it
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.160]   a lot and I you know honestly this thing fits in a target tote bag and I'm
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.800]   taking it to work and so that's going to be one of my little perks I'll be able
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.600]   to take this to work and I'll be able to do inhalation at work inhalation at
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:28.160]   night and you know I have bubbled water all the time having to it is you know
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.040]   definitely advantageous and then the only thing though this is the thing that's
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.600]   most important about the two different machines between the aqua cure browns
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:39.600]   gas generator and the H2 light browns gas generator you know is the is the
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.840]   cell technology this is considered a wet cell this one's considered a dry cell
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.760]   and what that means is the wet cells don't overheat these guys will get warm
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.560]   after a while and so the the max continuous runtime you could set this
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:56.920]   timer to 9999 right but no matter what it's gonna it's gonna stop producing
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:02.640]   continuously this is very important it does not produce continuously past four
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.600]   hours what happens after four hours is it goes on and off every five minutes so
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.440]   go on for five minutes they'll shut off for five minutes because it's it's
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.240]   over heat you know it's it's reached its threshold on temperature and so that's
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.200]   the only issue with this one is that you're gonna get four hours continuous
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.360]   and then on and off every five minutes thereafter whereas I mentioned this guy
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:28.320]   here he goes continuously you need to flush the tank so I did ask you know
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.920]   Steve at hydrogen for health okay so how long would it take if I just turned it
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:36.560]   off could I run it for four hours straight again you know and he says it
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:41.640]   takes about three hours 45 minutes to four hours to cool off completely before
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.240]   it will run another straight four hours but either way though I mean you're
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.120]   still fine with five minutes on five minutes off but that is a difference
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.440]   between this guy goes four hours eight hours twelve and it'll go days it'll go
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:56.440]   days without stopping and continuously produce so there's the difference in
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.560]   the technology that's really the probably the most important aspect of the
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.840]   technology of the generation of gas is the wet and dry cell comparison but
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:10.600]   otherwise you know these two are gonna produce hydrogen I mean H.H.O. gas and do
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.480]   a really good job for you could tell this guy's just bubbling like crazy and
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.600]   then you know both of these machines report that you can generate you can
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:24.320]   saturate water with both machines one liter every ten minutes so you know one
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.240]   glass probably take just like not even five minutes just a bubble of glass and
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.560]   and you're good to go so both of these machines are exceptional machines built
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.720]   by really good American companies so you know what great service I mean both
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.640]   George Wiseman over here and Steve Dell over here I mean I'm telling you any
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.440]   issue any question any problem that I've had with either one of these machines
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.880]   those gentlemen have stepped up they respond on weekends I mean I don't
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:52.240]   expect him to and I'm but you know I mean yeah it's just amazing I mean and
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.960]   you're never gonna get that level of service anywhere else you know not in
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.320]   you know US so you know hey good job guys we're building two great machines
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.360]   there are definite differences here obviously again you know this is just a
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:09.520]   Browns gas inhalation and water bubbling machine it does come with
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.240]   cannulas so you can swap out the bubble with the cannula you can also do like I
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:17.520]   was doing with my mod over here on the aqua here you could put in a third
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.520]   bottle so you could bubble while you breathe you know that's just a mod you
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.440]   could do to this machine is like I did with this machine so you know it's just
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.840]   it's really up to you what you want to use it for and it but the main thing
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:32.200]   you know it you know it's I love this it's portable and it's nice so I do like
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.440]   that aspect of it and it's oh it's my other favorite machine so anyway good
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.200]   job guys on building these machines I hope you this helps you understand the
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.960]   difference between the two and if you got any questions you know shoot them on
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:51.480]   over all right one last tip for the Browns gas generators is distilled
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:57.960]   water distiller bottom line if you're gonna be doing this go and buy one of
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:02.720]   these things they're not even a hundred bucks on Amazon or eBay this just distills
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.360]   water because all of your filters and what water goes in the tank all of it
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.720]   has to be distilled and you're gonna run to the store all the time and buy
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.720]   distilled water or you can just make it and keep it in jugs but I'm telling you
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:19.040]   every weekend or every other weekend I just distill a gallon of water I always
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.600]   have distilled water on hand because the water that I need to put in the
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.840]   machine you know the Browns gas generators are distilled so get a
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:31.840]   distiller it'll save you a lot of time in trouble less downtime and so forth and
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.440]   you know it's just a plug and play makes distilled water all right that's my last
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:42.000]   tip okay well welcome back and now now that we've kind of covered the the
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.720]   different product features of the two different generators and what kind of
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.840]   makes them the same and what makes them separate and you know unfortunately I
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.440]   again I'm sorry I couldn't I didn't have enough money to buy the third one to
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:36:00.040]   do this video too is enough and so but I'd like to talk about maintenance because
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.640]   you know there I make a lot of references to maintenance and the reason
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:07.120]   that I have to you know I didn't intend to have to is just that when I first got
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:11.720]   the aqua cure and I hit that hundred hour mark and I had to do maintenance on
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:17.000]   it it takes a bit of effort to do maintenance on one of these machines and
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.600]   so I wanted to just kind of show you a video I just recently did my my second
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.880]   maintenance on the aqua cure and I filmed it so I want to share that with
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:28.360]   you she kind of kind of understand what I mean by you know the different
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.080]   maintenance or what what it means when I say we have you have to do maintenance
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:36.520]   on this is a generator all generators whether you get a generator for your
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:41.600]   electricity or generator for gas these generators require maintenance these are
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:46.000]   not plug and play they're not like your simple consumer product you have to
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.840]   work at this so what I want to tell you is in the share with you is that there's
[00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:55.520]   really two types of maintenance that you need to do on these generators if you
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.920]   own one and one is just simply called you know just like refill the internal
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.240]   tank okay because the water you put in the tank the internal tank is now of
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.920]   course being electrolyzed and then it's it's getting used up and turning into
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:14.560]   browns gas and so the water level goes down as it's converting into gas and so
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.480]   you need to continually refill the tank and so if you look at the instructions
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.240]   by the on this is purely awful what the website provides h2 life is basically
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:28.920]   they're recommending it every 20 to 30 hours you need to top off the tank and
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.040]   fill it back up with some water distilled water okay very important
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.600]   distilled water the and hydrogen he doesn't have any comments on their
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:41.400]   website about what they need to do theirs but the aqua cure is every 10 to 24
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:45.320]   hours and it really depends on you so you can kind of see where when it comes
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:49.440]   down to fleshing the internal tank hydrogen he gets very specific about you
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:53.400]   know how much do you use it because the more you use it of course the faster
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.600]   you're gonna need to do maintenance right or more often you'll need to do
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.600]   maintenance okay so that's the kind of the concept there but there's no
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.400]   comments I couldn't find any specs on how often you would refill the hydro
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.720]   genie I'm just guessing it's it's almost the same size as the h2 life so
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:11.960]   probably about the same every 20 to 30 hours and the aqua cures 10 to 24 and
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.580]   again it really depends and like I was pointing out in the video just look at
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:19.440]   the gauge it'll tell you and so sometimes it could be 10 you know if
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.640]   you only you know some other times it could be more it really depends on on
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:28.000]   on really how much you're using it but not just how much you're using it but
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.120]   at what setting the output is like if you're constantly bubbling water is way
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.780]   different especially on the aqua cure because the aqua cure by the way is the
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:39.480]   only one you can change the output amount you can change the output
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:45.440]   percentages so if you set it for 100% and run it for 10 hours is way different
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:50.960]   and that's bubbling water setting then if you set it to 40 debris and you're
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.960]   running it at 40% for 10 hours right you can see there's a huge difference of
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:59.480]   the amount of water you're gonna turn into gas so just the math so it really
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:03.800]   depends right it really depends on how much you use it these two is just
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:07.240]   purely how much you use it there's no setting you can't change the output this
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.680]   one you can change the output on the aqua cure so it really depends bottom
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.480]   line is these are the very basic numbers that you need to keep an eye on if you
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.080]   own this thing and making sure you're keeping the tank full both of now all of
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:22.840]   them have an auto shut off if it runs out of water so you're safe there aqua
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.360]   cure actually added on there's an alarm as well okay but the bottom line is you
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.160]   gotta put water in the thing and you're gonna want to put in water every so
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.880]   often keep an eye on the gauge keep an eye on the on the lights and you need to
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:37.480]   put more water in there and the water that you put in the tank is gonna come
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.480]   out of that filter number one okay you have two filters you use the water from
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:46.560]   filter one and that's what goes into the tank okay now you just and then you'd
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.000]   fill it back up with distilled water the the filter okay now and now what I mean
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.760]   by or what is meant by when you have to flush the internal tank so flushing the
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:00.040]   internal tank and the reason you have to do that is particulates build up and
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.800]   and you know I mean all of these these companies they use really high quality
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:09.040]   materials and and but even with the best materials you know you'll have some
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.320]   impurities in the steel impurities in the manufacturing process and and so
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.360]   when you start using electrolysis and you're starting to run electricity
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:21.400]   between metal you're gonna get some particulates coming off of the metal and
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.640]   into the water and so those particulates build up and they form kind of a sludge
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.320]   and then you need to basically rinse that sludge out so that it doesn't
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:33.040]   interfere the more sludge in there the less gas you're making it affects the
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.160]   performance of the machine so all three of these generators require that you
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:41.080]   flush the tank now you don't throw away the electrolyte I'll show you that here
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.560]   I'm and I got a video for you I want to walk you through what I just finished
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.400]   doing with the aqua cure so you can understand what I mean by maintenance
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.040]   and flushing the internal tank you don't throw it away you keep that and you use
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.760]   that after you filter out the particulates you put it back in the machine
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:59.640]   all right but the whole idea though is it does require maintenance and and to
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.440]   give you if once you watch this little next video about how to take care of
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.160]   the aqua cure you'll understand that if this happens like on a Wednesday night
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:09.160]   and I don't have a lot of time during the week then I'm just gonna put that
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:12.360]   machine aside and that's why I got a second one that's the whole reason I got
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.240]   a second one because I just don't have time to mess with that during the week
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:20.400]   and so having a backup for me is really important because I'm trying to do an
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.480]   experiment right now I'm trying to do it like a multi-year experiment where I'm
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:29.640]   consistently breathing for two hours a day consistently drinking half a gallon
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.640]   once I get through the holidays which is very disruptive I'm gonna start that
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:38.400]   routine back up again and I I'm as I'm hell bent on on keeping up with it and I
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:42.240]   want to see you know what happens because everything I've read should be
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:47.600]   some real interesting things happening in terms of my health so in order to run
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.440]   that experiment I can't have any interruption so that's why I did get a
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:54.520]   backup which is the H2 life now here's when you have to flush these internal
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.880]   tanks per H2 life or hydrogen for health they're saying every 100 hours you
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:03.720]   need to flush the tank over here the aqua cure is also 100 to 120 now I just
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:09.200]   want to point out that everything on the website says 200 and and but I was
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.200]   recently talking with George and we and he was telling me that you know he's
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:17.760]   reconsidering it because of just the some machines build up sludge faster than
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.700]   others and he's now recommending a hundred hundred twenty hours okay so he
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.640]   just hasn't updated his website yet but that's what he's recommending it's what
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:29.120]   he told me to do and so that's what I am doing now in terms of the alcohol way
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.840]   hydrogeny they're basically saying hey if you use it less than two hours a day
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:37.560]   clean it every 12 months if you use it all the way up to four hours a day every
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:42.640]   three months you can see just you know twice as much is not twice as often it's
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:47.680]   you know you know it's a lot more often right it's four times a year versus one
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:53.840]   time a year so it is it's exponentially more necessary to flush the tank the
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.920]   more you use it and this is kind of what this shows but this is on their website
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:01.160]   and if basically use it four hours a day which I do I'm minimum use my
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:05.000]   generator four hours a day I'm bubbling water I'm breathing it I bubble water
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.560]   twice breathe as much as I can and so yeah definitely you would need to clean
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:14.120]   it more often and they're just going by this this scale and you know that this
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.360]   machine doesn't have a timer on it so it would be a pain in your ocoli to keep
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:22.920]   track of this to know when to do that so if you have a hydrogen I would highly
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.200]   recommend you just do it like just you know every you know if you use your
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:29.480]   machine I would just say hey every other month just do it anyway right don't
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:35.040]   wait and then that way you keep your tank clean and you keep your generating
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:39.440]   running at optimal performance all right so let's show you the video about how
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:43.640]   to maintain the aqua care so you have an idea exactly what that looks like because
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.480]   I know you like video you like examples so let's go ahead and show you that and
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:53.120]   we'll finish this up okay so this is the flushing procedure basically you just
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.920]   disassemble all the peripherals and take the cap off and then you've got this
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:03.560]   open tube you know I just poured into a pyrex and then I take it from there and
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:09.080]   I'll show you I use one of my spare filters I use the port plate as opposed
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.440]   to a cincter because it's caustic fluid you don't really want it to you know you
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:18.280]   don't want to use it with your oil once you're done using it with aqua cures so
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:22.640]   I just use a poor plate it's really easy to clean nothing will get inside the
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:26.640]   cincter you know glass so poor plates seem to be the way to go and then I'm
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:30.680]   just going to pour it into here filter out the residue I'll get the remaining
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:36.840]   caustic electrolyte in here and then I'll fork back in to the machine after I
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:42.040]   fleshed out with hot water and get all the residual you know sludge out of it
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:48.080]   so I'll show you how it goes all right so I've poured out the tank into this
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:52.560]   pyrex as you can see it's pretty clear and I'm going I'm right now I'm just
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:45:00.480]   doing a vacuum filter of the electrolyte so that I'm just using a 25 micron and
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:05.040]   you'll see that there's actually residue in the fluid in the electrolyte that's
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:08.920]   being captured by the paper filter so even though it doesn't look like there's
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.920]   anything there you can definitely see right there just where those holes are
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:18.560]   in the poor plate that is actually capturing any type of residual the very
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:24.200]   first flush there was a lot it was like mud this is the second one so once you
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:31.120]   get the whatever impurities from the metal out off the plates and then and so
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:36.120]   forth the second then from then on flush should be pretty clear I got just
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.560]   wanted to point out one thing I did mention I didn't mention earlier was
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:46.000]   our gloves safety first were glasses were gloves you do not want to get this
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.800]   electrolyte on you it is caustic and you know they do warn to be very careful
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:55.600]   about getting it on the paint I want to show you that if you do get it on the
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:00.480]   paint it will affect the paint I don't know if you can see it's really hard to
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:06.160]   come yeah if you see that right there it does it does eat into the paint it does
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:10.480]   eat into the metal if it touches metal so there's another spot on here the other
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:15.240]   day I noticed that it did that right there you see that that's where the
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:19.240]   electrolyte touch the metal so if it does that the metal it will definitely do
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:24.600]   that to your skin so be very careful but this is just how I do it I mean it's
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:30.120]   just to me you can you could put it in a you know like in a in a colander with a
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:36.720]   with a coffee filter coffee filters 20 microns I'm using a 25 micron Whitman
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:42.640]   or Watman filters the number four is 25 micron or just a coffee filters 20
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.000]   microns so you could easily do it that way and that's really what it is I'm
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.120]   just trying to you know clear it clear it up before I pour it back in and then
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:55.520]   meanwhile while the electrolyte is filtering to clean it and you want to
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:00.600]   save it this is really precious the more you use it the better electrolyte
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:05.400]   it works in terms of inside the machine so at this point now what I'll be doing
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:11.640]   is with the filter got me the funnel that comes with the machine filling it
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:17.440]   up with hot top tap water I mean basically not boiling but just hot tap water you
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:22.000]   fill up the tank just move you know just kind of shake the machine around empty
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   it out into the sink and you do that several times until no particulates come
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.480]   out particulates meaning you see that right there a little thing floating like
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.960]   you could see the things that are little itty-bitty tiny little things you just
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.280]   want to make sure there's nothing you just want to make sure it's as clean as
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:41.600]   possible before you put the filter electrolyte back in and we'll go through
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:48.640]   that in a second okay all right I want to show you you see these little the color
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:54.440]   you see how it's kind of like purple and there's all these little specks yeah
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:59.400]   that's the impurities of the metal in the plates and they use high quality
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:05.000]   metal but you know after every hundred hours you know this stuff builds up
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.600]   affects the gas production so that's what you're trying to rinse out of your
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:12.520]   machine is you want to keep rinsing hot water in there and so all that stuff
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.680]   comes out and once you get it so that it comes out and it's completely clear
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.640]   and you know it's cleaned out you empty this and then you put the electrolyte
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:24.240]   back in yeah I'm just going to show you this sink so you can kind of see all
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:28.760]   that stuff that came out of the tank and all that in there you know it messes
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:32.640]   with the gas production and that's why the machine doesn't run as well after
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:36.240]   around a hundred hundred and twenty hours so just as what this step is called
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:40.880]   flushing the tank so you want to get all that out all right so I'm done
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:46.240]   filtering the electrolyte I'm done flushing the tank basically filling up
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:51.240]   with hot water swishing it around tipping it over pouring it out I think I did
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:55.240]   that seven times to finally get it to where the water was clear and no little
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:59.160]   particulates were coming out put the funnel back on rapid with the towel
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:04.520]   because now I'm going to be pouring the electrolyte back into the machine and
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:09.480]   this is where you know it's important to know this the volume of volumes but
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:15.040]   basically it's one hundred or one or one liter and two hundred fifty minutes so
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:19.680]   twelve hundred and fifty milliliters of electrolyte need to go back in so what
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:23.720]   I'll do is I think I got a little over a liter of electrolyte that came out of
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:28.680]   the tank that I've now filtered clear and then I'm going to take the water out
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:34.200]   of filter number one and then fill and then basically fill it up with at the
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.720]   twelve hundred fifty milliliters mark and that's what all that's going to go in
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.960]   the tank it won't be full you don't want it to be full you want it to be
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:44.840]   about seven or three quarters full and it operates just fine that way so that's
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:48.040]   what I'll be doing and I need both hands so I'll show you any second one I'm
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:54.600]   done okay so I poured one full liter in and I measured out another two hundred
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:59.640]   and fifty milliliters of whatever was left over from what filtered and then what
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:04.040]   was came out of the filter number one and then whatever's left over and
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:08.400]   filter number one I save in a jar to use that to fill the tank back up later
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:12.760]   okay because you always save your filter your number one filter water it's you
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:16.160]   can use that to fill the tank that's what you're supposed to do and then
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.840]   something that I've learned just from using it is that you really got to be
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:24.920]   careful when you're filling this thing up it takes a while for the the measure
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:30.320]   here to pick up the amount of water in the tank so I pour the first liter in and
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.760]   I'm just gonna wait and then make sure that this thing levels off before I fill
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:39.560]   in the other 250 because yeah you could overfill this thing really easy where
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:42.520]   you'd overfill the tank with this thing showing up to here right because it
[00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:46.080]   takes a while for this thing to catch up so give it some time don't be in a rush
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:51.360]   and just you know and then just do it one step at a time all right well you know
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.760]   I'm glad that you guys got a chance to see that you know it is interesting I
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:58.120]   wish I you know there's some kind of I had no idea that's that's what I had to
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:02.880]   go through every single time in the beginning I don't I'll mind I'm glad you
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:06.880]   know I'm glad I have a machine and and but that's what it takes you have to sit
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.800]   and do that now you don't have to use all of that filtering stuff if you guys
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:15.040]   are not familiar with making C60 which is the bulk of my my YouTube channels
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:20.020]   about carbon 60 and I have all that filtration stuff in fact that poor
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:25.720]   plate filtration rig is left over from a video I made about filtration rigs so I
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:28.960]   just happen to have one right and I have all the gear because I'm always
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:33.360]   making C60 oil and all sorts of different things on this side I have a
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:37.080]   little lab so I just happen to have that now if you don't have one of those like
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.840]   I did say in the video coffee filter in a colander all right you don't have to
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:44.200]   get fancy but but that's the idea I mean I just happen to have all the lab
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.880]   gear so but that's what it takes to to you know keep your tank clean and you
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.680]   got to do that every hundred hundred twenty hours all right so now I'm just
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:55.000]   gonna do a wrap up here I again you know this is the hydrogen for health H2
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.360]   life and the price points here you know it's it's basically 1500 2,000 2,500 so
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:09.400]   it actually goes up step up step up step up these two are are basically almost
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:13.960]   the same in terms of just the you know the basic features but the one thing I do
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:18.120]   want to point out about the alkal way is it's a wet cell so this puppy will
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.600]   run and run and run and run and it won't stop and it won't go into like
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:26.040]   alternative mode like the hydrogen for health H2 life well okay so this one is
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:31.080]   a wet cell the hydrogen is a wet cell so it has the same continuous function
[00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:35.560]   that the aqua cure does and so you can kind of see where the wet cells do cost
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:39.520]   a little bit more and it's that whole issue of if you ever want to run this
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.200]   thing all night long or you've got multiple people and pets that you want
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.680]   to have use this thing then you're gonna want to get a machine that's going to
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.440]   run a lot longer if it's just you and you're only using it then you know then
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.600]   yeah you're perfectly fine by getting by with this guy so that's the whole
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:57.520]   difference between these two is once continuous and once every you know it
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:00.440]   goes up to four and then every five minutes right and then if you've got a
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:05.160]   larger family and you just really want to do a lot more with it and you have a
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.600]   lot more features and a lot more flexibility and a little bit more
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.960]   experimentation you could do with this then you know then this is the aqua
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:15.600]   AC 50 I literally would recommend any one of these it really depends on your
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:20.260]   specific use case and what do you want to use it for and like I've actually up
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:24.960]   to when I first bought one I bought the aqua cure as the first one because I
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:29.840]   fully intended to breathe all night long that's what the goal I'm trying to
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:36.120]   work with but I ran into a snag and my snack is like I'm a mouth breather at
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:40.360]   night and so I got the short story I got this stupid chin strap thing right and
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:47.160]   and I put it on and and I keep my mouth shut so I breathe through my nose to the
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:51.760]   cannula and that didn't work so I tried some stupid mass thing and I couldn't
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:55.440]   stand it and yeah I'm still working on the breathe all night long because I'm a
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:59.680]   mouth breather a good thing I don't have things crawling on the roof right or
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:04.160]   the ceiling so I'm still working on that but you know you know I didn't think
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.320]   about that when I first got the aqua cure but so at least I'm trying to
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:12.200]   breathe it is every single time I sit down I'm using it so and that's kind of
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:14.760]   where I'm getting to so I'm still working it out but that's kind of what I
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:18.480]   bought it for is I wanted it to I wanted a generator that just runs and runs and
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:24.480]   runs and runs right but that's it so that's my review and and a little bit of
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:28.600]   information about maintenance and so now lastly I just want to walk you
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:35.000]   through just the the features just to kind of go over it one more time this is
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:39.040]   my features matrix I'm just I'm not going to go through this exactly point
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:42.040]   before and I already talked about all of this stuff but I just want to show you
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:46.240]   that I did do a features vendor product comparison here are all the different
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:50.080]   features these are the different specs coming off of all their websites the
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:54.040]   red is highlighted is what's really different about the machines the one
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:57.440]   thing I didn't cover and and this is going to be in the video description as
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:02.360]   a PDF okay so you guys can download this and read it but what I did want to
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:06.440]   point out that I didn't before is this is what the machines come with so
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:11.880]   depending on which machine like the h2 life the hydrogen or the ac 50 you know
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:16.160]   they all come with dual scrubbers does a filter one filter - they have different
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:20.800]   you know bubblers they come with their electrolyte which is usually lie these
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:24.960]   two machines come with two nasal catenulizers one only has one now these
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:29.840]   ones have the steel bubbler you know that's the h2 life and then over here it
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.760]   just a stone bubbler the aqua care has a stone bubbler as well but again you
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:38.000]   could get your own steel one and I know like I did and then it has external gas
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.200]   applicators so and an extension code for you know hose if you want to do like a
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:47.200]   foot bath or try to do your bathtub which is a whole other subject okay and
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:50.800]   then these two have their user manual so that's what the machines come with and
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:56.000]   so you have just a few more things that come with the machines other than the
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.600]   h2 life but it's not you know a major difference you can always go out and buy
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:04.960]   an extra cannula if you've got two people wanting to use the h2 life and so
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:08.240]   forth now the one thing that I did find that was interesting was that there is
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:12.760]   a difference in the warranty and I just want to point out the other reason I got
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:17.360]   an aqua cure is it's got a lifetime warranty against mechanical defect and
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:21.800]   then I found out the h2 life has one as well so I got that's kind of really
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:25.920]   where I lean towards I mean if you talk into a person who's been around for a
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:30.800]   couple of decades and they tell you hey you know I stand by my product for well
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.200]   the lifetime of the company right obviously then you know that's that's
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:38.040]   something to me so this is a real big difference here is the warranty on these
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:42.480]   machines over here Steve at Hydrogen for Health he gives a one-year warranty in
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:46.760]   lifetime service facility for repairs and a lifetime warranty against mechanical
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:52.200]   defect over here on the aqua cure AC 50 George Wiseman provides a one-year
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:56.280]   money back satisfaction guarantee it's unbelievable you can just tell him you
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:00.040]   know it's satisfied you know nine months for now you know that this is this is
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:03.360]   how much this man stands behind his product and then he also provides a
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:07.080]   lifetime guarantee against mechanical defect all right so both of these
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:12.200]   companies are are just they stand by their product and then so nothing wrong
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:15.360]   with alkalway but I do want to point out that they're warranties different they
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:20.120]   provide only a three-year warranty on the generator and if you want any more if
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:23.960]   you want an extended warranty then it's one year at a time on the electronic
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:27.600]   components that you can extend and you pay a little bit extra for the extended
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.440]   warranty and that's how they've structured their products so it is
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:34.160]   different and because it's different I wanted to point it out all right the only
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:40.280]   other perks that come with these machines is you've got on on the aqua cure
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:44.360]   you've got access to Eagle researchers online resource library so he gives you
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:47.760]   a password and then he's just got a ton of research he's been doing since he's
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:52.080]   been around you know since 1984 again the customer service from both of the
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:56.040]   companies that I bought generators for is absolutely exceptional I mean it's
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:00.320]   just unbelievable how well these people are just so responsive and you know for
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:04.040]   all the folks at that kind of got interested in brownscast from my other
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:08.040]   video I've been seeing people popping into the cell and telegram chat room I
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:12.720]   think at least a half a dozen so far that I know about I have purchased you
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:16.520]   know brownscast generators either from George or from Steve and they are
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:20.720]   reporting exceptional customer service as well so it wasn't just me and those
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:23.400]   by the way when I bought them from these two guys they don't even know I made
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:27.720]   videos so you know I just regular Joe so you know you just didn't want I don't
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:33.600]   want anything to interfere with just how I'm treated versus anything else and so
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:37.360]   that's really it and and that's really it and they're all made in the USA so
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:43.800]   that's it for my review thank you so much for watching I really appreciate your
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:47.800]   time I know that you know again you're really busy and and just watching my
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:51.960]   video I'm you know thank you thank you for taking your time I hope you learned
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:55.680]   something I did I learned a lot and I'm just so happy to be able to share it
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.080]   with you and that's the whole premise of my YouTube channel so thank you again
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:02.360]   for stopping by thank you for watching all the way to the end and if you have
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:05.120]   any questions you know I changed the name of that telegram chat group for
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:09.520]   this I just renamed it electro healing so it matches the video series but if you
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:12.800]   have any questions about electro healing you know anything everything else right
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:16.960]   I mean whether it's Raymond Rife technology or Likovsky or you name it a
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:22.360]   PMF you name it and you know browns gas it's all about electricity you know
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:26.360]   that electrically spent expanded water thing that's a big deal you know that
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:29.480]   this is where those those conversations and questions are happening or you can
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:33.720]   just post a question in the YouTube comments below so thank you again for
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:39.520]   stopping by have a great weekend and again happy new year 2020 here we are I
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:43.840]   can't believe it right so anyway happy new year thank you have a great day and
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:47.120]   thanks for watching below
