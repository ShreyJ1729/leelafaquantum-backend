[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   Aloha and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and this is
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:15.080]   one of my impromptu videos because I just was setting up this new box and if you're wondering
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.200]   what this box is, it's actually an incubator for kittens and puppies where they need to
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.640]   give them oxygen and what I'm setting this box up for is my older dog who's sick right
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.480]   now and I wanted to treat them with some browns gas and so I kind of wanted, as I was setting
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.520]   this up, I was thinking this might be a good thing to share with people because some of
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:46.680]   you who own these machines, you own generators for hydrogen or browns gas or even have oxygen,
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.440]   there's different ways you could apply and a lot of people just bubble to water or they
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.840]   use their cannulas, I've got mine right here, you know, so if you've, this is Tinker Academy
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.800]   headquarters by the way and so like I've got my cannula, right, so I'm always like basically
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.240]   you know as I'm sitting at my desk I've got the generator running and I'm inhaling and
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:17.960]   or I am going to then plug in a stone so I've got my you know my bubbler stone so I'll be
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   filtering water and that's used primarily to main use cases but you know as I was doing
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.480]   this I realized that you know I've never really done a video or mentioned in depth a lot more
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.640]   about other uses for your browns gas generator so I just kind of want to share with you some
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.080]   of the different applications you could use and where you could get the supplies so the
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.920]   very first thing obviously this is your standard browns gas generator, this is the H2 Genesis
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.640]   model from Biohacker something, it's been a while and so all really I do is I just went
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.800]   and got this six foot cord or hose off of Amazon and it's got the two connectors so
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.280]   here's one and so then with this connector this is really what you all you need is this
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.320]   six foot hose and then you could start plugging it into different accessories and peripherals
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.920]   so this box I got off of Amazon I'll cover that and at the end of the video in terms of the link
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.040]   and the only thing about it it's just you know it doesn't have a it didn't come with washers
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.480]   but it has a hole right here and this adapter and so really what it is it's just plugging in
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.920]   you know the hose into this adapter it's not airtight they're not supposed to be
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.240]   it's for oxygen and so you know it's sort of a cheapy way to do it there's more expensive
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.520]   models I'll show you on Amazon but the idea here simply is that you don't want it to be
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.440]   airtight because you know you're going to create a pressure in there by pumping browns gas in
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.480]   there and you want it to kind of you know be able to vent out obviously anytime you do any of this
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.840]   stuff huge disclaimer it's you know oxygen hydrogen and and browns gas right they're all
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.240]   incredibly flammable so you've got to be in a non-static environment you know no no electrical
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.480]   static also you know and then of course you know be really careful about flame because these
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.040]   things could blow up and they will and so you got to be really super careful but I just kind of
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.280]   want to share so idea number one is that there's a box that you could get and it got little latches
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.680]   here and then holds it up once I put my dog in there and I'll show you what that looks like
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.160]   the the lid you know it just comes unassembled it's really super easy to some like three minutes
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.560]   and then here are some of the other accessories that I've used with my browns gas generator
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.680]   sorry for the lighting I'm in just one of those weird moments where I just decided to grab a
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.680]   camera and start talking so the first things first is these are all the different things that I've
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.600]   done if you just go again get yourself a pair of safety goggles this is a safety science goggles
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.480]   they're called safety goggles and you could use that now the reason it's they're really good
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.960]   is they got this really good seal so you just put the goggles on if you want to treat your eyes
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.680]   with browns gas and then you would just kind of just stick this right here inside you know on
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.480]   on your on your on your on your cheek and then the gas is going to be pumping into these things
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.600]   now these again these aren't airtight either and so as the gas is kind of enveloping your eyes
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.440]   this the goggles will hold it you know hold it in so that you can treat your eyes with browns gas
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.480]   or hydrogen and so that's one way to do it for you if you want to treat your eyes now another way to
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.960]   do it and this is something I got from AquaCare because I also own a AC50 and so basically it's
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.520]   just this little tiny you know expandable cup and it comes with AquaCare has different
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.480]   hose adapters you would need to use the AquaCare with this one because of the way that they've done
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.720]   this but you can use any kind of coffee I'm sure you could get these off of Amazon I've never tried
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.040]   because I've got this one or any like you know like target or team or anything like that but
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.400]   basically it's like a funnel it's essentially a expandable funnel and then basically you know
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.320]   you connect the hose to one end of the funnel right now you'd need to use an adapter because
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.320]   of the way that this thing works but you could figure it out and then you just would cup yourself
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.600]   you would just put this over whatever hurts like if you have a wound or you know or just like let's
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.440]   say a particular area that's small enough for the for the funnel and you put the funnel over that
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.920]   area and then boom you would then pump browns gas into the funnel hold that against the let's say
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:29.160]   your your wound and then you could then apply browns gas and or hydrogen directly to your wound for
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.720]   healing purposes there of course now also on also I think they I think George sells these on his side
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.440]   which is the Eagle research site but you know if you just go on Amazon as well you can get the whole
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.040]   leg so basically these are called cast covers and so you can go get a whole bag that's meant for
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:52.680]   your leg and you can then apply browns gas to your leg let's say if you've got you know anything from
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.160]   a burn psoriasis xm you know you want to treat that with browns gas or hydrogen on your leg then you
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:07.160]   would get a basically a cast bag right it's called a leg glove and then you could then put that over
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.080]   your leg place this right you know we're at the top of your leg and the thigh tied up you know not
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.400]   tied up too tight you know you don't want to put a tourniquet but if you look at the the little bag
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.240]   here you can see where they've got kind of like I'm sorry about the leg it sucks here yeah there you
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.840]   go so you can kind of see how you would then use the straps to kind of you know you know keep the
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.040]   water out if you've got a cast but in this world in this application you would then you know want
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.760]   to keep the gas in so that's one way to do it of course now there's such a thing called an arm
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:44.360]   glove same thing it's for your it's a cast bag if that fits your hand and it goes all the way
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.400]   up to your your middle arm again you would strap on you would take the bag put it over your arm
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.720]   and then put the hose right here inside the the top of the bag and then put the straps on and
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.920]   hold it tight so that then the bag fills up full of browns gas for hydrogen to treat your arm now
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:08.120]   i've done actually i've done this i've actually put use this bag i will one like it you know they
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.880]   wear out and i use this bag for one time when i burn my hand so i just i just just basically put
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.400]   my hand in a bag pump the gas in there for good i don't know half hour an hour just as i was watching
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.640]   television and treated my wound with browns gas it worked really well pain went away
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.280]   immediately healed twice as fast okay then the other thing too i kind of want to point out now
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.840]   these are bags you can just get on amazon like again there i said they're cast covers for taking
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:42.600]   showers and then another thing too then if you go to the h2 biohackers website which is where the h2
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:50.520]   genesis comes from uh he actually sells these what he's actually created browns gas
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:58.360]   baggies and so what these baggies are is basically made out of material so it's not plastic so these
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:04.440]   are these are plastic and the only problem about the plastic ones is that you will sweat and it gets
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.000]   really gross and that's why you know it's like a one-use kind of thing but they're cheap but you
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.400]   know they work okay but here's what he's done he's kind of like i can't really describe some kind
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:19.640]   of a nylon material like for parachutes or something but it's really thin and it breathes but it will
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.360]   hold the gas in but then once there's a certain amount of pressure the gas releases through the
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:31.400]   fabric and so he actually creates these bags and you could use this bag for your hand i've got
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.040]   another model of this baggies sells a couple of different versions where he's got one for legs
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.840]   where you could use it on your knee on your elbow and so forth this one is just a full-on bag the
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:47.400]   other bagg has us you know one of these uh cinches on both ends and so you basically would put the
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:54.120]   bag on you would just cinch it tight uh with the with the hose inside the bag and then you could
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:09:00.360]   treat a hand a foot uh and so forth and then you use the other bag that's got cinches on both ends
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:07.320]   so it's more like a a sleeve and then you could then use that to treat knees elbows and things
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:14.920]   like that so so yeah so hydrogen for health i'm not sorry h2 pile hacker uh has these bags and
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:22.520]   these are like the breathable kind uh purpose made for browns gas um you know uh atopical treatment
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:28.520]   these are on amazon amazon uh you can get this anywhere you just it's just any cup at all i think
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.640]   the trick is going to be is the adapter and then the whole box too the whole box is for uh i got
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.640]   that on amazon so i kind of walked through at the end of the video all the different websites so
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.520]   you guys kind of get an idea so again i just want to say that i've you've been using browns gas for
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:50.680]   wall over five years i have treated burns and cuts and sprains um with browns gas and it works
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:56.360]   exceptionally well it really worked well on burns uh and so i think it's it's a great way to use your
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:02.360]   browns gas generator uh in another way other than just bubbling water and inhaling okay so you know
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.600]   it's a tool and you spend a ton of money on this thing why not get the most out of it and use it
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.080]   for healing purposes so there you go so those are all the different options i'm using uh maybe if
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.400]   you got a different idea or something you know you're doing i didn't mention please post that in the
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.160]   comments that'd be great so anyway i'm gonna go ahead and uh put the dog in and i'll show you what
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:26.440]   that looks like okay so i've got uh norman in the box i just wanted to kind of show you my settings
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:33.480]   typical h2 genesis the top numbers the frequency i've got it running at 50 because of the box
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:39.000]   normally it's 40 for humans it's pulling about three amps and so right now the water level is
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.960]   good so gas is boiling coming through the first filter the second filter through this hose and into
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:53.240]   the box so there's norman like i said he's not doing well he's pretty sick so i wanted to treat
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.800]   him so i thought uh well you know i do bronze gas all the time and it's super helpful for me
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.160]   so i'm going to go ahead and get one for norman now unfortunately the box is just a little small
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:10.680]   for him uh they come in three sizes this is the biggest size rated for a 25 pound critter uh normans
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:17.000]   28 so he does fit and uh he doesn't look unhappy this is literally the first time i've done this
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.800]   like i like i said i just was doing this and thought i'd just whip out a video just to kind of share
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:27.880]   uh because it is interesting and it's my my new tinker so anyway so there's norman uh got the
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:33.800]   browns gas going into the box and what i wanted to try to do is just see if this helps him feel
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:40.280]   better um and uh and i'm just going to run him like for an hour in here or as long as he will
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:47.160]   let me he seems pretty calm doesn't seem upset being in a box so that's a really good sign so
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:53.000]   anyway that's what i'm trying to do i'm trying to leverage uh browns gas uh it's helped me so i'm
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.760]   trying to help my dog and uh thought i'd share that with you plus all the other tinker stuff i've got
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:04.840]   going on uh but anyway so that's norman hopefully he feels better soon and um yeah
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:11.800]   so that's that's how you do it so that's uh how to give your small dog uh browns gas or molecular
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:17.160]   hydrogen now there is one other way to do it but you have to sedate it and that's how veterinarians
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:23.240]   do it so i will show you that on amazon but i did consider that but uh there's no way i'm gonna be
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:29.080]   able to hold a mask up to a you know a dog that's awake and so you know they have uh what they call
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:36.040]   anesthesia masks uh for applying gas to animals and they're just masks that come in different sizes
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:42.520]   you put over a dog's or a cat's uh you know face and so but you know that the animals always are
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.720]   sedated because you know your animals they hate having stuff on their face so i did consider that
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.200]   but i just realized that there's no way i'm gonna hold hold that on norman's face for an hour and he's
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.600]   gonna just get pissed off but right now look at him he's pretty calm he's pretty calm in there
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:03.080]   i did wake him up from a nap so that's probably good timing but uh yeah so this way he's gonna get
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:09.080]   some browns gas and uh this is all a uh a test to see how it goes i'm just trying to help my little
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:15.400]   guy and now for bigger dogs man i really don't have a solution for that you know i i don't have a
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.920]   bigger dog i got two little ones so but yeah bigger dogs would be quite a challenge because
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:26.120]   there's really nothing made for them you'd have to actually build one um they do have
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:31.800]   bigger boxes of these this guy was like i don't know about 88 bucks they've got big ones
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:37.480]   that you could use for a bigger dog but those are like four hundred five six hundred dollars
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.800]   uh and then anything bigger than that i highly don't recommend because you know you can get those
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.440]   those spas you know how people have those weird little spas with their head sticks out of a tent
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:52.920]   uh you know that was something that one time uh one of our uh telegram friends mandy was planning
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:58.440]   on doing and then we all reminder to that that that would be a very large explosion if it had that
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:04.440]   much gas trapped in there and caught on fire now if it's just this must gas it would be a big boom
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.680]   but it wouldn't blow my house up that probably would blow your house up so i don't recommend
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:14.840]   filling up a tent full of incredibly flammable gas but with this i think we're okay i just you
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.600]   know i made sure there's no static in here i don't have any of my electrical stuff running because
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.680]   that stuff that will definitely spark so i've made sure everything's turned off and you know
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:27.800]   but uh yeah so that's the other thing you know you could put them in a tent a big dog i mean
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.520]   but i don't even know how that would work because the dog's not going to want to sit in a tent
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:38.440]   you know anyway so that's just where i'm at right now i'm focused on the small dog anyway there you go
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.720]   okay so this is uh for those you guys who are interested in trying this uh just i just go on
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:50.120]   amazon uh type in leg glove for casts and you'll see them right here different brands different stuff
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:54.840]   i mean they're pretty cheap sort of uh you know they've got the bigger ones that inflate which you
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.680]   know either way you could use i mean you could just kind of tinker around but you can kind of see
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:04.920]   where you can find different uh uh bags that you could use for your legs and then of course on amazon
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:10.440]   type in the same thing arm glove for casts and you can find different ones now you know they've got
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.680]   different brands right but one of the things that i was looking at this i thought was kind of interesting
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:21.560]   which is for 1299 you can get like 50 of them and these are the same ones that veterinarians use
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.840]   you know when they're sticking their arms up you know large animals and so yeah so there's
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.960]   definitely different price ranges but you can definitely just go look for arm glove for casts
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:39.240]   or leg glove for casts and you can find those for arms and legs i did go on uh george's site here at
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:45.720]   eagle research and he doesn't sell them anymore so he originally was selling the bags along with
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:51.960]   selling the stuff for his brownscast ac 50 but it's not there anymore so the other thing too now the
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:57.960]   safety goggles just type that into amazon and the thing i just want to really point out is that
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:02.840]   they've got different kinds of safety goggles but you don't want to get this kind which is just
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:08.120]   the hard plastic pieces against your eyes your face you definitely want to get the nicer one the
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:13.960]   more expensive one which has got that rubber like i showed you a seal that'll seal in the gas
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:19.560]   against your face and so you kind of want that uh that rubber piece not just a piece of plastic on
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:25.240]   your face but a piece of plastic with you know rubber seal around it to hold the gas in uh the
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:30.200]   next thing to the silicon funnels again you know like i i was guessing when i made that other piece
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.840]   of the video but yeah you can get a really super cheap like five bucks you can get any one of these
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.240]   is what george was using or you can get this model right here and you just have to figure out how
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:46.280]   to hook the hose up to it but yeah that's definitely for like spot placement this is the pet atomization
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:52.600]   nest a pet incubato that i had purchased that i showed you in the video again it comes in three
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:58.520]   different sizes so the large one i spent eighty six forty two uh four and this is the box and again
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:03.160]   you know like they basically have uh different weights so like the large buck to small one
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:12.040]   i can accommodate pets within uh four point four pounds medium size pets up to um let's see
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:17.160]   thirteen pounds and the big ones up to twenty five pounds so and that's basically it now there are
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.040]   different models of this that get more pricey and again like i was telling you you know there's all
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.280]   these different ones you could get but they're pretty much for you know puppies and kittens right
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:31.560]   and you know you can get like a super expensive one like here's one that i was kind of looking at
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:37.080]   but i was like man i didn't want to spend that kind of money uh it is really large but you know
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.320]   it's not large enough for like a doberman or a pointer or something like that but you can see
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:46.360]   where you know the price gets kind of crazy so that's kind of why i just bought the you know the
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.480]   plastic one here and and you know as you can see it works just fine i got Norman here behind me he's
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.560]   he's just laying down now he's pretty comfortable he's not making any fuss he's just laying in there
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.520]   it's been uh approximately twenty minutes now so he's he's flying he's happy in there and he's
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:05.480]   inhaling brownscars now you definitely obviously want to get the tube so you're going to go oxygen
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.960]   tube six feet oh by the way if you want i just i'll put links in the video description to make
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:15.480]   it easy for you but oxygen tube and then you six feet right and then right here there you go it's
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:20.520]   like for $9.99 you can get a tube or you can get them cheaper if you shop around here's one for $6.99
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:25.720]   but basically that it anything for brownscars generators or molecular hydrogen generators you
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:32.360]   know if you're looking for supplies you just type in oxygen and and all of the supplies for oxygen
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.480]   concentrators are the same for that you know for what i'm talking about and lastly if you go to
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:43.560]   the h2 biohacker site as i mentioned here's the the bags that they make and so you can see where
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:49.240]   this one has cinches on both ends like i was saying the one i showed you was cinched on each
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.800]   and he sells them for like 60 bucks apparently they're on sale for 50 bucks for now for both
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.760]   bags and so you can kind of see where he's got different tubes and you know so and that's been
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.640]   benacosia great guy and so yeah so he's got all of these different supplies and
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:09.640]   you know for accessories that go along with his with his model he sells that h2 genesis but
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.040]   yeah that's really it um i just want to say hey thanks for watching the video again i just
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.720]   threw this together i didn't even think it through i just i thought it through as i was recording it
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.960]   because i thought i just would share it with you because it's a really great idea that i'm doing
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.360]   right now as you can see and i encourage all of you guys you know get the most out of that investment
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:31.000]   you guys spend a couple grand on these generators and so why not use them for everything you can
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   which is you know beyond just you know for health but you can use it for healing so
