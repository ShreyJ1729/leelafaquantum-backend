[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   Hello everybody hey I just wanted to clarify some stuff because I got a lot
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.280]   of questions after the booster video on how to burn stuff so I just wanted to
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:18.400]   kind of show you in a couple examples how to create a frequency card of your
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.600]   own and in this example what I'm doing is I'm actually gonna do an upgrade so
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:31.360]   to give you an idea how to do that here's my my testosterone card okay this is
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:37.160]   one of the five boosters in the men's booster okay so it's this has got all
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.000]   the men stuff in it right and what I want to do is I want to upgrade the
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.920]   frequencies and there's a list of supplements that are in this frequency
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.440]   right now this is set and I'm gonna upgrade it now because I've just been
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.240]   able to and thanks to you know Jack for sending me some of the really great
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.280]   frequencies to kind of mix into what I'm doing but he's actually sent me the
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.680]   actual frequency of testosterone that you would get is an injection you know
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.360]   if you were taking testosterone treatments and then also I'm gonna be
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.680]   adding a couple of new supplements ones called Tonkat Ali and the other ones
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.280]   Cordyceps which is a mycelium which are really really good for men so basically
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.920]   taking a really good card making it better by adding three new frequencies to
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.760]   it so how do you do that of course and here's a blank card so how the main the
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.160]   first thing you want to do and this is what's important that kind of wasn't
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.480]   covered in Philips video when he did the frankincense watch thing was if you
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.000]   have a source right and you don't want that source to pick up any frequencies
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.200]   from like let's say anything else you you put in in that example he used frank
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.920]   incense and a watch and he put it in there and everyone was saying well doesn't
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.640]   the frankincense then picked up the frequency of the watch or I eat the
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.760]   metal of the watch and the answers yes so now in order now if you plan on
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.400]   actually taking this later like you don't want to throw it away because it's
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.640]   expensive then all you need to do is you just take it and you put it in the
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.760]   cue block and you can put it in there for one one or actually 30 seconds to
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.960]   transfer the frequency or what I do is three minutes to just basically transfer
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.000]   the frequency and then fill it up with quantum energy burn it to the max once
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.880]   you fill it up with quantum energy it can't take on anymore so it won't take on
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.680]   like when I put that in with this metal card this aluminum card it won't pick
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.920]   up the aluminum from this card so then I'm feel I'm free to just go ahead and
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.400]   take it like a regular supplement after I'm done using it so that's the person
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.160]   you want to do is you want to take your source if you plan on ingesting it and
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.240]   you don't want the frequency of aluminum to be in your vitamins right all your
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.240]   supplements then go ahead and charge up your supplements first okay and then
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.520]   and then move on to your next step but what I do want to point out too though
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.000]   and you obviously know it that I've got two different supplements in there and
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.240]   now they're transferring their frequencies back and forth to each other
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.840]   which is no big deal because I'm going to take them together all right so now
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.160]   the alarms gone off I've taken the supplements out so now what I've got
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.920]   all right is I've got two different supplements and a frequency of testosterone
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.960]   and what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna add that to my master card of the
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.720]   testosterone so this is the original master card that's got all the testosterone
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.160]   you know boosting supplements in it so it's this guy right here real important
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.520]   not to mix him up so I take this guy and this guy's already he's basically a
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.000]   frequency source all right so I put him in here and I'm kind of just arranging
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.240]   stuff so I don't forget and now here's the new stuff I'm adding okay so I'm
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.880]   adding all of these new frequencies and they roll around normally I just use
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.840]   like a paper towel or something so now I've got the the stuff I want to add so
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.640]   there's three new frequencies and the old frequencies and what am I gonna add
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.160]   it to this blank card so I'm gonna go ahead and just put the blank card in
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.600]   there try not to forget which ones which guys and then three minutes boom hit
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.100]   the foot hit the timer and then in three minutes now what I'm gonna have is I'm
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.880]   gonna have a brand new testosterone booster card that's got three new
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.360]   frequencies in it and that's it to how to upgrade so then that will be the
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.280]   upgrade card and this one will be the old one right with the less than three
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.760]   this will be plus the new three and that's it that's how you create an
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.520]   upgraded frequency card you can't you can't upgrade the card that's the key
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.760]   thing that won't go anywhere you have to create a new one and that becomes your
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.280]   upgraded card there you go three minutes and I'm done and there you go I've
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.120]   taken the old testosterone booster I've added new source a new frequencies to
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.560]   it and now I have a new testosterone booster and a booster and I'm just
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.000]   labeling it new so I don't forget which ones which and now this is my new my
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.800]   new testosterone booster so if I ever were to make a completely new men's
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.680]   booster I would use this guy I've also done this with the anti-aging booster
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.120]   inside the men so I'm sort of working on like a new version of it but in the
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.440]   meanwhile I'm just doing like little simple upgrades which is you know no
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:23.360]   brainer all right so the next example I want to give you is how to upgrade your
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.400]   power capsule if you have a heel or a men's booster capsule and you want to
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.000]   upgrade it there's two ways to do it and if you have a cube lock or an
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.400]   infinity block that's the easiest way so now this are the two additional
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.000]   supplements that I have added to my anti-aging booster inside my men's
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.920]   booster and I'm sorry it's confusing but I've basically just recently added
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.000]   spermidine and thanks to someone out there in in telegram world for sending me
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.480]   this it's pretty cool I mean anyway I don't want to get an anti-aging and
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.120]   HGH okay so this is like stem cell therapy another for individual set me
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.680]   this so you know kudos to you guys I want to say thanks for you know sending
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.000]   me these incredible frequencies so so now I've got two new frequencies I've
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.800]   actually already burned a new anti-aging booster card and so that's done already
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.160]   just like I just showed you but now what I want to show you is now how would I
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.080]   upgrade my men's booster capsule with these new frequencies right and so it's
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.160]   really quite simple here are the two spermidines right so this is two and I'm
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.800]   and you know the reason I picked two is I just simply go by whatever the bottle
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.040]   says if the bottle says one servings one or two I just that's what I use when I
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.640]   put it in that's just what I did so I've already charged these guys for three
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.800]   minutes so they're fully charged so they won't take on the frequency of
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.880]   anything else you put in there so the first thing I want to do is in order to
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.720]   upgrade your capsule you want to put in your source frequencies fully charged
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.600]   right so there's the source frequencies for the upgrade of the anti-aging and
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.760]   then as I just showed you here's the source frequencies testosterone themselves
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:11.000]   cordyceps and Tonkot Ali supplements and there's the upgrade frequencies for
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.560]   the testosterone booster in the men's capsule here's the upgrade frequencies
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.000]   for the anti-aging booster in the men's capsule and then I cut up a bunch of
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.360]   little tiny pieces of foil I was like that I don't know just a bunch and I put
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.680]   them in there and hopefully the wind doesn't blow it away and what I'm going
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:33.720]   to do is put that in there for three minutes 30 seconds to burn the frequency
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.880]   you know it pretty much sets in there in two minutes three minutes is tops but
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.320]   the bottom line is now what's going to happen is the frequencies of the
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.280]   testosterone upgrade and the anti-aging upgrade are all going to burn on to
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.960]   those little pieces of foil and I'm going to use that to add it to my men's
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:58.840]   capsule as simple as that and to upgrade your capsule now this is my men's capsule
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.080]   which is my own creation my men's booster because I already had their
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.840]   frequency so when Layla Q came out and this is like the Layla Q you can see the
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.680]   difference of you know their men's capsule and their heel capsule are these
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.160]   bigger guys and so when they came out I already had the frequency so I went and
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.800]   bought a capsule and anyone can do this if you have a frequency and you have a
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.800]   cube lock go ahead and get your own capsule and and I went with brass and
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.800]   so these are brass with titanium spheres and so this is my my version of
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.880]   the men's capsule and all you do is you just take one of those little pieces of
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.320]   foil not every one of those foil right these pieces of foil have the
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.120]   frequencies of the additional supplements for the anti-aging into
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.960]   testosterone and then I've just put it all in a piece of foil and I add it to
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.640]   the capsule and that's it and then it's it's in there for now it's part of the
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.720]   men's capsule or my men's capsule and so now I've upgraded it it's as simple as
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.160]   that and so once you do that and you add the foil in there now all of the
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:08.280]   other frequencies of the men's booster is burnt into the capsule shell and then
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.880]   the additional frequencies are now in the foil and I've just upgraded my men's
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.520]   booster and that's how you do it that's the one way I'll show you the second way
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:23.960]   so the second way to upgrade a capsule is really quite simple you can if you
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:28.720]   don't have a cube lock you can use the spheres in your capsule they have enough
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.960]   quantum energy to actually transfer a frequency from a source to a piece of
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.360]   foil so what you need really is you need your heel capsule or you can use your
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.800]   men's capsule or woman's capsule but you need to get the spheres out and there's
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.200]   two things you're gonna need or three right you want to get like a three by
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.360]   three inch little piece of foil where you're gonna wrap the spheres inside and
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.600]   create kind of like a little Hershey's kiss so the easiest way to do that is I
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.560]   just kind of well it's kind of hard with one hand but I'm gonna just kind of
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.520]   show you where you put all five inside the foil and you make like a Hershey's
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.520]   kiss out of it I'm gonna show you in a second it's impossible to do with one
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.360]   hand and once you have this little packet you've got this tight little packet of
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:16.360]   titanium spheres with quantum energy in it and it has enough energy to then
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:22.760]   burn a source frequency into a target object or in this case the target is
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.720]   going to be this piece of foil so I would basically and I'm going to cut this up
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.360]   and wrap it around a sphere but basically I will fold this foil up and I'll show
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:37.880]   you here and then I'm gonna use that and I'm gonna burn the frequency of and in
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.880]   this example I'm gonna use the weight loss card so I'm gonna use the Layla
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:46.840]   weight loss sorry Layla weight loss card this is a great frequency by the way
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.560]   and so this is their new weight loss frequency and you could take the
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.920]   frequency off of a card and add it to a capsule okay so then you could upgrade
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.440]   your capsule so what I'm gonna do next is I'm gonna off-camera I'm gonna go ahead
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.680]   and and bunch this up into a tight little Hershey's kiss packet with the
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:10.280]   spheres inside and I'll show you how to do it okay real quick what you want to
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.200]   do is if out if you could see that it's four on the bottom and the fifth one in
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.920]   the middle on top of it and that's how you form your little pyramid okay so now
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.320]   what you want to do is now that you see this like you can see the outline of the
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.040]   balls right the spheres and so now I've got this little quantum energy packet
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.920]   and it's got enough strength as I said so you take your source and this source
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.440]   could be an essential oil drop you put right there on top of the foil it could
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.600]   be you could put some powder in there like if you want to do like vitamin C or
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.680]   an herb or anything anything you put on top of this thing and then you put the
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.840]   packet on then three minutes later it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.440]   basically burn in there so what you want to do is I want to basically put the
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:02.560]   frequency which is on the card on top of the foil and then put the packet on
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.800]   top now the packet energy is gonna go through the frequency card into that
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.360]   foil and you want to do that for I'm gonna check the time and then and verify
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:18.440]   that with you in a second all right my bad it was not 20 to 30 minutes according
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:23.640]   to Phillips video so if you want to you want to take that packet and leave it on
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.040]   the card to burn the foil right the frequency of the card which would be
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:33.960]   this card into the foil 30 minutes so 20 to 30 I always go with the higher
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.160]   number so it's definitely not three minutes that's if you're using the cube
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.400]   lock all right so my bad so you want to burn or let it sit let this packet sit
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.040]   on the card 30 minutes then you take that little piece of foil that's under the
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.120]   card which is now got the weight loss frequency in it or whatever card you're
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.360]   using right and then you would then take that little piece of foil from this guy
