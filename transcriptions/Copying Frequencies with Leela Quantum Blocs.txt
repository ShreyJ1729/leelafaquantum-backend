[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another tinker's academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and in this video
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'd like to share with you. This is a tutorial on how to copy frequencies
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.520]   using the Layla Quantum blocks. Now so I want to point out that there are other ways to do that
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:22.000]   with Layla tools. Primarily you can copy frequency with any of the blocks but you can also copy
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.120]   frequencies using the spheres that come with a capsule. So I'm only going to be talking about
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.880]   how to use blocks in this video and if you'd like to learn how to copy frequencies to add them to
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.960]   your super capsule which they now call the quantum capsule I have a video that I did make on how to
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.600]   do that specifically with using these spheres so and I put a link in the video description if you
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.240]   want to learn how to use spheres to copy frequencies specifically for the capsule but this video is
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.240]   only going to be about using the blocks okay. So the idea here about copying frequencies in the very
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.160]   you know baseline to start off with is to understand that there's three
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.600]   basic types of frequencies. The first one is the etheric frequencies and what those are is
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.960]   basically frequencies that are are from derived from manifestation of somebody's intent and we're
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.960]   talking that somebody's are these incredibly gifted individuals who have like the ability
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.760]   to take their manifested intent like love or abundance or prosperity you know you've seen those on the
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.360]   Leila quantum tech site also on quantum upgrade where you can see all the different frequencies
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.120]   well some of them which are like let's say the protection frequency or the cell and DNA protection
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.200]   frequency and those types of frequencies those are essentially a manifested intent that's been
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.240]   copied you know it's it's it's you know essentially you know anything that comes out of our mind is a
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.680]   frequency right so that frequencies of abundance for example is actually then captured using a block
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.040]   and then put into a card and then an and or made available through quantum upgrade and so those are
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:11.200]   it's a whole nother subject on how to do that and I'm not I'm basically not at all at that level
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.000]   yet where I'm able to do it I've been tinkering around we're trying to do that but I'm just I'm
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.760]   just not there yet and it just takes a really enlightened individual to be able to to basically
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.280]   pull that intention without adding anything from themselves so that's the purest form of that
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.240]   intention and then be able to put that into a to into an object so by far those are the most
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.440]   difficult frequencies to attempt to capture and then you know and then of course copying into
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.120]   devices if you were to do it yourself so the gifted level of people that can do that you know you
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.080]   can look at the Leila quantum tech healer network and those are some of the individuals that have
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.680]   been you know energy workers and clairvoyants and psychics and and those kinds of really gifted
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.240]   people that have been doing this stuff for like decades and they've basically tuned themselves
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.440]   to be able to do that so it's very difficult this is not that video on how to create etheric
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.400]   frequencies but I just wanted to point out that there are frequencies that come from people
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.000]   you know that are actually then essentially manifested in ten now the ones that you know us
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.240]   mere mortals kind of tinker around with are the other ones and the other second type of frequency
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.760]   is a molecular frequency which is the frequency of a physical substance now if you and this is
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.480]   traditional physics if you go on youtube and you just type in molecular frequencies you'll get
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.160]   thousands of pages of all of these physics with all the calculations in which they basically
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:45.200]   calculate what the frequency of any molecule or atomic you know substance might be and it's all
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   based on math and the math is basically you know the idea that anything that vibrates which is
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.920]   you know atoms all vibrate and when they all come together into molecules then all of these
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.880]   different atoms are vibrating at a different you know frequency combined into a molecule then the
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.120]   molecule then has this sort of harmonic frequency that it produces and so all of these things every
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.000]   single physical thing that you can touch and see and smell and look at have a molecular frequency
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.600]   so that means all of your supplements your medicines essential oils herbs things like that
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.080]   are essentially molecular because they're physical substances now those frequencies can be captured
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.760]   right and added to any type of object using a block and so if you're familiar with all of the
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.960]   different boosters that i've created that are available on both sites you know either as a card
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.440]   or capsule like for the men and women's booster and or they're available on the quantum upgrade i
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.560]   think under the calmer bundle but the idea though is i've compiled all of these different molecular
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.680]   substances together captured their frequencies and then put them into a frequency card and that's
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.360]   what i've done and they've actually worked quite well so the idea of a molecular frequency specific
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.760]   to let's say a supplement let's say you take a supplement like just like i did with the booster
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.520]   i took a whole bunch of different supplements that were really good for you know raising testosterone
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.880]   and i combined them all put them into a card created a booster that's actually been used to
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.320]   increase testosterone because of all of the different supplements it's sort of like taking the supplements
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.400]   you know by ingesting but instead you take it via frequency because you know you are an energy
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.000]   being and then you add that frequency to your bio field and it has the same type of effect
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.480]   especially when you start looking at things like the seasonal card which is basically for seasonal
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.800]   allergies you know the symptoms of seasonal allergies i took a bunch of molecular substances
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.440]   that were really good at handling those and then people have found them to be really helpful
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.960]   just to have that frequency and it helps them you know manage their symptoms you know during
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.920]   spring right when all the pollen is out so you know so that's the idea of molecular
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.920]   frequencies now i'm going to show you how to capture that that's the easiest thing to do
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.960]   you know it's capturing molecular frequencies by using physical things right supplements and so
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.760]   forth and if you have the physical thing it's really easy to capture and i'll show you how to do that
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.600]   now the third type of frequency is resonant frequencies it's the frequency that's emanated
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.240]   as sound and it's sound within your hearing and there's also sound that's outside of the you know
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.120]   the ability for the humans to hear but it's the entire range of audible acoustic sound and those
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.200]   were of frequencies as well are available either through you know you can actually get the sound
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.960]   of a molecular substance you know there are different i'll show you as a website where you can if you
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.920]   don't have this substance this is where it really comes in handy um if you've seen my how to make a
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.320]   booster video you'll know that i've spent up to a thousand dollars on all of the different supplements
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.640]   that went into the men's and the woman's a booster uh because back in the old days when i first started
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.200]   this i was buying all of the different supplements but i've since learned about a site that actually
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.720]   sells them sells the frequency for you know for a real cheap price uh subscription and you can
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.360]   download all of the different frequencies from different molecular substances so things that are
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.640]   like really hard to get which you know typically are substances that are just going to be super
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.440]   expensive or very hard to get like let's say you know like the i've been working on a booster
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:34.080]   for third eye awakening and i wanted to capture the frequency of ayahuasca and peyote and some of
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.040]   these things that you know open your third eye and you know obviously those are substances that
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.080]   are hard to find and so i just went to this site and grabbed the molecular frequency for ayahuasca
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.960]   also for peyote and you name it and then they have the frequencies and you can go ahead and grab
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:55.280]   molecular frequencies as sound or if you have the physical thing you can use you know you can use
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.360]   that right but if you don't have the physical thing you can then get the molecular frequency
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.600]   already you know as a sound and you can use that to copy and put onto a card or your own booster
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.120]   so forth now there's also another group of frequencies that i call divine the divine frequencies are
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.680]   some pretty interesting frequencies they come they come from ancient knowledge some of them come
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.720]   from different religious practices others come from just you know like ancient wisdom like the
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.680]   Tibetan singing bolts they all have different frequencies and are all meant to open up different
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.680]   chakras things like that there's divine frequencies called the sulfegio and those come from things
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.200]   like gregorian chants and things like that so there's some really cool divine frequencies that are
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:43.040]   available that you can also capture and put into a card or you can you know as if you just want to
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:49.280]   use your block if you make a frequency card then you can put that frequency in your block and emanate
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:55.360]   it throughout the field that the block encompasses and or you can make a foil and put it in a capsule
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.480]   and wear it around or you can put that frequency into anything like jewelry you name it so you know
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.720]   it's kind of cool how you can capture these frequencies specifically sound because sound
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:11.280]   really opens up this entire new kind of like you know source of frequencies you could use
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.000]   that you could copy and use with your blocks now the other one through the third one is a sound
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.080]   healing now there are some really interesting people out in the world that are actually
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:30.480]   quite gifted and they've made some pretty interesting recordings of of frequencies that they've discovered
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:37.840]   that will help a particular issue that you're having whether it's trauma or illness or disease
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:43.520]   or ill you know all sorts of different things and they've discovered the sound you know the frequency
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:50.560]   of of of the treatment for that you know or the cure for that issue and they've embedded that into
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.640]   music and so I'll show you some of those as well and and those all fall under the world of you know
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.360]   what I consider sound healing and these are people who sell who sell or provide music tracks and
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.560]   sound tracks that are for all the different things you could come up with and some of them are based
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.080]   on just doing a diagnostics of your own voice and your voice that you know the frequency of your
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.840]   voice they have a way to and you know basically diagnose what what you sound like and then they
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.720]   from that they can diagnose what would help you you know it's it's real interesting and then the
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:31.200]   fourth one is frequency medicine this is old school this kind of kind of stems from frequency
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.520]   medicine different from the other three from the standpoint it kind of was created a little
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:42.000]   over a hundred years ago it started out with a guy named dr. Royal Raymond Reif who discovered
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.920]   that frequencies could be used to eradicate several different you know diseases and which the frequency
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:55.840]   that he discovered through years and years of experimenting where he could find that a specific
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:03.120]   frequency when played to a pathogen would cause the pathogen to implode just like you would you
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.400]   know your typical opera singer and the wine glass and the opera singer hits that you know is that
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.080]   specific note and the glass shatters well there's that same thing applies to living organisms
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.920]   if you can find the right frequency then you can basically blast some type of pathogens every
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:26.560]   pathogen has its own frequency by which it'll just self-destruct and so Raymond Reif basically
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:34.000]   called those things Moors MOR where he discovered through literally 30 40 years of experimenting
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.040]   where he discovered the more the more frequency which stands for molecular oscillating or sorry
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:47.600]   mortal oscillatory rate which means the frequency he discovered that would eliminate a pathogen
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:53.920]   and that just started with him and so from that there have been just a whole group of individuals
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:01.040]   who've taken the concept of using the acoustic frequencies and using that to treat issues
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:07.600]   and the issues are just an endless list of things that you could have possibly you know your suffering
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:13.200]   from and the frequencies that have been discovered and are being experimented with in terms of using
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.400]   those frequencies to treat that issue so here you know as a really simple example I mean just
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.120]   any one of the different diseases or illness states you know you can find a frequency that
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.160]   matches to that you can capture that frequency put it in a card where to run with you so that not
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:34.400]   only are you you know doing your typical whatever process you go through for health treatment but
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.680]   then you can also approach it from the frequency standpoint as well so those are the three types
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.640]   of frequencies out there so let's talk about how do you capture these frequencies now i'm going to
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:50.160]   leave out a theory because you know there's a theory means you create it okay but the other two you
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:56.720]   can go out and get and then you could use those frequencies by copying them onto a card or anything
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.000]   and then use that frequency in your with your blocks and with your capsules as stated so the
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.040]   first one i want to talk about is just a molecular frequencies this is again the easiest thing to
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.080]   do so if you've seen some of the tutorials that Philip and i have created you'll notice that we do
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:18.640]   have a a time frame for every single type of block there's a time frame for how long it takes to copy
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:24.880]   a frequency using that block and it's pretty standard where the cube block which is the quantum block
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.880]   is 30 to 60 seconds for more stuff except for pharmaceuticals it's 45 seconds and then homeopathy
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.960]   there's no recommend you can't there's the recommendation is you don't try to copy
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:41.200]   homeopathy remedy because of the way that it's structured but everything else you can actually
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.800]   copy those frequencies then put them into a card or so forth now the i block the travel block and
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.360]   the ground block it's 10 to 20 seconds and of course there's it's highly recommended you don't
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:57.840]   use those to try to copy pharmaceuticals or homeopathy but they're the blocks those three blocks are
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:03.680]   just so strong that you don't want to do that and we can talk a little bit more about that i actually
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:13.200]   think that it's okay to use these blocks to copy a pharmaceutical and just don't uh with the concept
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.560]   of you don't plan to take that pill you know let's just take one of your pills and use that as a
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:24.960]   copy source uh and then don't take it because it does the reason that the recommendation is to
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:30.400]   not use pharmaceuticals with the stronger blocks is because the stronger blocks will
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:36.880]   transmute the the chemicals in the pharmaceutical and or it will transmute the homeopathy remedy and
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.840]   it'll change it from its original purpose which you may or may not want to do in other words you
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:47.200]   don't want to put that in a block expose it and then take it because not once you take it after
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:53.360]   it's been in a block it's not the same thing it's not the same chemical you know it's well i don't
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.320]   want to get into it but it's it's not it may not have the same effect okay and that's the concept
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:02.640]   because it's been transmuted by the energy in the block but with the quantum block the quantum block
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:08.800]   is the is the lowest strength block which is perfect for copying frequencies but again you can use
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.760]   the other three blocks for copying frequencies no problem just follow the guidelines here on the
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:20.720]   timings so it's really an easy thing it's a it's a four-step process basically number step one
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.760]   is the first thing you want to do is now if you want to you know if you let's say other than
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.800]   pharmaceuticals so supplements essential oils plants and herbs if you want to copy
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.840]   one of those things then you really and you plan on taking it like you don't want to throw it away
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.760]   when you're done if you don't want to throw it away when you're done then what you want to do
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.960]   is step one is you want to seal your source your source is your frequency source where you know
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.520]   what you're copying from and you want to seal it by charging it in your block so you want to go
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:55.280]   ahead and take a look at the charging times uh you know graph and the links everything on everything
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.600]   i'm talking about today will be in the video description there's a ton of links in there for
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:04.880]   all this stuff so you want to make sure that you charge it a full charge so for example a quantum
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.360]   block a full charge is three minutes so you want to just seal it in other words you want to basically
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.000]   charge it to full strength so i would take the supplement charge it to full strength
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.240]   so that i don't copy the frequency of the aluminum card onto the supplement that i plan on taking
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.560]   see what i'm saying so if you don't because it goes both ways whatever you put in that block
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.840]   they're going to copy to each other so unless it's sealed unless it's already been charged once
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:35.840]   it's been charged it can't take on the frequency uh you know uh you know from inside of a block so
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:41.520]   you want to seal it uh charge it fully and then step two is then you would place your source
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.560]   your charged source right it's now been sealed and the target object which in a lot of cases is
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:51.520]   the metal card that you want to put the frequency on and you want to put that together in the block
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:57.440]   for the time uh specified right here in this chart so 30 to 60 seconds and then step three is
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:03.760]   you want to remove the source after the allotted time noted above right so after 60 seconds you take
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:10.880]   out the source and then you leave the card in there step four uh for to get a full charge so then you
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.760]   want to seal your target right your your target object and you want to seal it by leaving it in
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:21.280]   the block for a full charge so then i'll show you what i mean and so that way you've got a card that
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.480]   ends up having the frequency on it fully charged and sealed and it holds the frequency when you're
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.680]   done okay so let me kind of walk you through doing that uh let me go ahead and show you what i just
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:38.560]   was doing this this morning um i'm just taking this uh tomcat alley which is a supplement for
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:44.240]   testosterone and hormone and i basically put it in the block to seal it so first thing i do is i put
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.760]   the supplement in the cue block now this is a cue block if you were doing this with the other
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.240]   blocks pay attention to the time frames and so then i want to put it in there for a full three
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:00.960]   minutes okay then once it's finished after three minutes then it's sealed and now i can basically
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.880]   put the frequency so these are just the charge times right here i was i so if you're copying
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:14.080]   frequencies uh that's the 30 to 60 seconds as noted above in the other graph so that's how long i'm
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.480]   gonna put it in there okay so that's how long i mean i'm gonna leave it in there in other words i
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:25.920]   put the source and then i put the target right so now i'm taking the target which is the the card so
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:34.560]   i'm copying the frequency of the supplement onto the card the copy time frame is max 60 seconds so
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:40.880]   i'm gonna then step two right i'm putting it in there together for 60 seconds and then once 60
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:47.680]   seconds is over i take the supplement out and then of course and because it's sealed it didn't pick
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:53.120]   up the frequency of the aluminum card but then i leave the card in for another two full minutes
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:59.200]   so that the card gets a full three minutes okay so that's really it and that's once those uh
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:04.000]   two other minutes is done the card now has been in the block for a full three minutes
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.520]   and now i have a frequency card for toncat alley so again i just want to say you want to
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:15.520]   seal your source place them both in there together right leave it in there leave the source in there
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:21.600]   for the allotted time 60 seconds take the source out leave the card in for another two minutes and
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.800]   you're done and that's just basically specific to the quantum block so that's really how you copy
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:32.160]   a molecular frequency and depending on the block you have different time frames but mainly this is
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.640]   just how it goes it's pretty simple now i do want to point out something about copying frequencies
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:42.160]   off of lela cards because lela cards whether you know whether it's molecular or whatever type of
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:48.720]   frequencies on that card it's a frequency source so now i if you've if you've ever been in the uh
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.400]   the chat group on telegram you'll know that i talk a lot about just use a piece of foil and what i
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.920]   mean by using a piece of foil is the way i look at the lela cards is you paid quite a bit of money
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.880]   for them uh and you don't want to mess them up right and so uh no matter what block you're using
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:10.720]   you you just really don't want to mess them up so i treat my lela cards as like a master copy okay i
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:17.280]   don't the day i get it what i do is i take the frequency i use a q block right but you could use
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.520]   your other blocks as long as you don't overcharge that card okay you stick to the time frames that's
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:26.720]   the key thing so i take the card and i'm put it on and i take the frequency and i put it on a piece
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:32.240]   of foil okay and then whenever i need to use that frequency i just use the piece of foil i keep my
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:38.080]   cards separate and secure and safe so that they never get overcharged and or i don't lose them
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:43.200]   or you know misplace them or whatever you can you know there's been lots of folks that lose these
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.240]   things but the idea though is i take the frequency off of the card using the steps i just mentioned
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:54.640]   the above i put it on a frequency foil and that way i avoid the copy effect and the copy effect is
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:00.720]   if you use the card every single time in one of those stronger blocks it's going to get overcharged
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:06.000]   over time and if it gets overcharged over time the card then it's going to cause something called
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.160]   the copy effect and it's going to mess up your other cards if you store them together then it
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.800]   becomes kind of a pain in the butt to store all the cards and when things get overcharged you want
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:20.160]   to keep them when they're never overcharged that's why i don't mess with my cards i just you make a
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:24.720]   copy and i use the foil now if the foil is good overcharged no big deal i throw them away and make
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:29.120]   another one all right and that's the key thing i don't have to hassle we're trying to figure out
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:34.480]   how much time is on each one of my cards i can just use the foil whenever i want to if i want to like
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:40.320]   put it in the block put it in a super capsule and so forth so now the thing about copying your
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:46.560]   frequency cards um is in onto some onto another object like jewelry and whatever you don't have
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:52.320]   to do step one because it's already been sealed the cards come from uh layla uh sealed so basically
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.200]   you would just go straight to play uh step two place the two things in the block together remove
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.000]   your source after the allotted time which would be the piece of foil and then leave the card or the
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.160]   jewelry or keys or whatever you're charging and leave it in there for the full charge and just
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:11.840]   you know you can get the full charge off the off the chart okay so that's how to copy a molecular
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.880]   frequency also how to you know use take frequencies off of laylo now the other one here is about
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:22.240]   copying resonant frequencies now of course you're now you're copying sounds so how do you do that
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.760]   and it's really quite simple it's it's an actual practice that you know people have wrapped business
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.080]   models around and this thing's been around for years and years and years it predates layla quantum
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:38.560]   tech because it's the concept called imprinting and so if you want to imprint a frequency onto
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:43.920]   water and this was way before layla was around you know you can basically use all sorts of different
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.000]   different ways where you could take a frequency put it into water and then people would drink the
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.720]   water to get that frequency right and so it's imprinting to water and that's really what you're
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:58.800]   doing you're taking a sound you're capturing it in water and then using that water as the source
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:04.560]   of the frequency because the water will capture the frequency and this is science and so if you've
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:12.160]   ever taken a look at there's a book out there called hidden messages and water it's by the
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:19.600]   I think emoto I'm sorry I forgot the name of the author but it's the emoto institute in
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.880]   japan and they basically did studies back in the 70s and they're still around where they
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:33.840]   basically proved that sound can be captured by water and they prove that water retains a memory
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.800]   because what is water it's a liquid crystal and what crystals are used throughout tons and tons
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:44.880]   of different electronics as capturing information so you can use water to capture it and it'll hold
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:50.080]   that memory of that frequency and it's all proven with science okay so it's called imprinting so
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:55.760]   you want to imprint a frequency that you want and you want to put it down to water and then use
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:02.960]   water so step one would be you just want to play the sound to a glass of purified or distilled water
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:08.160]   for three minutes if it's just a tone or for the full track if you let's say it's a full track of
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.880]   music all right and that's as long as you need to do it and then step two is you would then use the
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:19.200]   glass of water as the frequency source and following the molecular copying steps it's as simple as that
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:24.080]   so all the steps I just showed you earlier instead of the actual supplement you'd play sound to the
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:29.520]   water and then use the water as the as the you know supplement right the key thing though is don't
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:36.080]   use a metal cup all right don't use paper and use a new class so this is straight from philip
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:41.840]   basically the way that they capture at Leila quantum tech is I think they use like Fiji water
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.240]   you know it's just some kind of purified water right I use distilled water because I just
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:52.400]   have access to it and so I just use a glass with distilled water in it I use a new glass every time
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:58.720]   which is the only big pain in the ucola that you have to deal with is that the glass itself right
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:04.240]   will retain the frequency and so if you don't want to blend frequencies then use a new glass
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:10.400]   each time you do this and you're good to go all right so let me kind of show you what that's all
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:17.280]   about and I'll just kind of walk you through that so this is an example of me capturing the
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:25.280]   divinity sound from 111 hertz so the first thing I'm going to do is I set up I have a before I
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:31.360]   get in there I have a Bose speaker so one of the things too and I'm using my phone my phone my
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.400]   phone's got a bluetooth connection to my Bose mini sound deckers whatever they're called and the
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:42.400]   reason I use this is I don't I got to kind of a mediocre cell phone it's not a fancy iPhone
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:47.760]   or anything and I don't trust the speakers on it to carry the tone accurately so I went and got
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:54.560]   myself this little mini Bose speaker it's a bluetooth speaker so that I know that the town is pure
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.840]   if you if you're familiar with Bose you'll know that Bose is like literally the Cadillac of speakers
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:05.280]   and sound and so that way I know that the sound coming off of my Bose speaker instead of the speakers
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:10.480]   of my phone is going to be accurate you know it's going to be like tuned right into that
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.960]   specific frequency that I want because of the high quality of the sound device I'm using
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:20.560]   I don't I just I just personally don't trust the speakers on my phone so anyway so I get my
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:26.640]   mini Bose speaker bluetooth connect to my phone and I go to this online tone generator okay
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:33.120]   because I want to I want to copy a very specific frequency of 111 and that's that's actually a
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:39.360]   frequency from divinity it's a healing frequency and it's just you know I don't want to get into
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.880]   it but it's a very special frequency for healing and so then I turn on the frequency you can hear
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.520]   it there in the background playing to the water and I just want to play it for three minutes because
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:55.840]   it's just a tone so I turn the thing on for three minutes and as soon as it's over I turn off the
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:03.520]   tone okay and I'm done boom as soon as I hit the turn that thing off once the three minutes is over
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:09.120]   I hit stop on the tone generator which is an online tone generator and now that little glass
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.000]   of water here it's glass of distilled water and I've never used this before I've only used it
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.440]   in this one time and now that becomes the source so that water is now holding 111 hertz frequency
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:27.920]   so I put the card in and I set it for three minutes I let it go ahead and copy over now in this case
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:32.320]   the reason I'm going to go for the full three minutes right off the bat is I'm not planning to
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.640]   drink the water so what I'm saying so I'm not worried that the aluminum is going on to the
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:43.360]   water it doesn't matter to me so I've just basically got the frequency of the water which is 111 hertz
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:50.400]   but I've now copied it onto a card and I now have a card of 111 hertz and that's it that's as easy
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.120]   as it gets so the key though is you I just want to say one more time is use a fresh glass every
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:00.640]   time three minutes for the tone or the full track if it's uh if it's going to be a musical piece
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:06.480]   and again use purified or distilled water okay so that's how you capture resonant frequencies so
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.240]   now the thing about frequencies and I just want to kind of stipulate a couple things here I think
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:19.280]   it's important to know is that frequency medicine is again it's using frequencies to treat conditions
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:24.880]   okay and so they come in three different flavors and I want to kind of talk you through how to use
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:31.280]   those different you know flavors right of frequency because each one is going to require a little
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:36.720]   bit of different kind of dinking around so first of all you can have if you're trying to capture a
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:43.760]   single frequency like a like a chakra frequency or a or which are the which are the you know the
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:50.640]   Tibetan bowl singing bowl frequencies or the sofegio frequencies for DNA repair or love right all
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:56.320]   these different numbers they're all very specific single numbers if you got a single frequency like
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:02.880]   111 then it's basically you can just use a tone generator as you saw in the demonstration okay so
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:08.640]   you just there's online tone generators video description links to all that stuff in the video
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:14.640]   description okay so you can just play one single tone now sometimes you might need to do a sweep
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:21.760]   and so I was working on a frequency booster for plant growth and I was doing some research and I
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.400]   found this one that there's a frequency that you know was studied by scientists and they've
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:34.800]   discovered that they could get plants to grow stronger faster better using a frequency's sweep
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:40.800]   and then what they mean by sweep is they said basically they used frequencies from 3,000 to 5,000
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:47.280]   hertz okay so that's three to five kilohertz and so now that's not a single number that's every
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:53.120]   number from 3,000 3,000 1 3,000 2 all the way up to 5,000 so how would you possibly play
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:30:00.080]   all of those frequencies at you know to a glass of water well there's online generators that are
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.880]   called sweep generators and you can set this the beginning you know the beginning and the ending
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:10.080]   frequency and then it'll play that whole thing to your little glass of water so you can actually
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:16.960]   capture a range of frequencies when when you run into that and that range of frequencies then
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:22.000]   could be then all captured using a sweep generator so you could use the sweep generator to play
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.520]   a range so you can use a tone generator to play a single number right a certain frequency or you
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:33.040]   can use a sweep generator to play a range now there's also this third flavor called multiple
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.480]   frequencies so if you when we look at and I'm going to go ahead and look at where you can you
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.720]   know there's a whole list of where you can find frequencies now some frequencies are some
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:47.920]   ailments in fact a lot of ailments and conditions health conditions have been discovered that you
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:54.560]   know they require multiple different frequencies like five to ten or twenty different frequencies
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:59.360]   right and if you and so it's not just one frequency is going to do it it's just you know we're talking
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.160]   about decades and decades and decades of people tinkering around and trying to figure out what
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:09.920]   works for what and they discovered that if you play these seven frequencies then it'll help XYZ
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:14.480]   you know whatever that problem might be and so when you have multiple frequencies this is where
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.840]   it gets complicated it's not for the average Joe because the equipment there is I've been looking
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:26.880]   and by the way if you know of one an online tone generator that can play multiple frequencies
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:31.120]   please leave comments in the video just in the comments for the video because I have not been
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:36.720]   able to find one so what I do for that though because I'm I'm my background is in biological
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:43.600]   magnetics is I've got Rife equipment and you know attributed to Dr. Royal Raymond Rife and Rife
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:49.120]   equipment are basically actual frequency generators that within the way that they operate you can
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.480]   program X number of frequencies you can actually play all 12 and it's just going to go one after
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.960]   another boom boom boom boom and play all of those different frequencies they're not in a row so
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.120]   you're not going to be able to sweep them but you can play seven or eight different frequencies in a
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:09.760]   row using a frequency generator and so if you're really interested in doing that then you know
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:15.120]   there's a really good the cheapest one out there that's the most effective is from a company called
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:20.880]   spooky 2 the cheap generator there is called the xm xm generator I've actually got this one under
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:26.240]   200 bucks for the whole thing uh softwares for free then of course there's the I own this one as
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:31.280]   well the GB 4000 generator and you can program up to eight different frequencies and you can
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:36.480]   program sweeps and you can program single frequencies using actual frequency generators you know buying
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:41.920]   hardware I'm trying to keep it simple for you guys most of you are like myself well I guess not
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.760]   not like myself but most of you are just not like you know basically regular variable you're not
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.720]   going to have all this equipment you're going to have a phone you're going to have a laptop you
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:54.080]   know or a computer and with that you can access tone generators and sweep generators so the key
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.960]   thing though is if you have multiple frequencies it is a little tricky and so then what I would
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:03.920]   recommend is you try to find you know let you try to find the frequency for your element I'll
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.760]   show you where you can find it so that you don't have to go out and buy the equipment if you don't
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:13.840]   really really need to there is a way to find these things because spooky has done the world a great
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:20.240]   favor by recording a ton of their different frequency sets onto their youtube page or you can go
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.000]   there and I'll show you that in a second okay so you can actually grab those types of frequencies
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.880]   right off the spooky to a youtube page you know if you want to if they have it if they don't
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.960]   you might have to you know buy your own generator if you're specifically trying to target
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:38.320]   something they haven't actually published yet otherwise it is difficult to play multiple frequencies
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.640]   without having an actual generator and then the other thing too now about frequency medicine
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:47.840]   is like what are you know what are the output methods for getting the frequency from you know
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:55.200]   from a generator to a glass of water and so like I was showing you in the demonstration just earlier
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.600]   is through speakers now the speakers are the easiest way to do it but there are other ways to
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:05.040]   do that and I just want to point that out there are other ways to do frequency medicine and so in
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:10.080]   other words you could use speakers you can use plasma antennas which you know which comes with
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:14.720]   these two guys if you buy rife equipment there's you know you can you can output the sound
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:21.120]   the frequency through plasma antennas you could output the frequency through a pmf wand you could
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:25.600]   output the frequencies through light wands and also throughout a scalar field so if you have
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.560]   a scalar field generator you can also do it that way but you know these last four are not your
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.560]   average joe but I just want to point out that there's different ways where you could output a
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:41.040]   frequency to water I actually played around with all of these and but the speakers are the easiest
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.920]   and that's kind of what I recommend so again there's three different types of frequencies right
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:52.240]   three different sorry flavors of frequencies when it comes to resonant frequencies and depending on
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:58.240]   which type you're going to need to use a different doodad to play that frequency to water and I also
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:04.320]   want to say one more thing too about speakers and this is really important okay guys if you're
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:10.320]   going to be using speakers to basically transmit a frequency to water you have that you know there's
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:15.440]   a there's a warning here that I want to give you or because it's possibly it's possible you could
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:21.600]   damage your hearing you know if your speakers play tones at extreme volumes and the problem with that
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:27.920]   is that you know you can't hear anything that's under 20 hertz and greater than 10,000 hertz okay
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.800]   so if you can't hear it but it's still turned on you could still damage your hearing so what you
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:38.720]   want to do is to be safe you want to make sure that you first try out your speakers at volume level
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:43.840]   that you know is comfortable for you to listen to right and set it to a thousand and if you can
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:50.960]   hear that tone comfortably without discomfort then you just leave that volume alone and then play
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:56.400]   these other volumes that you cannot hear because if you play a volume you cannot hear at full blast
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.160]   and you're too close to the speaker or worse you're wearing headsets you could damage your
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:06.080]   hearing okay so be careful about that and just so again make sure to be safe set your volume on
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:11.760]   your speaker to 1,000 hertz play it where it's comfortable and then don't touch the volume knob
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:16.640]   after that for this for the frequencies you're going to copy okay now lastly where do you find
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:22.720]   these frequencies so if you go into the video description below then you'll find that I've got
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.200]   frequencies for that molecular that's that site I was talking about if you don't have the substance
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:32.000]   but you want to go ahead and get the frequency I believe it's like 995 a month subscription and
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.440]   you have full access to their entire database and they actually are water imprinting devices that
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:42.080]   they sell as well so if you just you know info path these are pretty cool site where you can just
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:48.080]   basically you know they sell this gizmos where you can take the sound from info pathi for anything
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:52.480]   that they sell they got this giant library of molecular frequencies and then you could basically
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:57.760]   put that right into water and drink the water that's their thing you know but you know my whole
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:03.520]   thing is I just want access to the frequencies and you know I put it into objects and not just water
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:10.240]   and then of course there's I have sites listed for divine and then for sound sound healing and also
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:14.720]   for frequency medicine so kind of walking you through some of these things well here's
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:21.360]   basically info pathi and you can see all the different this is their library and so if I want
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:26.560]   to put in one like let's say I want to put in I don't even know how to spell ayasu so let me
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:35.120]   just put in something simple like vitamin C if I don't have any vitamin C on me or even better
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:40.240]   like peptides peptides are super expensive so like here you go vitamin C you can and it's right in
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:45.040]   their library you can grab a copy of what that sounds like and you know I'll tell you what if
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:51.120]   you have if you're like me and you kind of tinker around with different substances one of the most
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:56.400]   expensive substances to get are peptides and so I just want to show you that they've got tons of
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:02.400]   peptides so here's the BPC 157 peptide and here they've got the molecular frequency for it right
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:06.880]   there on their site you don't have to go and buy it it is expensive so if you don't you know it
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.800]   really is going to save you a lot of money if you're trying to put together something and you
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:15.760]   want the molecular frequency but you don't have to pay a lot more than just 10 bucks a month for
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:20.960]   a subscription so that's a really good idea for that now in terms of like the sofegios just as an
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:26.720]   example this is one example of divine frequencies but here's this is a link in the video description
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.360]   you know like what are they kind of describes what the sofegios are how they came about again
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:36.560]   their divinity and then here's the numbers right so if you want to do like 396 liberating guilt
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:42.640]   and fear understanding you know 417 undoing situations and facilitating change and then of
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:49.040]   course 528 the frequency of love it's for transformation and miracles and so forth so these types of
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:54.560]   incredible divinity type of frequencies are available here's the number and you would just use a tone
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:59.680]   generator or better yet you just go right onto youtube and find somebody who created a video of
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:05.760]   that now in terms of frequency medicine there's different lists of frequencies that are in the
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:10.960]   video description that i've provided and so one of them is called the nojir frequency it's a doctor
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:16.720]   nojir i don't know how long ago but this doctor basically did a lot of experimentation and came up
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:22.160]   with his seven frequencies so he's got frequencies where he discovered the the frequency through
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:29.120]   experimentation of 73 Hertz would help and support the endocrine system one he's got a
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:37.520]   frequency for inflammation ectodermal tissue healing endo endo dermal and then of course chronic
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.240]   conditions general pain so forth so you know as a real interesting thing you know dr nojir discovered
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:48.960]   that the 4698 Hertz frequency helps with pain and so he's actually you know he and there's
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.520]   devices out there that play the nojir frequencies that you can get but then you know here you go
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:58.080]   you know that 5698 Hertz is going to be for general pain where you can put that in a tone
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:04.000]   generator play it to water put it on a card and now you've got a general pain you know relief
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.920]   frequency card and that's that's kind of why i do all this stuff another frequency medicine
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:17.280]   list is called the consolidated annotated frequency list it's always being updated and here's where
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:24.240]   i was talking about where you've got a condition that requires numerous different numbers
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:29.520]   okay so let's just say abdominal inflammation or just i mean this thing this is a huge one here's
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:35.040]   one for things like i just saw Alzheimer's right so you take a look at Alzheimer's right
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.040]   and there's and so it's like okay you want to combine all of these different frequencies
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.760]   and this is where it gets tricky this is the multiple frequencies so i want to treat Alzheimer's
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.600]   aren't you know i want to make a frequency and put it on super capsule give it to somebody i
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:54.720]   know that's got Alzheimer's well the trick is you got to capture 430 620 620 480 866 blah blah
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.800]   all these different frequencies would go all into quote a Alzheimer's booster
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.440]   play it to the water put it on a card or put it on a piece of foil and then give it to that person
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:08.000]   right but this is where you have multiple frequencies that you are using for frequency medicine
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.040]   where it gets a little tricky and this is why i brought that up because a lot of the quote frequency
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:18.800]   medicine you know you know sets or things like that are you as you could see that have lots of
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:25.200]   different frequencies to treat a specific condition okay so that's where you you'll find all you know
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:30.320]   a list of just a ton of different things i mean i mean i mean pretty much everything you think of
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:36.080]   everything from cancer to diabetes you name it's in this list okay so that's this list but that's
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:40.400]   again that falls into that little weird thing where you've got multiples and you may need to
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:46.560]   get a frequency but again i'll show you one more thing in case you get lucky let's say you really
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:51.600]   want to use something that has multiple frequencies in it but you don't have a frequency generator
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:56.960]   then go to the spooky two right link in the video description uh youtube page okay and what
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:01.600]   they've done is they've been doing this for years where they're in between their other videos like
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:06.160]   you know all this stuff that they do they've got healing frequency for cluster headaches
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:13.040]   healing frequency for chicken pox healing frequency for goiter goiter conjunctivitis
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:19.120]   they've got one in here for ataxia whatever that is they've got frequencies for gout
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.840]   for demas for stomach ulcers you can see where this is going right so they've got different
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:29.200]   all right here's i don't you know pork tatitis i don't know what that is but anyway so if you
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:35.200]   go to this website and you just go hey i want the frequency for um you know i'm suffering from
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:41.760]   uh let's see uh cankrum or someone get one that's normal i got a boil here's a
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:46.400]   breast enhancement here you know i want to do a healing for breast enhancement and then i would
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:52.800]   just go ahead and play this frequency and i've got the volume at full and so it's one of those
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.440]   frequencies that humans can't hear but it is playing and they'll be playing through your speakers
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:02.000]   okay so that's one way to do it and that's the you know the easy way to do it is hopefully somebody's
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.800]   recorded it for you and you just go ahead and grab it and again too it's not just spooky other people
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:11.520]   have gone out there and created frequencies and put them on youtube um so just make sure you
[00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.120]   have good speakers and maybe you could find it on youtube you know if you have one of these things
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:19.440]   where tons tons of different frequency numbers but anyway that's one way to get at me just in case
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:24.320]   you know you don't have a frequency generator so again here's the online tone generator
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:30.880]   it plays just one at a time you saw me use this in my uh in my demonstration you would just type
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:35.680]   in whatever frequency you want let's say i want to do the frequency of love five twenty eight i play
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.520]   and then it's going to it's going to go ahead and play and then of course you know the three
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:44.480]   minutes and of course if i want to do a sweep here's a sweep generator uh and then i would say okay i
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:51.520]   want to do three thousand to start and i want to end at five thousand go ahead and play i want it to
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:57.040]   play i want it to just be ten seconds each and then i've got different choices for waves i just use
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:02.720]   sine wave as a default and then i go ahead and play and that's annoying as hell but there you go
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:07.600]   okay and so then that plays the range it's a sweep generator so that's kind of how all these
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:13.760]   tools work so everything i've mentioned today is all in the video description for ways that you can
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:19.600]   go ahead and uh you can you know where you know where you can find frequencies for almost anything
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:25.680]   you can think up there's either a divinity frequency or a molecular frequency or sound healing or
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:30.240]   frequency medicine that can help with that situation and the situation doesn't need to be
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:36.720]   physical it could be you know uh all sorts of things like you know like wealth prosperity
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:41.040]   blah blah right i mean do well in school all that stuff uh but you know you could probably find
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.520]   it if you went looking and here's all the different places where you can go and find frequencies
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:51.680]   then put it in water then copy it to a card and that's how you copy frequencies so there you go
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:55.440]   thank you very much for listening i hope you enjoyed this this little mini tutorial if you
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.120]   got any questions now i know there'll always be questions you can always find me at the tickers
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:04.960]   academy blog uh and links below and also too we have a health and healing uh you know telegram
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:09.440]   chat group we're doing this kind of stuff is par for the course so anyway if you want to reach
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:13.600]   me you can find me here otherwise you can drop in and just ask questions in the quantum power
