[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and in this
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.720]   video I'd like to share with you my research in bio-magnetics. Now what I mean by that is it's
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.600]   simply the idea for a health and healing purpose to use magnets and is that possible? What's the
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.080]   research on that? What are people doing? How do you do it? Where do you find magnets and all of those
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.520]   kinds of questions are going to be held in this video? So if that's the kind of thing that
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.320]   interests you then hey this is the right video for you and for those of you who are on the weird side
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.360]   and you think hey you know I always wondered how to raise cannibalistic chickens and or maybe
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.120]   improve my sex life this is also your video so come along for the right. Now before I get started I
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.240]   do have a couple of disclaimers first and foremost all information contained in this videos for
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.520]   educational purposes only and should not be construed as medical advice. I also have no
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.680]   affiliation to any of the products discussed or any of the websites that I'm going to share
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.240]   so not a marketing thing. The other thing too is that the information contained in this video
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:07.200]   is public information and is presented under fair use. Now as it relates to biomagnetic therapy
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.000]   I do want to make sure that everyone he understands you know is that there's three basic forms of
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.360]   it so there's three different branches of this one you know science okay. The first one is the
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.360]   healing hands and so that's using your own magnetic field of your own body and using that to you
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.960]   know and putting your hands on people the whole quote laying of hands for healing purposes and
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.400]   that's that's one branch of biomagnetic therapy. Another branch of biomagnetic therapy is called
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.720]   pair therapy where you're using a two different magnets and you're using that on people's bodies
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.560]   so that's a whole another branch and it's not what this video is about which is the third form
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.200]   which is simply magnet therapy but I do want to do a quick shout out for anyone who's interested
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.880]   in biomagnetic biomagnetic pair therapy which was really the founder of that was Dr. Isaac
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.400]   Goes Duran and now he's got a website I'll link that to the video description below but you know
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.400]   he's basically the pioneer behind biomagnetic pair therapy and on his web page right here the
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.360]   very you know right here on the very bottom it says what is magnet therapy versus biomagnetic
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.360]   pair therapy so it's all kind of you know it's all right here it's all discussed right here it's a
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.400]   great reference if you're interested in that form and so you know the thing about too though if you
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.120]   go on to on the Amazon and you type in biomagnets like you're trying to you know if you want to buy
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.120]   one then it's going to show you what people use for biomagnetic pair therapy and that's all it shows
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.080]   you is basically all the different pair therapy you know magnet kits that you could buy so you
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.440]   really can't find any actual magnet biomagnets you know that are used for magnetic therapy and
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.760]   which is what I'm going to cover that later in the video on how you can find those but not on
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.840]   Amazon okay so that's the three basic forms and the third one here is this video let's talk about
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.920]   using just magnets one one magnet at a time kind of thing okay so what's in this video is let's
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.320]   talk about I'm going to share with you the pioneers of biomagnetic so I promise I'll keep it short
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.360]   the research findings which is the key thing here is like what's the research say
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.920]   most importantly for me I don't know about you I mean I like science I like to learn about it but
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.400]   I want to know you know is it actionable if it's actionable like how do I do it because I always
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.560]   want to tinker with stuff right so if that's you then you know I'm definitely going to be talking
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.640]   about the practical application of you know how do you do this and what do you do
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.280]   and for how long and etc and then also to like I said where to find biomagnets and also to what
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.440]   the cautions there are some cautions that you really do need to be aware of if you're going to go
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.080]   down this branch of you know health and healing modality right and give this the try now the first
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.960]   thing about pioneers I just want to stipulate this is not a new thing I mean I found the oldest book
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:58.560]   I could go back in time and find was a book written in 1906 by a guy named Daniel Hull and he wrote
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.560]   the very first book called magnetic healing now there's been several other books that have been
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.880]   published since that in the 50s 60s 70s 80s and 90s you know they're called magnet therapy by
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.320]   Philpott Berla-Hanneman and then most recently I believe there's like a 1996 book called magnetic
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.200]   healing by a guy named Payne so you know it's out there it's been out there for a while and
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.840]   these are just some of the books and I do want to stipulate it in the research I discovered
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.680]   one of the things was is if a book was titled Biomagnetics it's really the sciency you know physics
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.280]   kind of information whereas if you look if you're looking for just magnetic therapy if you're if
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.480]   you're a practitioner and you're looking to expand your practice and in and offerings you can provide
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.360]   for your clients or you just want to tinker with yourself a family and friends then you want to go
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.120]   and do the research under the keyword magnet therapy and not biomagnetics I call it biomagnetics because
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.880]   it just is right but that's kind of this weird distinction in the in the books and I have dozens
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.760]   of books on this kind of subject now those are the pioneers it started in 1906 as far as I can tell
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.240]   all the way up until now in terms of people who wanted to know what was the effect of magnets on
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.040]   living organisms and that's what they studied you know but I really want to point out that to
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.320]   me this is my personal opinion that you know when we stand on the shoulders of giants in trying to
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.800]   you know move forward with our knowledge and our ability to help others health you know with their
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.480]   health and their healing and and then my own to me the actual founders of where it's become when
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.400]   what it's become in terms of biomagnetics and magnet therapy are two gentlemen and they truly
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.800]   are to me you know the the giants and this is Albert Roy Davis and Dr. Walter C. Rawls these two
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.640]   gentlemen work together they formed a company called Biomagnetics USA it's now defunct and they've
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.800]   just started started actually like Albert Roy was basically I think he was doing his research for
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.960]   about 15 20 years and then Walter you know Dr. Rawls joined him and did and they researched
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.520]   together for an additional 15 years Davis passed away and Rawls kept doing you know going until his
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:18.000]   death in 2009 so these two gentlemen literally spent 50 years studying the effect of magnets on
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.600]   biological organisms plants people pets animals you know that sort of thing and in those 50 years
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:31.600]   these individuals I have to say they did write seven books they wrote numerous papers that had
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:38.960]   over 40 patents and these two gentlemen were the pinnacle of science you know standards you know in
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:45.840]   terms of just they did everything by the book they repeated multi you know the same study multiple
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.400]   times use control groups you know they use the you know placebos with with humans they did
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.600]   every single thing you know to do right if you go and you you know you go and get a science degree
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.840]   these guys were held at a high standard of scientific integrity and they they were the embodiment of
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.600]   that from everything that I've seen on all of the work that they did and the sad thing was was that
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.960]   they they held themselves to such a high standard in order to avoid scrutiny because of the information
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.560]   that they were putting out and what they were discovering in their experiments was so against
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.520]   the traditional beliefs of what the regular science community thought about in terms of
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.440]   magnets and its effect on biological organisms that they were shunned and that's what the amazing
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.920]   part of the story is is that these two gentlemen were brilliant groundbreaking founders of an
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.400]   entire science of just how to help heal and treat human beings that really should be
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.600]   something you should be able to go to any doctor for today and they were in they were literally
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:54.400]   shunned they were basically blacklisted and they spent their entire time 30 years you know at last
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.200]   the last 30 years or the 40 years that they were you know doing their experiments and research
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.560]   they did everything they could to justify themselves and they went and approached every
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:11.040]   government body every corporate organization every you know just every academic institution
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.240]   that they could reach out and try to basically be heard and be seen and get their information
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.160]   out into the mainstream and they were and they were just completely ignored and and so it was
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:28.880]   quite amazing you know that such and I called greatness you know in terms of just these two
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.560]   incredible scientists who did this incredible work that that they did over their lifespan
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.160]   to be so ignored is just like one of those you know one of those many stories that I run across
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:46.080]   about the same type of situation a great scientist discovers something awesome and then everybody
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.960]   literally just ignores them even though they can prove it and you can duplicate every single
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:56.560]   study that they published you can duplicate it and get the same results and then and you know at
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.680]   the end of the day you know why were they you know why were they treated that way it's a whole
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.560]   another discussion but I just wanted to stipulate you know that the level of integrity the level
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:11.280]   of documentation that they left behind in terms of what they discovered is beyond is beyond a
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:17.520]   reproach it is it is finite factual scientific evidence and it is in my in my opinion the facts
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:23.360]   regardless of what they're you know what the criticisms were against their work so now again
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.960]   a lot of stuff a lot of research these two guys are great and then in seven books you know it
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:35.120]   took me years to collect this I was literally involved and not involved but interested in this
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:43.280]   science many years ago when bio when their company called Biomanetics USA was still in business
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.240]   and I was the had the fortune of being able to literally purchase all of their different
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.280]   research materials and interact with them and and it was just you know they were alive at the time
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:59.360]   and I'm I'm that old but you know the thing is is that I did collect all their books I literally
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.160]   bought all the products that they sold I experimented for years and so yeah I can I can also personally
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:11.760]   testify that the magnetic theory of their approach is it's factual in terms of my my humble opinion
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:17.360]   and my experience now of the seven books my point is they basically did all their research started
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:23.680]   publishing their findings in books they had it published research papers but in books they
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:29.440]   actually started in 1970 and it took 10 years they wrote seven books and three of the books right
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:34.320]   here the magnetic effect the rainbow in your hands and magnetic energies these are the ones
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.720]   that are actionable so it depends on what your interest is are you interested in the science
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.720]   or are you interested in the application of the science and or possibly you know commercializing
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.000]   it so the how two books are the three books right here as I mentioned shown with the arrows and those
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.400]   are the ones I personally am most interested in I do like the science but again I do really want
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.960]   it to be actionable like what do I do with it and now all of these books are out of print and so
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.320]   the only ones that are available now I believe are the magnetic effect and that's the only one I can
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.040]   I see that's out there for sale all these other books are out of print and they're almost impossible
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:12.480]   to find in fact this one right here this green cover book is is you don't find it anywhere it's not
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.760]   it's not available anywhere and I and I luckily was able to buy one back in the day
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:23.600]   and I have a copy of it so and and it's it's literally their pinnacle of of how to use magnets
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:28.800]   to treat and in diagnose and treat but anyway so that's the thing about their books and their work
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:34.640]   and and them so we're talking about Albert Roy Davison and Walter Rawls work going forward
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.280]   okay I just specifically focusing on what they discovered because they did literally the most
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:44.160]   amount of work first things first is now what is their theory and I think that's real important
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:51.120]   to understand and it's so simple the traditional theory of magnetic fields is that it's homogeneous
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.360]   and it's static meaning that the energy is just there and at anything that you know you take a
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.840]   magnet you go approach anything that's metal it's going to start pulling towards it and the energy
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:05.280]   just is it just emits an energy a magnetic energy and that's called the magnetic field and it's
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.080]   homogeneous it's one energy magnetic energy right it's not green blue it's not there's no different
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:15.760]   flavors it is just what it is and it does what it does and so now here's what the diagram shows
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.920]   you know this is your traditional theory of magnetic fields and that the diagrams show that the
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.240]   south and north pole are pulling in you know an energy to it and then the other fields between the
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.800]   poles are wrapping around in this little circle so now if you take a magnet you put it under like
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.840]   iron filings and you want to kind of see the physical representation of this field you'll also
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.000]   see in traditional science that is exactly what it looks like that's where they got the drawing right
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.920]   so that they'll see that the poles here in north let's north and south are drawing in the magnetic
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.720]   filings and that the circle right here this this creates this circle of effect which is the magnetic
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:55.600]   field of the magnet is circular and it's just all one field based on this picture so that's why the
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.280]   traditional science guys are going to argue and criticize Davis and Rawls and all these other
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.240]   gentlemen because this is what they see and this is what they're told in school however that's not
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:14.160]   the facts the facts are in 1936 Albert Roy Davis discovered that magnetism is composed of two
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:22.720]   energies not one and that is simple and fundamental but it was literally a paradigm shift and in what
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:28.320]   people had been educated to know and is that it's that there literally are you know it's just there's
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:34.320]   a north pole and southport we all know that earth has one however there's a difference between
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:41.120]   north pole energy and south pole energy and that is their discovery of of Davis and then of course
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:46.960]   Rawls joined him and the whole idea was it was that it was it wasn't a static field that the field
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:52.720]   was at actually dynamic and it was actually moving and that the whole idea is if they started testing
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:14:00.080]   with with pendulums where they found that the south pole field was moving in one direction
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.200]   and the north pole field was moving in the opposite direction and in between the field so like right
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.920]   in here right in the middle right where this line is they discovered that there is something they
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.400]   they coined the phrase block wall and that there is a point where there is no magnetism because it
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:19.040]   was basically you know when north and south touch each other right in that very you know middle which
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:24.080]   is like infinitesimally small there's no magnetic field there because these things actually
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.280]   wrap in on themselves on each pole and now when you look at the when you look at the actual movement
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.960]   of the fields they they basically coined the phrase the broken eight which is the waveform that the
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.880]   energy follows which is a basically a broken eight a figure eight and then they went and spent years
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:47.040]   of doing research and experiments to demonstrate that this broken eight figure is present in all
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.960]   of nature because of the way that the magnetic fields north and south earth right us everything
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.480]   has a magnetic field and everything has a polarity north and positive I mean you know north and south
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.040]   right positive and negative and so that's the whole you know the bottom line that is their theory
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:09.520]   in general and its bottom line is that there's two energies not one that north pole energy of a
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:15.200]   magnet is different than south pole energy so what did they do they spent 40 years demonstrating that
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:21.680]   that discovery and they basically exposed all sorts of things to south pole energy and then
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.400]   to north pole energy to see what the difference was to prove that there was a difference so the
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.240]   very first thing that they started looking at in terms of their research findings was plants and
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.920]   that was the first book that Albert Roy Davis co-authored was the the effects it was just the
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:41.360]   research findings of their work on plants and so now it's published in a lot of different places
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.560]   but one of their patents patents four oh two oh five ninety by Albert Roy Davis was he invented
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:52.800]   this gizmo thing that would you could then isolate you know the south pole energy versus
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.840]   north pole energy and then you could treat in bulk you could treat seats you know they did a lot
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.160]   of work with agriculture and they did a lot of work with industry and that was one of the
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:10.240]   inventions he'd come up with and so they had spent years years decades testing their idea on with
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:15.520]   in agriculture agriculture working with farmers and so they there's write-ups on on their work
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.960]   with corn soybeans beans sugar beads peas melons cucumbers oats wheat riley barley and 12 other
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.360]   vegetables and grain plants and so they did all of this study for years and years and years using
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:32.000]   south pole versus north pole versus control group control group meaning you know uh no magnetic fields
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.080]   so you know and then and they did these studies and what and just in summary high level uh you know
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.720]   they they discovered that you know control is control is normal just in a the plants behave
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:49.120]   the way they're supposed to but when they treated it to south pole energy all right they discovered
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.320]   that they would get increased growth i mean we're talking about the seeds and or the live plants
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:00.080]   when they're exposed to just south pole energy they would increase in growth they you know let's
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.520]   say corn would have a longer stock the leafy plants would have bigger leaves and more leaves and they
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.000]   also discovered that they would produce more grow faster so you know and that's a really
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.800]   big deal for agriculture folks right is can you if you could get your plants to grow faster grow
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:20.400]   bigger produce more fruit or whatever it produces right uh that you eat uh that's pretty profitable
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.600]   and so and then so that's what they discovered that north pole did the opposite it made little
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.560]   weakling you know uh you know uh you know uh you know uh you know uh you know plants but then the
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.920]   whole idea of south pole made up some really beefy healthy strong big plants and also one of the
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.200]   interesting thing was they tested these plants for all sorts of different things and one of the
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.080]   most interesting thing was it actually increased the protein content south pole energy would cause
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.640]   the plant to develop more protein grow faster produce more and all sorts of things so that's
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:53.360]   one of the things that they had worked and they discovered as it relates to plants and agriculture
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:59.680]   so now of the 40 years of research you know there's not one specific document uh that you know kind
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:05.120]   of discusses all of the things they found out about mammals but there's this chart that you know
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.800]   Rawls would would share with his audience whenever he gave a lecture so I just got a copy of it and
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.120]   so this is this little chart that Rawls would you know basically it's the summation of 40 years of
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:21.280]   research in terms of the effect of north pole versus south pole energy on mammals and they tested
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:27.840]   in with when they worked with agriculture they tested everything from uh you know chickens and
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:33.760]   ducks and geese and pigs and sheep and cattle and horses and you name it if it if it moved around
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:38.560]   on a farm they they tested these things and they did again for years and multiple times they
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.840]   repeated their studies over and over and so this little chart surmises 40 years of research
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:49.360]   and so one of the things that they found that was most interesting was that when an animal was
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:55.280]   exposed to north energy right north is negative south is positive I know that's weird but that's
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:03.120]   what it is and so when they when they exposed animals to north pole energy that they found that it
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:08.800]   inhibits the you know it inhibits the uh uh the animal just like it did with plants it would
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:14.640]   inhibit the growth versus south pole would excite the growth okay when there's a huge pro and con
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.920]   you would think oh that's a good thing for plants but it turned out not to be a good thing for animals
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:24.560]   and I'll talk you talk with you about that in a second but it also too though there's the positive
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:30.720]   aspects of it when they had the north pole energy would relieve pain and south pole does the opposite
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.560]   of each one of these so I won't read that I'll just tell you what the good stuff was north pole
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:41.440]   relieves pain reduces inflammation produces an alkaline effect reduces symptoms fights infection
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:49.440]   supports healing reduces fluid intention retention increases cellular oxygen encourages deep restorative
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:56.240]   sleep produces a bright mental effect reduces fatty deposits established at the healing polarity
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:03.040]   stimulates melatonin function and it normalizes natural alkaline pH that's what north pole energy
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:09.520]   does uh for the for the body you know for any animal or human okay and that that's their research
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.600]   showed that and they did it over and over again like you can prove it you can do it yourself
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:19.440]   it will do these things and of course south pole energy will do the opposite which is not a good
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:25.040]   thing okay only except for growth there are no there are no positives when it comes to I know
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:31.120]   that's an oxymoron I mean south is positive energy but there's no positive benefit to the south pole
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.680]   energy when exposed to mammals and I really want to point that out and so this is one of the most
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:41.120]   amazing parts of their research was all of these findings and that's how you can use magnets to
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.280]   health you know for health and healing and one of the things I do want to pop in here real quick is
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:51.920]   that William Philpot Dr. Philpot also did a ton of research on magnet therapy and he also wrote books
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:58.240]   and gave lectures and so his findings were almost identical to that of Rawls and Davis okay and so
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.520]   now in his book magnet therapy you'll find on page 32 he has his own chart that semizes the years
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:09.680]   and years of his research and it basically matches everything that Davis and Rawls had discovered
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:15.120]   and he also tested for four extra things that they hadn't tested for and so I just want to add those
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.520]   because I think it's very poignant to just show you that it's not just one group of scientists that
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:25.200]   had discovered this and validated it other scientists had done that as well and came to the same conclusions
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:31.040]   and that not only did north pole energy do all that stuff I just said but it also evolves
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:38.080]   anabolic hormone production okay of course the melatonin is one of them so evokes it evokes
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:44.960]   anabolic hormone production north pole energy clears metabolically produced toxins out of the body
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:50.720]   okay eliminates free radicals and slows down electrical activity of the brain okay so they
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:56.640]   tested for that and I think this is really a big deal because you might know I'm a biohacker and
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:03.520]   I'm really in the longevity and anti-aging. Philpot discovered on top of what Davis and Rawls discovered
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:10.720]   was that it detoxes you right and it improves your whole this is huge and it eliminates free
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:17.360]   radicals these are the two things that are probably the most outstanding you know drivers of of aging
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:24.320]   which is free radicals and and and toxins and so this is his you know Philpot's findings are amazing
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.840]   in fact that you could use north pole energy to to help your body detox and eliminate free
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:34.800]   radicals and he proved it in his in his research so that I think kind of surmises
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:40.480]   the incredible benefits of north pole energy and you know and and the value of the research
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.600]   that these incredible gentlemen brought to the world so now I got to say hey what are some of the
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.680]   you know what are some of the cautions out there now so and like I was telling you about mammals
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:57.520]   and south pole energy so I do want to share this story because it is one of the most amazing
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:03.360]   stories of all of the stuff that I'd read about what the work of these gentlemen and it came from
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:09.680]   a book from Davis and Rawls called magnetism and its effect on the living system page 35 to 37
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.080]   you'll find this story where they talk about their experiments with chickens that they had
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.720]   repeated multiple times okay so they treated chickens basically the chicken would lay an egg
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:24.240]   and then they would put that egg either in a south pole field or a north north pole field
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.480]   and then they would you know the eggs would hatch they would just observe these little chicks
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.240]   they would grow into chickens and literally I think a chicken lives like five something years
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.800]   you know seven years whatever and they would literally study these chickens for their entire
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:42.160]   lifetime and they did it over and over and over so this is pretty profound because this was what
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:48.080]   they'd observed when you took a chicken and you raised it you know while it basically incubated
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:55.120]   you know in a south pole field versus north pole what the difference was so let's start off this
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:01.360]   is right from that book the south pole treated chickens hens and roosters they grew faster and
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.960]   stronger than the north pole chicks they ate more and near maturity took on a trend towards being
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:14.640]   cannibalistic in nature intelligence was lower in all and respects than the other two groups of
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:20.160]   chickens and roosters the other two being a control group that had no magnetic field exposure
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:25.280]   and of course the ones that had north okay so now they grew faster they ate more they turned
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:31.520]   into cannibals and their intelligence was lower south pole north pole chickens roosters they were
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.240]   light eaters developed slower than the control chicks and they were sensitive to all surrounding
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:42.000]   noise noises heat cold wind sun so they were very sensitive to their environment and this was
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.280]   opposed to the boldness dull thinking and reactions and overly strong south pole chickens so they
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.800]   were very much the opposite in terms of their behaviors and now the study also goes on to say
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:58.560]   that the south pole treated chickens and hens were indifferent to any of their surroundings right
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.640]   they were not sensitive at all and completely different than the behavior of the north so they
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:08.240]   were completely different behaviors now which you wouldn't expect right that if they're just
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:13.040]   exposed to quote static magnet fields they should be the same right it would be different in the
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.880]   control group that's what you would expect what you wouldn't expect it to be different if you
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.680]   went south and north pole and that's that's the seminal of their work here was that it's so
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.600]   different so now these these south pole treated chicks and hens were during the last last stages
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:33.600]   of maturity they had started to attack and ate the flesh of the hens right the roosters did and
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.720]   their own kind and were leaders in the cannibalistic attitudes in fact the study actually goes off
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:44.720]   to us on a sidebar and says that you know they got so aggressive these south pole treated chickens
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:50.480]   they got so aggressive that they had to they had to basically separate them from all of the
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.520]   other chickens because they all kind of live together and they were just marked differently
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:57.920]   I think they used some kind of paint on them or something to identify which ones was which but
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.800]   they literally had to corral them all put them in their own pen to keep them away from the rest
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.920]   of the chickens that's how aggressive south pole treated chickens became and in fact they also
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:14.000]   even mentioned in the study that some of these roosters would would escape the pen the south pole
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.600]   treated roosters would escape the pen and they would go out onto the farm and attack other animals
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:25.280]   and so these things became quite aggressive and then also too their sizes of the south pole
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:30.400]   chickens were much larger than the control chicken so they were way bigger than the ones that had
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.960]   no magnetic field at all now opposed to that or the opposite of that the north pole treated
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:41.280]   chickens again were were noted to be very thin nervous sensitive very clean and they ate sparingly
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:46.160]   this group was completely different than the control group okay and they were active and
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.960]   scratched for their own food dressed like less water than either of the treated types so they're
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:56.800]   really different you know in terms of just again their behavior was so damn it's just an amazing
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:02.720]   discovery you know experiment now the conclusion that Rawls and Davis wrote about this these
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:07.120]   experiments with chickens was during the last stages of development the north pole treated birds
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:13.920]   lowered their water intake and increased their food intake okay so they did increase I'm sorry
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.960]   they they lowered it and then this made no difference though to the weight showing here the control
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:24.560]   effect of development of the birds so treated at conception and prior to conception the effects
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.720]   then followed through the stages of development from the embryo these experiments were reproduced
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.720]   many times it was very clear that certain genetic changes affecting the growth
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.960]   development attitudes physical development mental attitudes and psychological attitudes
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.720]   had been altered or changed by the magnetic separate pole radiation of the eggs and that is
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:48.400]   profound you know if you've ever studied any of the work by Dr. Jack Cruz and his work on epigenetics
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.600]   then you know what's amazing here is that while they didn't put it in these terms
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:28:01.440]   Davidson Rawls discovered that the effect of either pole of magnetic energy on mammals
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:08.480]   during conception and prior to conception and incubation gestation so forth had an epic genetic
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:14.400]   effect on the mammal and I think that is just profound and I can't it just blows my mind that
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:21.120]   traditional academic science just ignores this stuff it just blows my mind okay anyway that's
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:27.200]   my my editorial sorry about that okay so now let's talk about practical application if this
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:32.240]   hasn't wowed you and went whoa you know I didn't know magnets could do this and then let me talk
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:37.040]   to you about how do you take this into your own life help your clients help your family help
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.760]   your friends help yourself and so now there's two books that the Davidson Rawls wrote
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.280]   and that's the magnetic effect right here and of course the hand ones which not this not that video
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:52.480]   and then the magnetic energies now two of these books have all of the directions that they came up
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:57.280]   with in their experiments when they would experiment on people or you know they would find certain
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:02.000]   specific ways to do it what type of magnet where to put it how long to put it okay so all of that
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.640]   was figured out by them and that's what you know that's what all their their work is all about at
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:12.160]   the end of their you know at the end of their you know I guess their their life's time of work
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:16.640]   at the end they were basically putting together information to help other people and actually
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:22.080]   start using magnets for therapy and so they in this one book now the green one again is is not
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:27.360]   available anywhere you won't find it and so I'm not going to cover that one just because you
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.680]   won't be able to get it but you can get the magnetic effect book and so here's just the list of the
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:38.880]   things in that specific book and it also shares with you how to go and use magnets for your own
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:43.680]   health healing and again your you know clients whatever and so you know it covers everything from
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:50.800]   blood clots to burns to bronchitis to you know sore muscles helping your heart you know glaucoma
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.520]   you know I'm just going on teeth you know ulcers and all that sort of thing so how do you use
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:00.240]   magnets to help certain things and I know that you know we're all human beings so I thought you
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:06.960]   would be interested in this one right here it's called let's see I think it's called sex life and
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:12.800]   aging page 73 so I won't read the whole page to you so let me just read to you the section because
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.600]   I thought you would all be very interested because we're you know you're human about how do you use
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:23.200]   magnets for your sex life huh all right so I'm just going to read a three paragraph reporter
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.200]   unlike men and women animals have two natural cycles of sex well defined to the physical and
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.520]   mental desires of the animals these cycles occur in the spring and the fall right the
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:36.400]   writing season etc now and you know humans kind of have that same seasonal thing we just don't talk
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:42.960]   about it and the research on magnetism applied to all forms of life systems placing the animal's
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:51.040]   seat on the north pole reduces the desire for sex opposite to this placing the south pole to the
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:58.240]   seat acts to promote the desire for sex these results occur in disregard of the natural sex cycle
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:04.160]   time for this reacher's is 20 minutes morning and evening a sensible manner of restraining
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:10.800]   an animal for this application may be necessary to prevent injury while in restraint the n1 bile
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:16.960]   magnet may be used magnet of magnets of less strength from 800 to 1500 goss have been found
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:22.080]   satisfactory for this research be sure your research magnets are correctly identified
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:27.520]   north and south pole we emphasize that the north pole of a magnet seeks a south pole attraction
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:34.720]   the south pole a north pole attraction identify the poles correctly so so for those of you who
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:43.680]   may be interested in uh motivating your spouse go get a magnet south pole now don't forget okay so
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.920]   that's the practical application and where to find it so right here you can definitely find it in
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.640]   this book and if you ever can find this one book called magnetic energies uh then you're definitely
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.480]   gonna you know that'll be the other book as well uh the difference between the two books is they
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.880]   have all this kind of information in it but this green one here the magnetic energies goes into
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:06.400]   also not just treatment but also in terms of diagnostics okay i'll show you the magnet that
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:13.120]   it gets used with now practical application how to determine north from south well you know if
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:18.400]   you buy a magnet most magnets don't have a north and a south written down on it or painted on it
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.720]   uh you know you just get a bar magnet so there's three different ways you can identify the
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:28.080]   difference between north and south if you have a compass uh which you know some people do i mean
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:35.600]   you basically just note that the south pole of the needle will point to the north pole of the magnet
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:42.880]   right because in nature opposites attract all right so it's the south pole of the needle
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:49.920]   points to north pole magnet okay that's how that works so remember that if you have a compass now
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.160]   if you're like me and you're you know i'm a total nerd i've got tons of different meters i have a
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:59.440]   magnometer uh and this is what a little magnometer it's very sensitive it's for low low strength fields
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:06.160]   and by the way the strength of a magnet is measured in a in a term called gauss and so this thing is
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:12.400]   really it's only measures up to ten gauss plus or minus now remember that south is positive and
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:18.160]   north is negative on it on a gauss meter and so you can use a gauss meter and i'm going to show
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:23.600]   you a video of me using my gauss meter uh it's called a magnometer and so you can use that and
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:28.880]   there's also more you know more you know more expensive you know electronic devices that i'll
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:33.600]   measure gauss uh as well and you can find those anywhere now the third way which is probably the
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.160]   easiest for all of you guys out there who don't have you know compasses and magnometers uh is to
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:43.760]   just use a pendulum and any kind of pendulum will work this is just an example even a little nut
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:50.160]   on a string uh and just to remember that if you hang a pendulum over a magnet the magnetic field
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:55.920]   interacts with your own magnetic magnetic fields right and it'll cause the pendulum to swing or
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:01.760]   you know or you know basically spin and so now if it's a if it's the south pole side of the magnet
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:08.320]   that you're holding the pendulum over uh it'll start to swing clockwise now if it's north it'll
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:13.040]   swing counterclockwise and that's how you can tell so once you identify it you can do like me use a
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.560]   sharpie right and just make a little note n or s so you can remember in the future which side
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:23.920]   of the magnet is north or south okay so that's as easy it is it's pretty easy to determine uh you
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:28.000]   know what what side is what because a lot of the magnets you're going to buy will not be marked and
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   you're going to need to know uh in order to replicate any of this research and or try this stuff on
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.480]   yourself now where do you find the magnets well the thing about uh the the davis and rolls they
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.520]   actually were selling these magnets i bought some i have them i'm very blessed and very lucky that
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.920]   they were around when you know i was around when they were around and i could buy directly
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.920]   from them and buy these magnets that they had custom made for their research that they were
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:56.320]   selling to the general public so that when so then if you read their work and you see they're saying
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:02.000]   hey and then n one magnet or for this therapy or an n two magnet for that therapy just note that
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.160]   the n one was thirty five hundred gals very strong magnet these are ceramic magnets now do not use
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:14.000]   neomidium these the rare earth magnets are way too strong and they don't fit the bill they're not
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.040]   the uh the strength they need to be a lot less as you know less strong so neomidium uh and all of
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:26.720]   those rare earth magnets don't use those this in this world you live in the ceramic magnet space
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:31.760]   okay and so you want to and so if you have or could get a hold of an n one you'd want to get a magnet
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:36.960]   that's thirty five hundred gals and when they say use an n two it's forty five hundred gals all right
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.600]   now the thing about it of course again now the website's gone you can't buy these magnets any
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:47.120]   more uh so i went hunting and hunting and hunting for this video to say hey where could you uh find
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:51.840]   a magnet that's even remotely close because these were custom made by davis and roles and only sold
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.560]   through their website back in the day so i did find a company called applied magnet superstore
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:01.840]   and they sell ceramic block magnets okay and so i did find one that was actually the same size of
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.720]   the n two uh and but it's but all of their magnets that applied magnets is thirty eight hundred and
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:11.680]   fifty gals so it's right in the middle between n one and n two and i'm thinking that if you guys
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:16.560]   really wanted to get into uh magnet therapy that this would probably be an adequate magnet because
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:22.160]   in a lot of their work as you noted earlier uh when i had spoken about the you know the difference
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.040]   in in treating uh you know um something i forgot what i was already uh you know that you could use
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.360]   a lower part magnet so the whole idea here is that you know you can definitely use this magnet from
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:35.760]   everything i've read this would be a really great magnet to use except you're going to just get it
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.120]   and it's not going to be marked you're going to need to figure out which is north and south so
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:45.520]   just to kind of show you that if you go to applied magnets that's that's this store you click right
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:50.560]   here on ceramic magnets and you want to go to ceramic you know ceramic magnets bars
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.600]   and then here you go and this is where you can uh find all of the different magnets and of course
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:00.400]   this one right here is the one i bought and it's uh six inches by four inches by half an inch and
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:04.720]   it's only eight dollars and nine cents the shipping is kind of uh the pricey it's
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:09.920]   shipping is like 16 bucks because the thing's really heavy uh but the whole idea here is it's
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:14.880]   only eight ninety nine and you know for uh for if you want to get into magnet therapy this would
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.600]   probably be a really great magnet to get and you know something weird that i well not weird but i
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:24.480]   guess it's uh typical right that i found when i was researching magnets was i found this one
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:29.920]   magnet you know pro health magnet superstore selling all sorts of magnet dohikis and good gizmos
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:33.760]   and here you go look at this one they're selling a magnetic ceramic block sorry
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:41.840]   but they're selling it on sale for 36 bucks seriously 36 dollars it's eight ninety nine at
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:47.440]   applied magnets okay so you know i'm just saying i just don't you know anyway nothing against these
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.520]   guys you know god bless them and all that but hey man uh that's a little bit of profiteering when
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:56.640]   you know that you know you can buy one for nine bucks uh versus 36 so just a little bit of heads
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.840]   up there anyway that's how you find some magnets let me show you this little video
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:06.080]   about so this is mine these are my magnets right here so that's the n one and that's the n two
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.000]   n one is uh basically two inches wide and the other one's four inches wide but they're all six
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.640]   inches long now my magnometer here you can show i'm showing it right here that i'm pointing it to
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:20.640]   the north pole of that magnet the n one magnet and you can see where i get to 10 gals very quickly
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.800]   not you know not even getting within 12 inches of the magnet that just shows you how incredibly
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:30.240]   strong it is 12 inches away it's already reading on the magnet on the magnometer okay so now
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.000]   show right here if you see the negative that means that is the north pole side
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.440]   and it's too strong so you don't i don't want to blow my magnometer these things will blow up on
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.920]   with really strong magnet magnets so i just keep it as far away as i need to and then i flip the
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:49.040]   magnet over and right here you can see these red x's that's what Davis and Rawls put on their
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:54.160]   magnet so people would know which side was south and you'll see that when i when i flip the magnet
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:59.760]   over so that south is pointing up the magnometer immediately flips over to the positive side
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.960]   showing that hey this side is positive energy and it is south pole okay so that's really how to use
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:11.200]   the magnometer of course that is again that's the n one on the left and the n two on the side these
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:15.920]   are from Davis and Rawls from their website back in the day now for this magazine or sorry this
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:21.120]   book right here is that green one i was talking about called magnetic energies now what that book
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:28.240]   came with from Rawls was another magnet a bile magnet that had basically a red right there on
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:33.040]   the bottom showing where the south pole was obviously the other side was north and then that
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:38.080]   they called that little magnet they called it the actuator and you can and it's used basically that
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:45.360]   book shows you how or tells you how to use the actuator to use a magnet to diagnose the body you
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:50.320]   know different organs different areas of the body in terms of trying to determine whether or not
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.600]   the magnetic field of that organ or whatever you know was was in good health or not and then of
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.680]   course you'd flip it over and treat it so really quite very interesting book now this is the other
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.040]   thing that they were selling which i thought was interesting and there's actually a separate patent
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:08.880]   by another person out there in the patent database about using magnets to treat problems with the
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:13.680]   eyes okay so now if they ran into someone who had you know things like glaucoma or floaters or
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:17.920]   anything like that they made these glasses that they sold on their website where they basically
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:26.640]   took a thin you know you know polarity bile polarity magnet and they basically would have the
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:31.760]   north pole facing in south pole facing out and they just glued that to the these little safety
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.720]   glasses and then you would wear these glasses for 10-20 minutes at a time to treat your condition if
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.960]   you had an eye condition so this is some little thing that they sold on the website and i'm just
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:45.200]   you know me i'm just a tinker so i bought them all now this magnet right here is the applied magnet
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:50.400]   that i showed you on the website again there's no indication of what side is what so
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:54.080]   when you get that magnet there's no x or anything on it you're going to have to go ahead and find
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.000]   which side is the one you want so there you go those are the magnets that i have from
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.360]   Rawls and Davis now lastly i do want to talk about other cautions that i think are very very
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.840]   important for you to be aware of if you're going to get into magnet therapy and the very
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:14.080]   first one which i think is the most important one is this if you have electronics in your body
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:19.280]   don't do this just don't do it absolutely don't do this because if you look up the
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:24.880]   what is the specification on pacemakers in terms of magnetic field strength exposure
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:31.040]   it'll tell you flat out it's one gauss one gauss okay in other words don't go near magnetic fields
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:35.760]   strong magnetic fields if you have a pacemaker and who know i didn't look up all the other things that
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:41.120]   you know doctors are shoving in people's bodies so bottom line is you know just like i say too
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:47.200]   as well as not just biomagnetic therapy but also bioelectric therapy it's just not meant for you
[00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:52.560]   if somebody's decided to put electronics in your body do not do not play in this world this is not
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:58.400]   your world uh sorry but it's just it's too much of a you know it could hurt you because it could
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.800]   mess up the electronics in you so don't do it so okay so that's just that maybe i should have said
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.600]   this in the beginning i don't know hopefully you watched it to this point uh okay uh and now the
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:13.200]   other thing too is the exposure to south pole energy so i want to say something that is so
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.200]   pointingly i mean yeah you know of course it's gonna you know south pole energy grows
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:23.440]   plants better uh you know grows bigger chickens if you're a chicken farmer uh it will you know
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.040]   it'll improve your sex life you know but the whole idea too though is you're going to grow
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:32.640]   cannibalistic chickens and uh you know and and the rest of it and all of the detriments to south
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:37.520]   pole energy and so it is a huge problem because one of the things that they wrote a lot of patents
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:42.240]   for and they wrote a lot about the you know davis and roles was the dangers of south pole energy
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:46.640]   you know in addition to the positive benefits of north pole energy but there is a huge danger
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:52.320]   to south pole energy and i want to show you a demonstration and my personal story about this
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:57.680]   so now here are three separate things that you put in your ear on your ears okay so i've got
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:04.000]   this is mine here's just a regular sorry a regular pc headphone right i used to wear
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:11.280]   um when i when i was working from home and then i've got my apples these are old the old wired ones
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:17.520]   but the apple earbuds uh that i got with my iphone way back in the day and then right here is a
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:24.640]   wireless jambra which is the plant tronics uh you know headsets that i used to have in my office
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:31.360]   when i was working as a white collar uh debt slave okay in an office and so i used to wear this thing
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:36.080]   constantly because i i was constantly in meetings and it was my wireless expensive three hundred
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:41.440]   and four hundred dollar uh you know device that i did i got myself so the idea here is that you
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:46.720]   know when you're putting stuff on your head or you're sitting inside of a let's say electronic
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:51.920]   vehicle or anything you're exposed to that's you know going to be something along the lines of
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:57.760]   magnetic you need to be aware and this is my caution about are you sitting in a south pole
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:05.120]   field or are you exposing your brain to south pole energy which is bad or is it north pole energy
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:09.920]   which is good so so now here's the difference here so let me go ahead and i'll show you what
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:16.320]   happens i'm testing the regular old pc the uh headset that i got off amazon and i had to buy
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:21.760]   four or five of these before i found this one this particular model which was north pole energy
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:27.920]   right negative is north and so this was a headset that i would wear and i would feel comfortable with
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:33.280]   it and it had no effect no negative effect on me uh and so this was like i consider it you know
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:38.960]   north pole energy is safe it's beneficial to the human body and so yeah put this thing up on my ear
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.800]   next to my brain um you know it was was not a detriment and uh you know it was just i actually
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:49.440]   like i said i bought four of these things through the other three away kept this one because it was
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:55.360]   the only one that they sold me that was north pole magnet towards my head now if you look at the old
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:01.120]   i own i earbuds i haven't tested a new one i don't have an iphone now but take a look at this one
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:07.840]   even though this is a very very weak magnetic field coming off of this earbud it is south pole
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:12.240]   energy so you know if you wear it for just a little while i mean it's so weak that if you just
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.480]   wore it right you know for like one phone call i don't think it would really affect you but if
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.840]   you wore this thing all the time like you see people out in public where they just like
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.600]   why the hell are you wearing this thing just shopping at target you know target but you know
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   people do they listen to music or whatever but if you can imagine prolonged exposure
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:33.440]   to even a weak south pole field what's that going to do to your brain let alone your behavior all
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.840]   right so not good you know it just demonstrates to you not good but you want to see what's worse
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:43.680]   when i used to be that you know white-collar debt slave working in an office i had wore this i
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:47.280]   wore it literally all day long you know i'd go to the bathroom wearing the stupid thing the only
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:53.200]   time i'd put it you know take it off as the battery died so here's what a very expensive
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:46:00.880]   Jabra uh Jabra plantronics wireless headphone uh dust to your brain check that out
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:09.120]   that is south pole energy again it's weak it's not as uh as as weak as the earbuds but it is south
[00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:14.400]   pole energy and what do you do with it you wear it you know i used to be like six hours a day
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:21.440]   in meetings it'd be wear it for hours and hours and hours and so that's how in my opinion based
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:26.960]   on the research of davis and roles and phil pot and everyone else is that the south pole energy
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:32.960]   is not good for you and i highly caution you guys to understand that what you put against your brain
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:38.560]   makes a huge difference to your life and my personal testimony was was when i was a debt slave
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:43.680]   and working in an office wearing this stupid headset with the south pole energy for six hours
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:50.080]   a day or more i used to go home every day and i'd just be in a foul mood i mean just foul and i used
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:55.200]   to think that the foul mood was just work stressed not enough sleep and traffic you know traffic
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:59.360]   and so then what was weird about it was uh you know and you know and you know you live with your
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:04.400]   family and unfortunately we do take out our frustrations on those around us um and so yeah
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.680]   i was just in a every day every day five days a week bad mood when i get home
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:13.440]   and i just again i thought it was because of stress and blah blah blah anyway so the pandemic hit and
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:18.240]   you know march of 2020 everybody got kicked out of our offices and told to go work from home
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.080]   well this headset didn't work on my home phone or i didn't bring it with me i left it in my office
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:25.920]   i went home and i had this at home or you know i because i'd done all this research and then
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:32.480]   and so i you know i got this one um and this was before i even thought to test this one seriously
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:37.520]   i'm just you know hey uh my bad i you know i know all of this stuff but then i always i forgot to test
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:42.400]   this one until like around the pandemic when i got this one and i started thinking about it
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.760]   because i had to buy this one i started to think about it and went wait a minute what's you know
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.840]   so that's when i tested this and i didn't test this again from that or any long story sorry
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.680]   anyway so i tested this one found one that was not north you know that was north pole not south pole
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:58.320]   and started wearing that every day well yeah i didn't have the whole issue of traffic to you know
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:03.040]   you know kind of annoy me all you know on my way home from work or to work but i still had all the
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:07.440]   stress i still had all the lack of sleep i still had all the work you know hours and hours and hours
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:12.880]   and meetings and then guess what i was no longer ever ever in a bad mood in the afternoon and you
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:17.360]   know my even my daughter noticed you know like wow you're really changing i'm like yeah you know i
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:21.680]   wasn't getting any better sleep my work wasn't any less stressful it was even more stressful
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:26.480]   because we had so much work to do and you had to do it without you know you know without being
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:30.960]   able to meet with each other physically and all that stuff so yeah i mean literally i was working
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:37.680]   from home for three years before i retired and the difference between how i felt uh where in this
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:43.360]   one versus how i felt wearing this one was night and day which is north and south so that's my
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:50.080]   testimony there so again i really caution everybody to watch your exposure to south pole energy and
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:54.080]   please take care of yourself now the other thing too the last caution i want to point out is the
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:58.400]   prolonged exposure to north pole energy so you know there's a lot of you guys out there that are
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:04.960]   into like you know magnet you know magnet uh pads that you put on your bed you know there's everything
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:10.480]   from bracelets to things you put around your body uh you know there's i haven't seen magnet socks you
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.640]   know i mean so there's all these different products out there and whether or not the developers of
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:19.520]   those products decided to research uh Rawls and Davis and tip you know Phil Pot and all those other
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:23.520]   guys i mean did they really do their homework when you're laying on a mat are you really laying on
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:28.480]   north pole energy yourself so if you're gonna do that uh you want to two things you know you're
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:37.120]   gonna buy a magnet product magnetic product just dows it you know is it north towards you or south
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:43.680]   towards you and you know and then of course bad versus good and secondly the prolonged exposure
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:50.720]   now one of the things about prolonged exposure was uh if you listen to any of the dr Rawls lectures
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:55.840]   he talked about two things and i think is why they are their bullets on this slide
[00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:01.120]   first thing was is he m you know just absolutely emphatically would stipulate every time he gave
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:08.000]   a speech that he would never use anything or ever expose himself to south pole energy given
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.760]   40 years of his research into what it would do he would just avoid it like the plague so based on
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:19.920]   his recommendation alone uh given who he is uh and also his demonstrated experiments and the results
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:25.520]   of those uh exposure to south pole energy is not a good thing be very careful and that's directly
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:29.920]   from Walter Rawls the other thing that Walter Rawls would stipulate too is that while north pole
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:35.680]   energy was positive it's not it's not meant for prolonged he would never ever go beyond the confines
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:40.080]   of his research which was like 20 minutes day and night kind of thing so prolonged like all night
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:46.560]   long he did not agree that that was a beneficial thing for the human body because the body has its
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:52.080]   own magnetic field its own polarity and if you expose it to one side or the other for too long
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:57.680]   you're going to throw off your own body okay and and that's why he would basically emphatically
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:03.040]   also state that even though north pole energy was positive for the body prolonged exposure to it
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:08.720]   was not good and i know you know and i never got a chance to talk to him but based on everything
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:13.600]   he wrote all of his articles his books and things like that it is very clear that he did not approve
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:19.200]   of magnetic sleeping pads because you just would like you and you don't do that do not sleep on a
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:25.520]   magnetic pen that is from Walter Rawls now so that's just to keep that in mind that's what this
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:32.640]   research shows but there's also other doctors and scientists out there you know doc PhD guys
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:39.360]   who've done studies on pads so i'm not i'm on the fence right now because i just started doing
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:45.120]   research on another scientist who who did a lot of research on magnetic sleeping pads
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:51.040]   and he discovered a way to counteract the the negative effect on your bio field for prolonged
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:56.000]   exposure so that's another video okay but i just want to say that you know i'm on the fence about
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:01.840]   sleeping pads but Walter Rawls was basically adamantly against them there that's it okay
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:07.040]   hey thanks for watching if you made it this far thank you so much you know if you like this kind
