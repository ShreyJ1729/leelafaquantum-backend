[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me, Kay Elmer, and in
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.240]   this video I'm covering part two of the what we have learned series about C60 in
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.400]   the last few years since C60 took off as a health supplement. And so let's jump
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.940]   right in. This obviously have got some disclaimers. This material is for
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.480]   research purposes only. C60 is not approved for consumption by the FDA. You
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.880]   understand that consuming C60 is experimental and you do so at your own
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.200]   risk. I do not have a stake in any C60 product or company and I do not get paid
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.860]   for making C60 videos. I'll be covering quite a few different products in this
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.600]   video. I just want to make sure that everyone realizes I don't get paid
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.680]   for for mentioning videos and me mentioning videos is certainly not an
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.320]   endorsement. And I also want to claim fair use on a few copyright materials
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.260]   I'd like to share with you today because you know some things are just so much
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.360]   better explained from the source. So I'll have a lot of copyright material or
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.880]   not a lot but I'll have some that I just want to just claim fair use. Just a
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.520]   little clips other folks videos just so that you can kind of hear it from the
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.520]   horse's mouth. I mean exactly how stuff works etc. A note on source materials. I
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.240]   do want to just again as just like I had in part one there's so many documents
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.600]   involved in this video that I had to review in the part of the research for
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.800]   making it that there's no way to link them all in the video description. So if
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.600]   it's a document which is includes studies, patents, clinical trials, they're all
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.160]   here in a directory on my Google Drive. Okay so when if you're interested in
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.680]   doing your own research I've provided copies of all of the documents that I'm
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.720]   mentioning. Any video that I mentioned or any website other the links for those
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.880]   will be in the video description so you're getting 100% of all of the sources
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.640]   that I'll be covering today in this video. So you can do your own research
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.040]   100% transparency. I don't want to make a claim without letting you know what
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.360]   the source is all right. So that's kind of where we're gonna go and let's jump
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.240]   right in. First thing first is I want to do an addendum to part one because after
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.840]   that video you know I was able to locate the longevity study where Chris Burris
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.760]   from SES was talking about him doing a new study. So this is gonna be this is
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.720]   gonna be awesome. It's gonna take about five years. It's starting in 2020 but
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.680]   SES is gonna repeat the rat study. So this is gonna be one more so if you recall
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.040]   from part one you know it's so critical that we have validation that the original
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.880]   rat study was accurate and so I and Mitchell from Health C360 had done a
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.720]   test using P53 knockout rats and validated the study but did not publish
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.960]   and now SES with Chris Burris is gonna be doing the rat study again one more
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.440]   time and then this is the video. So all of the links again to any of these videos
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.480]   is in the video description below and so there's a video describing how SES is
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.800]   gonna be going and doing that you know rat study. So that's awesome. I mean
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.200]   that's just amazing that you know and kudos to you guys for doing that. Also C60
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.120]   I'm sorry SES reached out to me and and said you know here's the video that I
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.560]   was talking about in part one and so this is their note is Chris Burris and
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.800]   SES research labs purchased 22 online C60 products in March 2020 to test their
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.960]   C60 concentrations as per their labels. The lab called the overall results
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.600]   woefully low because many of the companies only had 10 to 30% of the maximum
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.400]   concentrations promised. So you know bottom line and that's this whole
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.960]   consumer C60 study so now you've got that study I mentioned in part one you've
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.800]   got SES doing a separate study then you've got that old study on longevity but
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.800]   here's what's really important I mean this is as of March the other study was
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.220]   as of October published right and bottom line is the consumer C60 oil
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.260]   products have now been tested you know formally twice you know I really don't
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.100]   count the longevity but you know because it was so long ago but it's been
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.880]   formally and officially tested twice once by SES which is the largest C60
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.480]   producer in the country United States highly reputable as well as a you know
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.340]   a science study and bottom line is what you think you're getting most often is
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.280]   probably not what you're getting in terms of the quantity of C60 in the oil and
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.040]   so here's a very important point from SES which they're also known as C60
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.320]   EVO is you need an HPLC machine to measure the C60 concentration in the
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.720]   oil most of the online companies don't have so you know it's a good point that
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.040]   they're making and I want to just repeat it is if you're going to be
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.780]   spending a lot of money and this stuff is not cheap then one of the most
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.040]   important questions you should ask from the seller is have you tested your
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.020]   concentration to know for a fact and can I see the test results that what's on
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.660]   the label is true and that's it that's all you've got to do and so there's a
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.100]   few reputable companies that are actually using HPLC which is stands for
[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.100]   high-performance liquid chromatography in which they measure that the final
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.460]   product so that they know for a fact hey you know that's what what we said it
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.120]   was it's 0.8 milligrams per milliliter because otherwise you're just buying
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.900]   oil and and and this kind of you know and when you really think about this the
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.900]   difference in in the amount of C60 in different I'm we're talking about 22
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.700]   different products right the other one just measured four so this is a lot more
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.180]   significant but the idea though is that hey you know you're not buying oil you're
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.780]   buying C60 and this might explain why there's so many people out there that say
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.540]   oh I took it nothing happens you know and they have a bad they had a bad
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.260]   experience well or non-experience and it's like well what did you take you know
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.060]   I mean that's now I'm starting to really wonder where all of that feedback came
[00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.940]   from because you've got people that'll take 660 I mean lots of people really
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.060]   positive results and then you have lots of people if you look at all the
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.020]   comments and I've done videos about people's comments on 6 16 testimonials
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.100]   and they're like nothing happened well maybe you took one of those those
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.780]   products that have nothing in it or little you know or a little bit so it
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.540]   really does explain why there's such a variance in testimonies and then the
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.620]   other thing I do want to point out and there's a link in the video description
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.260]   Chris Burris was interviewed by Gwen Foster about it I don't know that within
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.580]   last year there's a link for the video and in that video and this is one of the
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:58.380]   reasons that may be causing this problem in the industry is that Chris said that
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:04.260]   SES has discovered or had discovered that the larger the batch right of oil
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:10.260]   that you're spinning or stirring the higher the risk of having basically
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:16.260]   dead zones in the VAT meaning that where C60 will settle in in little pockets
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.660]   where it's just not catching in the stirring process or the movement of the
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.900]   oil and so the larger your VAT the the longer this is what SES said in the
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.820]   video Chris said in the videos that the bigger your batch the longer you need
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.060]   to stir because of those dead zones and if any of you've ever made your own C60
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.500]   and compared you doing it in a flask which is a conical flask versus a
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.660]   straight wall beaker you'll know as well if you just dump in the C60 in a
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.100]   flask it it'll just sink and then slide off to the side and if you want to get
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.340]   that into solution you're going to need to stir longer and so it you know that's
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.020]   it's it's I've seen it I've done it myself and so that's why you know I go
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.580]   to straight wall beakers and I'll talk about that in a little while but but
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.500]   bottom line though is the bigger the VAT the longer you need to stir and so
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.700]   actually SES announced in that video that they're stirring their C60 olive oil
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.620]   for three weeks now just catch all that those those dead zones and make sure
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.340]   that they get a full saturation so another really important thing because I
[00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.700]   know a lot of folks in the C60 industry watch these this series from the
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:23.740]   comments earlier and so head you know heads up to that if you want to hear
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.540]   what Chris said the link is in the description so consumer C60 oil study
[00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.900]   does not look good for the community and I highly recommend that you all start
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.100]   asking the people you're buying C60 oil from or make it yourself and if you're
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.060]   making it yourself and you want to know that you got all the saturation it's
[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.580]   pretty simple you stir it up and then when you're done settling you look at the
[00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.500]   bottom of the of the beaker and there should be nothing there and then you
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.580]   filter it there should be nothing on the filter it gets where it all went it's
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.820]   all in solution and you're good to go so it's pretty simple at one liter at a
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.740]   time but you know when you're making gallons you know that's where you got
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.900]   issues right and of course here's the proof there's issues there you go enough
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.780]   about that now I want to get into the what we have learned part two very first
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.500]   thing I want to chat about is the C60 hydrogen connection you know one of the
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:16.180]   coolest things about C60 and and in the beginning you know I knew just
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.860]   generally how C60 worked and basically you know it's an antioxidants and
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.460]   electron donor but I never really got deep into the chemistry and so I kind of
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.660]   started looking at the studies and sure enough not only is has a theory of how
[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:37.100]   C60 can capture hydrogen ions and here's an hydrogen molecule in within the
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.500]   cage structure of the fullerene this is your this this different diagram here
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:47.660]   is represents the the orbital of each of the 60 atoms of the carbon 60 but here's
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.340]   like right here this would be a representation of the C60 fullerene
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:56.020]   cage and then with trapped we're here would be a hydrogen ion and then here
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.420]   would be a hydrogen molecule and then you've got the studies over here that
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.180]   they're all in the you know they're all in the directory directory where they've
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.060]   been able to synthesize that in the lab in other words they've been able to
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:10.980]   verify and validate that though that the openings of the cage are large enough to
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.240]   encompass you know something going inside and so they've been able to
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.580]   validate that through scientific studies so they've proven it that hey
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.980]   that's how it does work it will work and it's size that way and then of course
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.500]   you've got this animation that kind of shows you what it would look like in
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:33.980]   under that concept so the very first thought is hey C60 will and can and does
[00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:39.140]   capture hydrogen ions and hydrogen molecules within its cage like
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.940]   structure and and why is that important so right here there's been two recent
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.060]   videos within the last couple of months one by Ken Schwartz which is the chemist
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:53.260]   and owner operator of C60 power and he does this C60 show great reference if
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:58.660]   you want to learn about C60 you should subscribe to the C60 show that Ken does
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:04.420]   and he's a chemist by trade and one of the original you know individuals in the
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:09.380]   C60 industry and he made a video and he basically described the process of how
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.380]   C60 and hydrogen work together and then if you want there's another video that
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.900]   just came out recently by Dr. Joe Neosima hope I pronounced that correctly he's
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.380]   a PhD and he's a professional toxicologist both of these gentlemen have
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.540]   worked 30 years working in their field and specifically over a decade working
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:32.320]   with C60 and they both in two different videos describe exactly how C60 and
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.260]   hydrogen work together and I just wanted to share a Ken's version primarily
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.780]   because it's a lot shorter than Joe's okay so here's how it works he has a
[00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.180]   very unique shape it's a spherical shape can you tell us about what the
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:49.060]   differences between a single molecule and then the nanopolic yeah a single
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:53.980]   molecule of C60 in between the the five hexes here all the chemical activity
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.380]   goes on right here on a crystal surface the chemical activity goes on the whole
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:03.300]   crystal surface so it's sort of like a a catalytic surface so it's these are
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:08.020]   very localized and specific a Kim a crystal has basically electrons move
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.740]   around and it acts completely differently when you have a singly dissolved
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.420]   molecule C60 it's it's very unique it has a slight positive to charge but most
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.380]   molecules achieve a positive charge by giving up an electron C60 is different
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.460]   it actually pulls a positively charged hydrogen ion out of the environment and
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.360]   stores it on the inside and then when a negatively charged oxidative radical
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.740]   sticks to the C60 it releases that positively charged ion and neutralizes
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.020]   it back the water or oxygen or some other neutral substance and it's a
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:41.300]   resets itself so it can keep doing this thousands of times before it exits the
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.500]   body because C60 makes really no permanent chemical bonds in the body it
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:51.060]   washes out on an average of 10 days so there you go so the concept here right
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:55.700]   is at C60 because it's like a little cage it's like the little uber driver
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:00.060]   for hydrogen and it transports hydrogen all throughout your body and because it
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.580]   can pass the blood brain barrier it goes everywhere and it just delivers the
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:08.660]   hydrogen and then so because of its charge it's got a negative charge and
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.500]   toxins and pathogens have a positive charge the one as soon as a pathogen
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:19.420]   sticks to the C60 the C60 will do an electron transfer right to the to the
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.620]   toxic substance or the pathogen neutralize it right and it just you know
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.860]   basically breaks down into its common elements and then then CCC goes and
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.620]   captures another little hydrogen ion and then does it again and that's what's
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:37.500]   the beauty of C60 it's just this incredibly you know little miracle of a
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:42.900]   of an atom or sorry molecule that will act as an incredible free radical
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:48.100]   scavenger in your body because of this C60 and hydrogen they work together and
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.820]   that's my point and the other point I want to make is what happens if you
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.700]   don't have enough hydrogen so you just you know if we look at the sources of
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:59.980]   hydrogen in our bodies alright obviously we'll get it through breathing and you
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.460]   know if you've ever done a martial arts or done any of the air Vedic arts like
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.020]   yoga you'll understand that there's multiple different ways to breathe and
[00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.820]   a lot of people don't breathe very well and it's kind of silly that we all
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.620]   breathe 24 hours a day but you know really taking a deep breath emptying out
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.940]   the bottom of your lungs so forth etc you don't know if you've taken that but
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.900]   so we all breathe right so we're all taking in hydrogen all the time but then
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.740]   hydrogen also comes from all the water we drink and especially hydrogen comes
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.580]   from the fiber we eat so between these three things and especially it's kind
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:34.220]   of like look at it like two-thirds of our hydrogen intake is based on do you
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:39.460]   drink a lot of water and you eat a lot of fiber and if you discuss the standard
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.500]   American diet and the standard American and I don't know if this is the true in
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.780]   the rest of the planet but you know people aren't that you know their
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.740]   proclivity is not towards water and fiber and so that's why you know there
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.980]   was this recommendation in the original days where it said hey whenever you take
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.340]   C60 eat an apple and so what was the reason behind that fiber and it's the
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.740]   reason behind fiber hydrogen but here's the thing if you're one if you're a
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:05.940]   standard American diet individual and you have a you can literally have a
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.980]   hydrogen deficiency and so the deficient body that's deficient on
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:15.380]   hydrogen basically cannot assimilate water fatty nutrients and blocks block
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.220]   and body lacks material which is vitamins to joints marrow marrow nerves
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:25.180]   brain this is a deficiency in hydrogen in addition it adds in additionally
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.540]   auditory structures and other body parts need lubrication for optimum
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:33.180]   movement but here's some signs of hydrogen deficiency so if this describes
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:39.180]   you I'm gonna I'm gonna make a point if you have amaciation crampy tendons
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:45.380]   appetite for salty foods irritability yeah dried wrinkled skin lack of
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:50.940]   perspiration gout arthritis excessive body heat and shrinkage of the liver
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:55.900]   you might have a deficiency in hydrogen and what's the point that I'm trying to
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:01.380]   make in what we have learned about C60 well the C60 needs hydrogen to work and
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.940]   if you don't have if you're deficient in hydrogen and you have some of these
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.980]   symptoms then in and you're taking C60 you're not getting the optimal benefit
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.860]   that C60 can give you that's my point so you know I just really want to stress
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:19.380]   how important C60 hydrogen they need to go together so if you're gonna be
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:24.220]   taking C60 by all means make sure you eat a high fiber diet and you drink a
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.900]   lot of water right and that will actually make the C60 do better for you
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.860]   or perform better for you okay point mate now the next point I want to talk about
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:38.900]   it what we have learned in the last few years is C60 oil production methods and
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:43.380]   this is something that really started again in 2012 when the rat study came
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.580]   out and this is right here this is how the rat study did it they basically took
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:52.940]   C60 that they bought from SES and they added it to extra virgin olive oil they
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:57.180]   stirred the on a magnetic stir they stirred the solution for two weeks in
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:01.820]   the dark we covered this the whole light issue so they knew to keep it dark then
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:07.660]   they put it in a centrifuge at 5g at five times gravity for one hour and then
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:12.580]   after that they filtered it through a 0.25 micron millipore filter and that was
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:16.900]   it and then that's what they gave to the rats and so now in the last three
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.060]   years you know and I'm sort of the guy on YouTube that's done more videos about
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.080]   this than anybody you know but you know a lot of us and you know the longevity
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:29.180]   guys and all of us do it at home guys you know we've been making your own C60
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.600]   oil and I've been tinkering and testing and experimenting for three years now
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.980]   okay and and and basically I'm plugged into how everyone else is doing it what
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.860]   their results are and so here are the things that what we have learned about
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:47.580]   making your own C60 oil at home is in the last three years and so one of the
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:51.860]   first things is if you want an optimal output product at the end when you're
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.880]   done then what we've learned is obviously you want to you know you want to
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.680]   pulverize and this is so important and I haven't done a video about this yet
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:05.360]   sorry but you know if you pulverize your C60 before you add it to the oil then
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.680]   you'll get a how much you'll get not a much but I higher saturation rate than
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.320]   you would have if you didn't and you can decrease your stir time and of course
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.640]   we know we in the first part part one we talked about solvent free clearly you
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.960]   want to go with the solvent free option so if you're gonna be buying C60 get a
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.100]   solvent free and if you can get it pulverized or pulverize it yourself for
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:30.240]   better results now the thing about the olive oil as I talked about in the other
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.680]   video you know it's it's so important that the olive oil is authentic that it's
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:41.240]   real olive oil and there's actually a I just posted a Dr. Berg video I'll put
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.300]   that in the video description again about how to determine whether or not
[00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:49.100]   your olive oil is authentic it's super important because it's more the odds are
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.080]   it's not if you go to the grocery store most likely you won't find real olive
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.060]   oil there they'll mix it with some other kind of oil right but so it's got to be
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:00.140]   authentic it's got to be real and most importantly and well not secondly it's
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.160]   got to be fresh all right you know because if you've been sitting on that
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.620]   store shelf for too long you're getting partially rancid oil you're not going
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.140]   to get an optimum product when you're done and that's the whole point right
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.740]   you're gonna be ingesting this for your health got to do it right now the next
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.820]   thing about the stirring again if you're using pulverized C60 if you're just
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.500]   using regular powdered C60 and you just sprinkle it in well you know it's gonna
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.860]   take two weeks just like in the body study right that's the body was one of
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.260]   the scientists but if you pulverize it what I've learned in the last few years
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.100]   is that you really reduce it you can actually get it down to one week so you
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.020]   can you can save a lot of time by just pulverizing the C60 before you put it
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.980]   in and then again I want to point out again what SES discovered was if it's a
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:47.740]   large volume of C60 oil you're gonna go longer you're gonna go three weeks okay
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:51.340]   so you know if you're just doing a leader at a time big difference right and then
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.980]   you want to do you want to most importantly you want to minimize the
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:59.620]   exposure of your oil to air you know you know because oxygen will oxidize the
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:04.300]   oil it'll also oxidize the C60 so you want to keep it airtight now what the
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.700]   commercial producers do is they'll pump in nitrogen I know some folks do you
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:14.680]   are gone but they use different you know air gases or nitrogen and things like
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.340]   that where they'll just pump that into their into their vats so that there's
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.980]   no air at all and they need to keep the air so you minimize exposure to air and
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.900]   oxygen right slash oxygen during the stirring process another thing that's
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.180]   really pertinent that I've learned in the last or what we have learned as a
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:35.580]   community in the last you know few years is as you're stirring and this is
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.860]   something that I've been tinkering around with I got I upgraded my my magnetic
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.180]   stirs last year where I've got one that actually has a really really nice it's
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.500]   full on you know lab quality as opposed to the little inexpensive blue ones we
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:53.220]   all started with I got a lab quality one where I could add heat I could I could
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:57.820]   dial it into the precise you know amount of heat and precise rotations
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:02.820]   per hour all that you know permanent and so for the really nice stir and I've
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.500]   discovered by tinkering around and I've made four batches now and I'm going to
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.020]   record the fifth I wanted to make sure it was consistent my results were
[00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:14.160]   consistent it'll be a video coming out in the future but then I discovered that
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:20.700]   by adding heat to the stir process guess what I've got my stirs down to 24
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.500]   hours I literally 24 hours if you pulverize it and you add heat and I'll do
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:30.100]   that video you can get your stir times down to 24 hours you know for one
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.820]   liter all right so it's pretty cool and I've actually been able to prove it you
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.820]   know I've done four batches already and it came out I did one with avocado oil
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:44.620]   one with udo's oil one with a mix of avocado and coconut and then I made one
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:49.020]   with olive oil and they all came out the same the oil came out as a quality
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:54.740]   finished product with only a 24 hour stir with heat okay so that was pretty
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.940]   amazing and so I think that's kind of a cool development most recently it has
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.980]   been doing that that was my summer project okay now the one thing to about
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:08.140]   stirring is used a beaker not a flask as I pointed out earlier flask will create
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:12.540]   dead zones where the CCC gets trapped in there and won't get into solution so
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.620]   use a straight wall beaker if I've learned anything that's number one okay
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.420]   is use a straight wall beaker I don't use flasks anymore at all except
[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:24.500]   filtering okay so just use straight wall beakers make sure you know I just put
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.780]   you know cellophane on top and cover cover it and make sure it's dark and then
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:32.020]   again to one other thing about magnetic stirs is that you know I've learned a
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.460]   lot about magnetic stirs in the last three years and I'll tell you what you
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.980]   get one that's rated for three liters well yeah it's three liters of water so
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:44.140]   one that's rated for three liters of water it barely stirs 500 milliliters of
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.380]   oil okay because of the viscosity of the fluid so you know if you need to make
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.980]   sure that whatever you're using and the quantity you're putting on it like
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:56.340]   those little blue cheap ones right you can't put a liter of oil on top of that
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.700]   guy it's rated for three liters but you put a liter of oil it won't stir it
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.820]   you've got to do I only can stir 500 milliliters of oil on one of those little
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:09.380]   blue guys those little bluster because it that's the maximum it can happen and
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:13.660]   the key the key to knowing whether or not your stir can handle it is you need
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.580]   when it starts stirring you need to see a dimple on the surface you don't want
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:21.380]   a deep funnel like a tornado because that's going to be sucking air into
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:25.300]   solution you don't want that you just want to see this little dimple on the
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:30.020]   top of the oil while stirring and then you know that the whole beaker full of
[00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.780]   oil is moving around if you don't see that dimple then only the bottom parts
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:38.140]   mixing and you're not going to get C 60 into solution and you're gonna have a
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:42.080]   very poor quality finished product okay so that's really important now the
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:47.620]   other thing to you know about step three was you know if nobody owns us and we're
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.220]   humans right we know how many of you guys own a centrifuge I certainly don't
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.900]   want to buy one especially one that can process a leader at a time and I'd be
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.580]   really expensive and so you know the whole idea and then what we've discovered
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:01.500]   over time in the last three years that you could replicate this 5g for one
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:06.620]   hour just by letting it sit dark place right put covered up and just let it
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:10.940]   sit after you stir for 10 days and what that sort of does and that's kind of
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.820]   the optimum number of days it could be two weeks if you know whatever I usually
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:20.140]   just go to the next weekend or whatever but the idea though is that it simulates
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:26.180]   so so 5g for one hour versus like 1g for 10 days you know it's sort of the
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.580]   same thing you let that whatever's suspended in solution that's not been
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.340]   turned in the lipo full ring you let that settle to the bottom only if you
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:39.100]   added too much now if you add precisely 0.8 milligrams per milliliter or just
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:45.340]   0.8 grams to a full liter right because then and you stir that up you really
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.860]   won't even if you settle it you won't find anything on the bottom so there's
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.180]   some question about whether or not you need to do that in my perspective but
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.820]   bottom line is I let everything settle just to be sure now the last part about
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:01.500]   step four on the body method in the rat study was that they filtered through a
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:07.220]   0.25 micro millipore micron millipore filter all right and there's an interview
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.740]   out there with Fati Musa one of the scientists of the rat study where he
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:15.460]   tells the interviewer that it's not necessary to filter only if and they
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.460]   were filtering because they needed to have the exact you know they needed to
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:23.740]   know that every single batch of oil or C 60 oil that they were giving the rats
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:28.380]   was exactly the same right because of the whole stirring issue in the in the
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:33.460]   dead zones and you know all that stuff I just said so if you don't filter then
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:37.860]   you don't have a consistency in terms of you know exactly what's in the oil
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:43.540]   because what the filter will do it is real remove any large particulates in the
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:48.900]   in the oil okay and so that you know you have exactly the same product every
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.220]   single time and now for commercial sellers who you know have have their
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.740]   act together they're filtering because they need to know that hey you know this
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.500]   is we have to produce the same thing every time because you know it's standard
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:06.100]   equality okay and then for home people it's optional and what I found out and
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.620]   what I have learned in the last few years is that it really is optional
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.220]   because some people you know you don't you just let it settle pour off the top
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:17.260]   you're good to go all right and then for other people you know you got to
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:24.420]   remember that a 0.25 microns is you know it is is 250 nanometers and what does
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:30.020]   that mean that if you filter it through a 0.25 micron filter you still will have
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:36.820]   particulates under 250 nanometers but you could have up to 249 mil no I'm sorry
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:41.820]   nanometer particulate suspended in the oil even after you filter and that's it's
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:47.860]   kind of large I mean pulverized C60 is usually down to like 130 nanometers but
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.900]   you could literally have some pretty large particulates either some impurities
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:55.980]   in the oil or residual C60 or whatever floating around in there and it still
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.580]   would be there and what I have learned and this is and I've actually had a
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.020]   couple of people confirm they have the same issue is that if you're prone to
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:08.660]   kidney stones then it's kind of like think about kidney stones it's like a
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:14.220]   bucket full of pebbles right or or little rocks and then that's kind of how
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.940]   your kidneys look or basically right and so you know fluids flushing through the
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:21.380]   bucket because there's plenty of holes between the rocks and the pebbles but if
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:25.900]   you start taking something that's got smaller particulates so let's say you
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.740]   dump a bunch of sand in that same bucket you know how well is the flu or the
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:33.020]   water gonna flow through that bucket now that's full of sand pebbles and rocks
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:37.220]   so you don't want to you don't you basically bottom line my point is if you
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:43.860]   have kidney stone issues filter because personally I went like six or eight
[00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.620]   months where I wasn't filtering and it gave me a kidney stone because all of
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:52.220]   these particulates got jammed up in my kidneys and so I had a problem but you
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.780]   know and so that's that's only for folks and that's my what I have learned
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.700]   personally and a couple other people I know that have told me they had the same
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:03.620]   experience so otherwise it's just optional if you don't have any problems
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:08.860]   with that you don't need to filter and and there you go okay so now let's talk
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:13.180]   about sonication what do we have learned so if you know if you've been
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:17.260]   following my videos you know that you know I basically tinkered around it's
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:21.420]   one of the first things I theorized because when I read the rat study I
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.820]   theorize well you know I I make liposomal vitamin C all the time using a
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.460]   sonicator I wonder if you could make you know CCT oil using a sonicator and
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.900]   sure enough I went and bought a big one and I started making CCT oil with
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.660]   sonication and discovered that there were about three or four different C60
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:40.620]   commercial producers using ultrasonic so it's like okay and so it did and it
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:45.300]   works I mean it worked fine and I made C60 oil with sonicators for quite a
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.500]   while and then so but you know as I look back over time and I start doing more of
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.460]   that you know like let's read the studies about this as opposed to let's
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.500]   just tinker and jump in with both feet what the studies tell us in in in when
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:03.220]   you put oil in an ultrasonic sonicator here's three different studies I just
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.980]   randomly pulled up when you when I went and did a research like okay you know
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.140]   oils and ultrasound you know do a search like that and and here's one
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.620]   called study of ultrasonic treatment and temperature and lipid modification and
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.060]   their conclusions you know therefore ultrasound could increase the tear
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:22.140]   deterioration of food lipids in another study was different edible oils all of
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.420]   sunflower soybeans show significant changes in their composition chemical
[00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:31.460]   and flavor due to ultrasonic treatment and here's another study that says the
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:36.020]   study shows an increase of formed radicals in sonicated oils as well as
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:40.420]   the modifications of physiochemical parameters evidencing and oxidation of
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:46.980]   treated oil so it doesn't you know the studies are not that favorable you know
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:52.220]   towards using a sonicator for C60 oil and maybe it works okay for liposomal
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.700]   vitamin C because you're using lethicin or lecithin and not oil okay and then
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.260]   there's one other thing you know that the video that I mentioned with Chris
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:04.860]   Burris of SES with Gwen Foster if you listen to that video he also talks about
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:09.900]   sonication and one other property of sonication is if it when you have
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:14.300]   ultrasonics and they encounter a micro air bubble and it bursts that bubble
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:19.060]   will it because it's so small and and the frequencies hit that thing and
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:23.140]   exploded it creates a really high temperature micro burst inside the oil
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.380]   and that and that part of the reasons that you have this oxidation is because
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:33.220]   of those little you know I mean it's it's a we're talking micro burst right but
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:39.380]   but it's extremely high heat and really really nanoparticle size and it's out
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.900]   throughout the oil and that that might be one of the reasons of oxidation but
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.100]   at the end of the day okay and you know Chris talks about if you want to listen
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:50.900]   to it at the end of the day the science studies do not support
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:56.980]   using ultrasonic you know sonicators to make C60 oil that's the what we have
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:01.700]   learned and then the other thing too personally I stopped using sonicators
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:06.580]   before I ever read the studies okay because it's sort of a hassle I mean you
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:10.420]   know I bought one well I bought a three liter one and you know got to remember
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:15.780]   now you're putting C60 oil in a flask in a bath of water so when you have a
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:20.100]   three liter ultrasonic machine it holds quote three liters of water
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.260]   in the bath and you put and so what happens is is with three liter
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.980]   ultrasonic you know it costs like a hundred and sixty dollars
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:31.300]   it only processes 500 milliliters of oil at a time
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.620]   because the bath is so small and if you want one that holds a leader at a time
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.580]   you're going to spend three or four hundred dollars on this machine
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:42.980]   and it just doesn't make any sense and so what happened when I was doing it
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.300]   was every time I went to sonicate oil I'd have to run it twice
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:51.540]   and first of all when that thing's running it just like jars your teeth
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.340]   but the whole idea is you got to pull out the machine fill it up full water
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.660]   get the temperature right put the oil in
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.940]   turn it on and then you got to make sure that it doesn't get too hot
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:03.220]   and then you got to do it twice to just get one liter of oil done
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.340]   and then then you got to you know empty it out and put it away you know it
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.900]   bottom line it just became a real hassle
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:13.220]   we're as opposed to pulver I see sixty added to oil put it on a stir
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.220]   and you're done let you know set it and forget it and I've got to tell you I'm
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:20.420]   lazy and so I just have gravitated towards
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:23.460]   only stirring and not using my sonicators
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.740]   because it's just too much of a hassle and then on top of this now that I've
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.380]   read the studies I'm not I'm probably not going to be using
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.780]   sonicators again and that's what we have learned
[00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:35.860]   about C60 oil and and using sonication so there
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:41.380]   there's that now let's talk about what we have learned about the C60 product
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.500]   evolution so if you've watched my series I did a
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:49.380]   three-part series called alt C60 which I covered the alternative C60 products
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:53.620]   on the market today and so what we have learned is that C60 is expanding
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:58.100]   beyond just the concept of a C60 oil you ingest and that there are other ways
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:02.180]   to benefit from C60 either through topical
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:06.980]   whether there's facial oils and body creams and face creams
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.820]   and so forth which are these are some exceptional products by the way I
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.020]   really like the the Akasha brand which is the Layla
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:18.260]   C60 Layla lab C60 I use these products daily I use
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:24.100]   the C60 labs makes a cream that that it's like I use that daily I mean I
[00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:28.820]   it's really awesome and actually helps with eczema it's pretty cool it's got C60
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:32.900]   in it so there's some C60 topical so not only can you take the oil
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.300]   through ingestion but you also can apply it as a topical
[00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:41.380]   and so we've seen this evolution and what we've learned is that it works
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:45.380]   and that there's a demand for it so there's the C60 topical environment
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.260]   that's out there right now and most recently this year
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:54.900]   sorry this year live longer labs came out with the concept of doing atomized C60
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:34:00.020]   oil so getting just this is just your typical atomizer and if you put C60 oil
[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:04.420]   and this is specific specifically you have to filter the oil this you have to
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.860]   make sure you filter the oil but if you take filtered C60 oil
[00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.580]   and you put it in an atomizer and you inhale
[00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:16.260]   the atomized C60 it does wonderful things for people with asthma
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.180]   and and breathing issues and things like that I use this whenever I get
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:26.180]   congested it works awesome so you can breathe in C60 atomized C60
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.140]   is something that we've learned that hey that works it's pretty cool
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:33.060]   and then there's this kind of like offshoot where there's a C60 frequency
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:38.420]   the molecular frequency of C60 and if you go to this site that sells the
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.540]   you know the audio is for it you know there's some testimonials on there
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.980]   about people who are literally experiencing benefits
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:48.580]   by listening to you know by basically exposing themselves to the frequency of
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.620]   C60 I'm on the fence about this because I'm just not
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:55.700]   you know not really sure I'm not really sure about you know putting on a set of
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.900]   headphones and I'm going to get a C60 effect I'm just
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:03.060]   I kind of have a I don't know about that but you know but hey you know what
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:06.900]   if it works for some people it works that's awesome but the idea though
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:10.980]   is that we've learned that there's different ways you can take C60
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.500]   and it just gets you know there's just new ones all the time and it's it's
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.660]   pretty cool you know I think you know if you think back towards like
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.460]   you know when they discovered C60 did they you know did they ever even
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:25.380]   conceive the idea that it would become you know this this this expansive in
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:29.780]   terms of how C60 would be used you know in terms of health and and
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.580]   all of these different ways to take it I think it's really amazing
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:36.500]   the product evolution over time and that we've learned that it it works in
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.540]   all these different ways people are actually getting something from it
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.820]   now in terms of topicals I do want to chat about one thing that I thought was
[00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:46.020]   really interesting in the research was that in this one study it said the
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.980]   skin penetration of end kinetics of pristine fullerenes
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.020]   topically exposed in industrial organic solvent so
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:57.060]   what these guys did was they basically they they they they tested
[00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:04.500]   um the effect of of C60 topically when using different forms of
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.180]   solvents now some of the solvents are pretty nasty solvents
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.220]   and they use mineral oil which obviously is fine
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.820]   so but the idea was is they wanted to see how well does skin
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:19.220]   how well does C60 penetrate skin okay and so as I was reading this thing what
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.820]   was interesting to me was this is the quote that the dose sites were tape
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:26.260]   stripped and skin biopsies were taken after 26 tape strips
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.460]   for quantitative analysis when dose and toluene
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:33.700]   cyclohexane or chloroform pristine fullerenes penetrated
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.900]   okay this is important pristine pentate fullerenes penetrated
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:42.340]   deeply into the stratum corneum and the primary barrier of skin more
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:46.100]   CCC was detected in the stratum corneum when dosed in chloroform
[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:50.900]   compared to toluene or cytohexane but this is where my point is
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:56.980]   fullerenes were not detected in skin when dosed in mineral oil
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:02.100]   okay so how are all these topicals made well these topicals are made
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.500]   with C60 in oil added to a bunch of other healthy
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.580]   you know other stuff that's good for your skin
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:12.340]   so I got the thinking that okay well you know what this is interesting
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:17.060]   because we know that from part one that C60 in cosmetics started like way
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:22.820]   back in 1995 or around there by a company called vitamin C60 it's a
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:26.020]   Japanese firm and they make a product called
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:30.580]   like I think they call it ROS sponge or something like that
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.060]   they also trademarked the word lipo fulleren
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.740]   anyway they sell this product so that it's an ingredient in cosmetics and so
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:39.860]   I was thinking that you know you know this is interesting because here's a
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.300]   study that says C60 doesn't penetrate if it's an oil
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:46.100]   and so but it doesn't mean it doesn't mean that it doesn't work it just
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.980]   doesn't go deep into your skin it doesn't get into where the
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:53.620]   where your capillaries are so that you can actually take a dose of C60
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.260]   like you would ingesting where it gets into your bloodstream and travels
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:00.100]   around your body but that if you use a topical what this implies
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.940]   is that it primarily just does radical you know it just does ROS scavenging a
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.180]   radical oxygen species free radical and it just kind of just
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.220]   treats the oxidation on the surface of your skin
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.500]   right that's my point and so that's got me thinking that okay maybe all of the
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.860]   topicals sort of are just topicals where they only treat
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:21.140]   you know free radical damage on the surface of your skin and maybe just a
[00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:24.100]   little bit lower but it doesn't penetrate
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.620]   based on this study so I've done some experiments since that in the last
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:30.180]   couple of months and because it just kind of was you know this study was like
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:34.180]   really made me thinking and if you know I've done three videos already about
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:38.260]   C60 topicals I'm kind of a little OCD about C60 and topical
[00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:43.140]   ever since I had that lab accident so here's what I've learned okay what we
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:47.380]   have learned is that well first of all it might not
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:51.860]   go deep using oil and so how would you make it go deep so in other words
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:56.260]   how would I want if I wanted to do a targeted application of C60
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:00.340]   let's say to my knee which I have like kind of like a bum knee
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:04.100]   from an accident I had and so I was thinking well how do I
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:08.180]   you know I take C60 every day but how do I just you know saturate the heck out
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.940]   of my knee with C60 and I was using this and then I was
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:15.300]   thinking well if this is true then that doesn't work as well
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.420]   as if I maybe got used something called a penetrator
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.940]   which is an additional additive that you can add to the C60
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.180]   that then that goes deep into the skin and then would carry the C60 with it
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:30.180]   as a carrier right so now when I you know when I did the lab accident and all
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.940]   you guys remember that video you know I was using pulverized C60 and it
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:39.060]   was suspended in 100% denatured alcohol I mean 100% 200 proof alcohol
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:43.220]   right and and so I spilled this on my hands and
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.580]   didn't sleep for two days and I went into full what we
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.860]   would now call Lucy mode from the movie Lucy
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.940]   just space I mean it was like really it's hard to explain but you go into this
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.780]   look zone and you're there for a long time and you can't sleep
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.820]   and you're basically on it you're like the you're the best
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:07.140]   view version of you you could be and so that's called mega dosing C60 I don't
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:10.180]   recommend it okay especially if you like to sleep at night
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.620]   but I did this to myself and I realized hey you know what alcohol works as a
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:17.380]   penetrator but it's pretty harsh okay I mean you don't want alcohol on your
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.860]   skin and that sort of thing so but it worked
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:23.460]   and that was the thing I was thinking well if it doesn't work with oil
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.340]   then why not use a penetrator so these are my experiments and I just want to
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.980]   share with you what I've learned is that I did learn
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:32.820]   that pulverized C60 and alcohol will penetrate the skin get into your blood
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.140]   stream and you will feel an effect in your brain
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:39.380]   now and so my most recent experiment now I've been doing two other experiments
[00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:43.700]   and I just want to share with you the results is that I decided that okay if
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:47.140]   what if I take just just you know instead of like mixing it with all these
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.820]   other beautiful creams and and yo yo bah and all this other stuff that's
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:55.300]   really great oils for your skin and I just take the C60 oil and I just add
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.900]   transcutal which is a skin penetrator just like DMSO
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:03.220]   and these are two additives that will then act as a carrier and draw C60
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.780]   deep into your skin you know if you do the studies on
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.860]   these two and I by the way I did a video about that
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.460]   and if you want to learn more about penetrators I did a whole video on it
[00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:16.900]   okay so anyway so I just made this concoction the other day
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.620]   and this is what it came out to and one of the there's two things I wanted to
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:24.180]   know was how much you know if I did mix transcutal with C60 oil
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.460]   what would be the saturation rate of the transcutal in other words would it
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.420]   mix into solution and not just mix but hold into
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.260]   solution so I added 20 milliliters of transcutal to 40
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:38.500]   milliliters of C60 oil that I'd made and what happened was I discovered that it
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.740]   does uh that you know here's when I was finished
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:44.020]   stirring and I was stirred for 24 hours and then I let it sit for five days to
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:47.380]   see if they would separate and they did it and so what came out from the study
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:52.260]   when I removed the transcutal is I determined that that if you did this
[00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:56.420]   the C60 oil will saturate transcutal or sorry the other way around transcutal
[00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:59.940]   will saturate into C60 oil 11.1 percent of the
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.140]   transcutal was gone it went into solution and I pulled out the
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:08.740]   weather the 89 88.9 percent of the transcutal I extracted from
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:13.380]   solution so there was an ability for when you do this you will actually be
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:17.380]   able to get transcutal into solution with C60
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:21.220]   in olive oil so that was my goal so this the second thing was is okay hey that
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.660]   worked cool so the second idea was okay well then obviously I'm going to use
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:28.340]   it so I put it on my knee and you know what with it with like I put it on my
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.060]   knee and prior to that I was using a scener
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:34.020]   and I wasn't getting the the benefits I was normally going to get from the
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.900]   scener because I'd really just screwed up my knee this time
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.580]   and so I did put it on and I would say and this is anecdotal
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:44.020]   that it did help with the pain that the pain went away after 24 hours and I
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:47.780]   put it on for a few days and then it really kept the
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:52.820]   pain at bay and so I think that that's a relationship if you study C60
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.620]   then you will know that hey guess what C60 is good for
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:58.740]   inflammation so obviously the inflammation went down and the pain went
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:02.020]   down that's my theory okay so I felt that it did really well
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:05.540]   but you know what what it but it didn't but it didn't cure it that was the
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.860]   thing I mean you know so I still have the I've been
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:11.140]   treating my knee for quite a while now but I'm just saying that I believe it
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:14.020]   did anecdotally reduce inflammation and thus
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:17.620]   reduce pain so this concoction was kind of helpful and I got a little
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:21.140]   little bottle of it here on on on my desk and I use it every day
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.260]   okay now the other thing too is I've been doing this experiment using pulver
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.260]   I see 60 where I would just pulver I see 60
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:36.020]   in different carriers but then at DMSO afterwards and that definitely works
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:40.660]   the DMSO works really well to carry the C60 into it but then
[00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:45.540]   we're doing that it gave me this really weird rash so I'm not really happy
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:48.180]   about about that experiment so right now I'm just
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:51.620]   what have I learned is that that seems to work better
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.260]   that's that's it I don't want to go too far I
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.820]   I really get kind of carried away on C60 topicals
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:00.580]   okay so now let's talk about what else have we learned about the product
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:03.220]   evolution of C60 so you know obviously it all
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:06.020]   started with C60 in olive oil due to the rat study
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.820]   but ever since then you know look at all the different oils that are currently
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.140]   on the market right now everything from almond
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:15.220]   down to sunflower hemp oil CBD black seed oil pumpkin seed oil
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:19.700]   and so these are all the oils and what does this mean is that hey C60
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.460]   will basically enter into into these different these other oils are good with
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.620]   C60 people are buying them and that you're able to
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:31.060]   mix C60 with a lot more oils other than olive
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.940]   but the thing about it though if you look at the science behind it
[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:38.740]   everyone has already confirmed olive oil is the most
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:42.820]   optimum oil for C60 there's something about the polyphenols and the
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:46.500]   and the long chain try just try glyceride combinations and olive oil
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:51.140]   that are make make it very unique okay so that it's like the best companion for
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:55.140]   C60 but that doesn't stop other folks from saying well I'll just mix C60 with
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:58.740]   this other oil and get the benefit of that particular oil
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:02.500]   along with the C60 and so that's some of the things that we're seeing in that
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.220]   you know it does work you can put it in these different oils
[00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:08.900]   it will saturate into into these oils and it will carry it
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:12.340]   just like it would if it was olive oil okay so you're seeing that that's the
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:14.660]   product evolution and we're learning that it you can do
[00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:17.460]   a lot more different oils we're also learning that the capsule
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:20.980]   market kind of works out really well but one of the things that we've learned
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:25.780]   about the capsule market is that if you know that taking C60 and olive oil
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.260]   in capsules it just doesn't make any sense at all
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.140]   because you won't you know you have to take five capsules just to get one
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:34.100]   teaspoon and it just doesn't make any sense at all and you don't get any
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:37.220]   additional benefit other than you're just going to be eating a lot of
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:40.420]   gelatin right but here's the thought though capsules of
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:47.220]   other specifically different oils right gives you the benefit of that oil
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:50.740]   in the doses that you would normally take it in like black seed
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:54.180]   right so you know like for this product right here I tried two bottles of it
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:57.700]   took three a day for two months and I got to tell you I had the most
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:02.500]   incredible digestive experience that I've ever had because this thing was
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:07.140]   awesome in regards to my digestive health and that was the black seed oil
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:10.420]   on top of the C60 so it's more so from the black seed oil
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:14.100]   than the C60 but I'll tell you what the combination was amazing
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:19.140]   and so you know I really think that I think encapsulation of C60 oils
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:22.500]   is going to be good we're seeing that it works
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:26.180]   but the whole thing was is from a practical standpoint it works better
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:30.180]   with let's say boutique oils than it would with olive because you're just
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:33.220]   not going to get a benefit taking capsules of olive oil C60
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:36.900]   but you will if it's a specialty oil and that oil does something
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:40.500]   unique okay because no one's going to take a teaspoon of black seed oil by
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.380]   mouth unless you really really like torturing yourself
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:46.660]   okay so then we also seeing that what we learned
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.100]   is that people are now putting additives now this has been going on for a little
[00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.900]   while with the it originally started with
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.980]   hell you know at carbon 60 plus but oh I'm sorry live pet
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:01.220]   it's part of the whole iron Mitchell companies he's got three different
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.940]   brands right and so anyway so one of the things about
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.700]   additives and even with this one this one is C60 and black oil plus
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:11.860]   acethaaxin but this one right here and you'll see one on live longer labs does
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:15.700]   one with curcumin but this one is the health C360
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:19.380]   product called Revive and there's a one for women called Rejuvenate
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:22.820]   and they've added a different ingredients in here
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:26.740]   and so in addition to the lipofluorine which is a C60 in oil
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:30.260]   you've got paptase el carnosine and coq10
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:34.340]   and so these other different additives provide additional benefits in
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:39.380]   conjunction with lipofluorine produce basically an enhanced effect so it's
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:43.140]   like C60 with other stuff makes the C60 better
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:48.020]   right and so there's a video I highly encourage if you have not
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:52.500]   seen this two-hour interview with iron Mitchell on the Luke story
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:56.260]   show the video link below there's a link for it
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:00.100]   it's it's awesome and where he goes into great detail about how each one of
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.340]   these work biologically and how and and what's the reason that they did this
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:09.060]   and how it all works together in terms of basically helping you improve your
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:13.460]   health but also repair damage to your body and it's just pretty amazing
[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:16.660]   and they did the science behind it you know like I mentioned earlier in part one
[00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.500]   they have a commercial lab they got two of them
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:22.180]   there's another professional scientist working with universities
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:25.380]   making commercial products and they did the research
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:28.340]   and he describes that research in which additives
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:32.820]   when you blend them in with C60 oil it just the overall effect is
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:36.820]   way more pronounced than just taking C60 that's what we have learned is
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:41.060]   additives are awesome with C60 now the last thing is that pets it's
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:46.980]   great for pets the original C60 oil for pets was actually iron Mitchell's
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:50.260]   company called live pet and now you're seeing more and more
[00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.900]   commercial producers start making products for pets
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:56.420]   and so here's the one from SES and I think that what we have learned above
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.620]   anything else and there are a lot of great testimonials
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:03.940]   about how well C60 works for horses and cats and dogs
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:08.980]   is that it is awesome for pets as well as humans and if if you have an older
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:12.900]   dog an older cat or or a horse you know it's
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.940]   awesome for these critters I'm sure for other critters as well
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.980]   and so you know it's something to think about and that's what we've learned is
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:23.860]   hey you know what it's great for pets now let's talk about
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:28.100]   where do we go from here and I just want to say we're at the 49-minute mark and
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:31.460]   I apologize this thing's gotten really long because there's so much content
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:35.380]   but I wanted to squeeze this in because it's part of the what we have learned
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:39.060]   because what we have learned now will determine the future of what will
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:43.220]   where we go from here and so I want to apologize for the extra long video
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:47.860]   right now because I really wanted to squeeze this in and not make a part three
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:53.140]   because where we go from here with C60 is probably
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.500]   one of the most amazing things from all the research that I've done and again
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:00.340]   you know it took a month to do part one it's taken equally as long
[00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:05.860]   to do part two and and so I want to cover this and this is so important
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.380]   where do we go from here where does the C60 industry go
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:13.860]   where's the science taking us and I think it's just a fascinating
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:18.340]   you know research that I did and I just I'm so excited to share it with you
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:22.420]   so here's my first thoughts right is right off the bat where do we go from
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:26.980]   here 2021 and beyond well when you look at the C60 oil market
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:30.100]   I think what we're going to see is we're going to continue to see new oils
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:33.140]   there's people in the chat rooms talking about hey you know
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:36.100]   using like pine nut oil and different things like that
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:39.620]   which just people keep coming up with which is better ideas
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:42.900]   and how they could mix C60 to oil and get the benefit of both
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.460]   and then also I think we're going to be looking at oil blends I mean there's
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.620]   one individual that posted on the other day on the
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:50.980]   telegram chat room about he made a two-thirds hemp
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:54.660]   one-third pumpkin seed oil blend and it just it
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:58.740]   I think it did something for him that he had a problem with that I forgot the
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:02.900]   exact post but he just was raving about this blend that he discovered
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:06.180]   that he made you know and then he said hey this is great you got to try this
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:10.020]   so we're obviously we're going to try it so you know I think we're going to see
[00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:13.860]   new oils I think will continue to come out in the future
[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:17.860]   I think we're going to see more different olive oil blends
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:22.100]   now in terms of capsules like I mentioned earlier I think that the C60 olive oil
[00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:25.460]   capsule market's going to die off but I think we're going to start seeing more
[00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.980]   C60 oil in capsules from things that you don't
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:33.380]   want to take by mouth oils that taste really bad
[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:37.220]   you're going to see that in capsules and I think that's going to keep going on
[00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:40.740]   I think in terms of additives I mean the sky's the limit I mean the sky's the
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.980]   limit I'm already trying to figure out oh well you
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:47.780]   know what could I add you know to my C60 oil and just as an example I was
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:51.060]   thinking well why don't I make a C60 oil right
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:56.820]   and then put in you know let's say niacin right
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:52:00.100]   nickelton of my micronuclei and add riz or as
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:03.300]   or as real tall right add those two components in there and I want to see
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:07.300]   how well it saturates and then you could create like this little anti-aging
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:11.620]   C60 oil that's got you know those two anti-aging components to it so that's
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:16.420]   kind of one of the things if you watch you know David Blair with with the
[00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:19.700]   I think for us Harvard I think you know talks a lot about you know the
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:23.220]   anti-aging properties of nickelton of mine micronuclei and as
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:26.580]   well as riz or at all and those two comp those two in combinations to
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:30.580]   improve your NAD and your body combined with C60 oil
[00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.820]   amazing right so there's a great idea right there
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:35.060]   you can take that wherever you want to go anybody
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.940]   but I think we're going to see a lot more with additives from the
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:41.780]   from the perspective of C60 topicals I think definitely there will be more
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.020]   new cosmetics coming out I think we're just at the
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:48.740]   I think you know I called it in in 19 sorry 2019 I called 2020
[00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:52.900]   the year of topical C60 and sure enough a whole bunch of new products came out
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:56.180]   that year so I'm going to call 2021 where we're going to see more
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:00.740]   C60 cosmetics but I think you know if anyone takes me up on my whole idea
[00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:04.420]   about the therapeutic use of C60 topicals
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:08.660]   meaning C60s with penetrators that'll you can target an area of your body and
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:12.980]   just really mega dose a particular area of your body with C60
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:17.060]   as a therapeutic I think you know maybe one of you you know
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:21.700]   brilliant minds out there will take my idea take my idea
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:24.900]   and run with it and start making therapeutic products that's just a
[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:27.620]   that's just a prediction I'm hoping that that happens because
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.660]   you know I think it's a great idea now in terms of other things that are
[00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:35.220]   happening that are pretty amazing is when you look at the C60 derivatives
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.900]   okay and so the C60 derivatives out there you're you've got some things
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:42.100]   that are about to launch that are and they're and they're and they're just
[00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:45.300]   they're doing soft launches right now in terms of
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:49.460]   taking C60 and modifying it so that it's no longer a pristine
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:55.140]   C60 molecule meaning a pristine C60 molecule molecule is only 60
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:58.180]   carbon atoms in a fullering cage period right
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:02.500]   but if you add any additional molecules and atoms to that C60 cage
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:06.100]   then it becomes a derivative and so some of the things about these
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:10.420]   derivatives is that they have incredible properties themselves
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.420]   so when you look at the animatostatic serum there's actually been a clinical
[00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:17.860]   trial this has been produced by the Health 360 I and Mitchell
[00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:20.820]   and he's actually done a clinical trial on that the clinical trials in the
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:25.140]   directory that's just amazing I mean it really really really was
[00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:28.340]   very beneficial in combination with a keto diet for dogs
[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:32.020]   in terms of tumor suppression you know you want to you know definitely
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:35.620]   listen to the I and Mitchell interview he talks about his animatostatic serum
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:38.740]   it hasn't hit the market yet but I expected I'm guessing hopefully
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:42.660]   that you'll be able to buy it come 2021 and then there's also the idea of
[00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:45.780]   foreign oils and now foreign oils is another C60 derivatives I'll get more
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:49.780]   into that then there's the idea of a of a fullering
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:53.620]   it's not a C60 molecule but it's a fullering
[00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:57.060]   and I'm covering it in this video about the where do we go from here because
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:01.140]   some of the research coming out about carbon nano onions as it relates to a
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:05.460]   health supplement is pretty amazing so I wanted to share that with you too
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:08.340]   and then we look at C60 optics and so
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:11.860]   optics you know what do I mean by that well I guess what as I was doing my
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:14.580]   research I was going through all the patents right
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.300]   because if you want to know what's going to happen in the future you just
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:20.180]   look at where the patents are follow the patents
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.460]   if people are patenting stuff then they're going to launch their products
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:27.060]   and so what has been approved so far in the patent world
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:32.340]   are C60 patents and one of them is that animatostatic serum right so the
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:35.620]   animatostatic serum there's already a patent for that there's been a patent
[00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:39.940]   on just a creation of lipofluorines a patent on lipofluorine
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:43.780]   solubility and then I found this patent on optical light filters
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:48.180]   using C60 which I thought was amazing you know and so I'll get into that and
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.820]   then of course there's this new one these are all new ones right
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:55.540]   in the last few years on nursing gel you know adding C60 to nursing gel
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:58.500]   for new mothers and things like that just you know like I said more cosmetics
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:01.380]   but therapeutic products and here's an example of that
[00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:04.100]   so these are the patents that already been approved and then there's actually
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:07.140]   some patent applications that are pending approval and they're still
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:10.100]   they're still in the works and so now there's now a
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:14.180]   there's a patent application right now for adding Blackseed Oil MCT and Kirkman
[00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:17.940]   to C60 which goes all along the whole concept additives
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:23.780]   co-oxid inhibitors ketone esters and then there's one for CBD oil or kenobonoids
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:27.700]   right with C60 mixed with kenobonoids so you're seeing people and this is the
[00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:31.380]   thing we got to remember everybody it's only been three years since C60 took
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:35.380]   off as a health supplement so we're saying that hey within three years
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.580]   you've got people and it's like it's like the you know it's like a gold rush
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:41.780]   right people are nailing down these patents
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:45.140]   for some of the products that I've been talking about and if you're out there
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:48.740]   making C60 and you're seriously into it and you've got a lot invested
[00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:52.260]   you seriously need to a read some of these patents
[00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:55.940]   right and or file your own if you've got a unique idea and now I'm just
[00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:59.380]   telling you you need to check this out because if you read this solubility
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:02.980]   patent and I'm not a patent lawyer so this is not advice
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:07.140]   and I'm not a professional patent reader it by any means
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:12.980]   but as I read that patent it looks like that patent covers
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:18.420]   any C60 oil that's got greater than 0.8 milligrams per milliliters which means
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:21.860]   if you're making or you think you're going to launch a product
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:26.180]   that's got like one or two you know grams per liter in it
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.980]   and you want to call it the super saturated you know see
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:32.660]   then you might be infringing on this patent and then on this patent
[00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:36.260]   application if you decide to start doing a black seed oil C60
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:40.500]   or MCT or Kirkman then here's a patent that someone's already filed and said
[00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:44.100]   no no you can't I I patent that right and CBD right
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:48.820]   so people are out there grabbing land uh and so you know grabbing you know
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:51.780]   stake in their flags in the ground on what they're going to claim is theirs
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:54.660]   so if you're out there developing you need to be checking these patents and
[00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:58.020]   you need to protect yourself otherwise you may be infringement and you're
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:00.580]   going to be talking to a lot of lawyers here in the future
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:04.180]   so keep an eye on the patents and let's talk about the next thing I want to
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.660]   talk about and let's talk about foreign oils
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:12.820]   Fuller Knowles okay is a C60 molecule with oxygen hydrogen
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:16.900]   atoms connected to it and there's like a multiple points
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:21.380]   on the C60 molecule that you can add different atoms okay
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:23.540]   so it is it you know so here's the list of different
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:26.100]   fullerenes that are that are out there right now you've got
[00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:30.180]   everything nano diamond diamonds to graphene fullerenes you know
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.420]   but then you've got carbon atoms we'll talk about that but here's the
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:35.700]   fullerene molecule and then this is what it looks like once you start
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:40.020]   adding different atoms to it and that when you start doing it and you have a
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:44.980]   chemical you know chemically modified C60 atom
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:49.060]   I'm sorry molecule that's got oxygen hydrogen molecules on it it's now it's
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:52.580]   called a fullerenol that's what it's called and the end stands for the number
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:56.420]   of pairs of oxygen hydrogen pairs that are attached to it and you can have
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:59:01.940]   anywhere from 2 to like 24 36 okay it all depends on how many
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.660]   different oxygen hydrogen atoms are attached to this
[00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:08.180]   and if once you start attaching it they do different things which is where I
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:11.300]   want to go over that so and when you look at the science
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:14.500]   literature on fullerenals it doesn't look that great and I want to make my
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:18.500]   point is is that you know it's it's out there
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:21.140]   and people are actually creating products or researching to create
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:24.740]   products for it and when you do your when you do your first dive into
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:29.140]   fullerenols you know which is a C60 derivative and you go well gee
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:32.260]   if I look at it I look at like cytotoxicity of water soluble fullerenes
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:35.860]   and vascular endothelial cells these are some studies that come up
[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:38.980]   you know this one studies that we found that fullerene causes cytotoxic
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:44.420]   injury or cell death in vascular ECs you know and then and it goes on
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:46.820]   indicating that exposure to fullerene could represent a risk where
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:52.740]   arthyrosus arthyrosclerosis and is ischemic heart disease
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:56.020]   i think that's how you pronounce that all right so that doesn't sound good
[00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:59.220]   so why would anyone be making a product for you to take a fullerenal if it does
[00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.380]   that and then you've got another one here on this research
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:06.020]   study called binding fullerenal C60OH24 to DNA
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.740]   right and it says hey you know it's fullerenal binds to phosphate
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:12.740]   backpoints outside native DS NNA and to base pairs with major
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:18.340]   groove of sodium salts okay bottom line it it binds to your DNA
[01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:20.900]   don't know about you but I really don't want to be taking anything that's going
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:24.580]   to bind to my DNA so I mean it's like it so it doesn't look good on the
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:29.460]   surface until I ran across a study called review of synthesis and
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:33.700]   antioxidant potential of fullerenal nanoparticles and so what was so
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:37.540]   important in this study that that really kind of like oh I get it now
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:41.140]   why are fullerenal is a where do we go from here
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:46.260]   possible health supplement in the C60 world is because of this
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:48.980]   this data and they did this big giant study
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:52.740]   suggest that the antioxidant effects of fullerenal derivatives depends on
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:56.980]   their chemical structure so when we start taking a look
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:01.860]   okay about cease or about fullerenal uh structures
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:06.260]   what's really really critical here is that is that you can have like I said
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:09.940]   multiple different kinds of fullerenals depending on how many OH
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:13.780]   uh you know molecule pairs are attached to the C60 molecule
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:17.140]   but what's most important in there and there's a there's a there's a table in
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:22.260]   here I want to get to is in this study here you go
[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:27.620]   here you go depending on the fullerenal okay because remember now it's CCOH
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:32.260]   N so depending on the OH pairs attached to the
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:36.580]   fullerenal and also uh it's you know how they deliver it
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:40.100]   okay and and this is oh by the way this is what people mean when they say
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:45.540]   water soluble fullerene or water soluble C60 okay I want to point out
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:50.100]   something that's really confusing the C60 is not water soluble
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:54.340]   you cannot take pristine C60 meaning it's just 60 carbon atoms
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:57.940]   and mix it with water and drink it then you'll just pass it'll just pass right
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:01.460]   through you but if you add OH atoms to it
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:04.820]   okay it becomes water soluble so whenever you hear the phrase
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:10.100]   water soluble C60 it's not C60 it's a fullerenal
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:16.020]   okay very important but here's my point in this study it actually shows
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:21.220]   what different combinations of C60 and OH
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:25.380]   can do in the studies that they've done and so um
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:28.500]   and this is like basically right here like if you look at some of these and
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:31.460]   you've got like I said uh you know you've got some
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:35.220]   microconial dysfunctions you've got some pretty nasty things happening
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:38.660]   depending on the formulation of this of the fullerenal but then you've got
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:42.900]   some incredible stuff happening when you have a specific you know
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:46.660]   formulation so that's the point I want to make is that fullerenal comes in a
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:50.660]   multiple of different flavors and depending on what flavor or color you
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:54.580]   get it's going to do a different thing so that's probably the most important
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:58.260]   takeaway is that as you see these products come on the market it's so
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:01.300]   important to go what kind of fullerenal do you use
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:05.700]   what's in that and and be very very cautious because you know yeah it'd be
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:09.780]   awesome it's be awesome to have neural protective antioxidant effects
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:13.060]   having uh like right here so uh you don't want cell death okay let's
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:17.300]   skip that one uh you know top of G and cell growth yeah I want that effect but
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:21.380]   how do I get it which C60 or which fullerenal do I need to have
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:25.860]   to do that and anti tumor any metastatic activities modulation of oxidative
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:29.780]   stress and tumor tissues that's C60 OH 20
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:33.780]   so this table and this study is so helpful to kind of understand
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:37.060]   fullerenal to demonstrate to you that there are
[01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:41.220]   different kinds of fullerenal and it really depends on which one
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:45.700]   that you're uh you're messing around with uh you know so that you can understand
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:48.500]   hey this is either going to be a good one
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.940]   positive results or this is going to mess me up and so
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:56.580]   it I think that as the different companies that are looking at developing
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:00.660]   this focusing on the good ones and make sure that they don't mix in with any
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.780]   of the mess you up ones you're going to see a I think we're going to see
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:07.620]   fullerenals really take off the good ones okay and so one of the things I
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:11.300]   want to point out to you right now it's already done it's already taking off
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:14.980]   and that's why I see this as a where do you go from here because it's already
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:19.300]   taking off you can already buy fullerenals Solaris and MTR sell it and
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:22.980]   there are already products out there that have it out there so let me
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:26.020]   kind of show you like here's Solaris and Solaris is already
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:31.220]   selling a C60 fullerenal okay and then you've got MTR sells
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:34.180]   fullerenals as well so you can actually buy the raw materials
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:37.700]   to make products but you've got C60 18 through 22
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:42.900]   22 to 26 and you've got four and so here's the 24 one that that was
[01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:46.500]   mentioned in a study so you can buy different fullerenals depending on
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:50.420]   what combination or formula you want and then of course you know for
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:54.980]   making your own by the way I don't intend to do any DIY stuff yet
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.660]   until I get a much better handle on exactly which full and all they use for
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:02.820]   what specific thing I want to create but it's something I'll be thinking with
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.700]   in the future but I'm really kind of cautious about
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:09.700]   because of what I read and then lastly there is actually a product out there
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:13.700]   there is a product right now called uh whatever they call this this
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:17.380]   water-soluble carbon 60 again again they're saying it's C60 it's not
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:20.820]   C60 it's fullerenal uh it is so important and so the
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:23.380]   thing about it though is that they've got the end here
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:26.980]   and nowhere in their literature did they say which full and all it is
[01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:30.100]   so you know if you're going to be going out there and trying some of this
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.980]   you really need to be talking to these guys and saying well what
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:36.900]   full and all did you put in there you know so that you have an understanding
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:40.820]   of okay what you could expect and or make sure you don't get messed up
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:44.500]   now also too in terms of products there's a video uh link in the description
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:48.180]   below uh where uh uh david wolf was on the alphabetic
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:52.580]   show recently and for about 20 minutes he's talking about C60 and in that
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:56.260]   video david wolf also says that his company is
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:59.940]   looking at fullerenals as a product and also looking at carbon nano
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:03.380]   onions as a product so not only do you already have one product on the
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:08.180]   market you've got another one for sure already looking at developing products
[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:12.100]   uh based on fullerenals in terms of where do we go from here so
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:15.540]   i expect this to grow we're going to hear a lot more about fullerenals in the
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:18.900]   future now let's talk about carbon nano onions
[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:23.540]   now carbon nano onions is not a C60 molecule it is a actually separate
[01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:28.020]   different fullerenal and it's called a carbon nano onion because you've got
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:32.500]   cages of fullerenes inside cages of fullerenes inside cages of fullerenes
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.900]   so it's like an onion that's why they call it that and so
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:37.300]   that's the thing you know this molecule is just
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.580]   extremely complicated there's hundreds of atoms
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:45.300]   but what's interesting about the carbon nano onion in terms of a fullerene
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:49.380]   for as a health supplement is that it's being led by a very specific science
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:52.740]   team and these are not these are not amateurs these are very professional
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:56.340]   scientists out there looking at how fullerenes can be utilized and this is
[01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:59.860]   what's unique about this is that it's it's the first
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:03.300]   fullerene outside of c70 like c70
[01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:05.940]   there's only one c70 product that i'm even aware of
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:10.980]   is sold by red lion in terms of trying to see how other fullerenes can impact
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:14.100]   people's health and wellness and whether or not the product will take off
[01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:16.980]   it's been three years it's been for sale for three years
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:21.220]   and no one else has done a c70 product and you know so i don't think that one's
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:24.340]   really going to go anywhere in terms of it didn't you know it didn't take off
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:27.780]   as well as c60 did but then when you talk about fullerenals
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.820]   you know there's a very strong um
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:34.660]   in a propensity for it to take off and then when you talk about carbon nano
[01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:38.500]   onions here's again a different fullerene just like c70
[01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:41.620]   that has the potential so now this entire
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:46.660]   product this entire concept stems on this three-part
[01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:49.860]   study that's quoted often in the literature about
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:54.420]   this product and this product that's a carbon nano onion product for health
[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:58.420]   and it's this this study is called well nano carbon i'm sorry well nano carbon
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:02.420]   onion-like fullerenes play a decisive role in the future of molecular
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:05.780]   medicine and so the abstract simply just says mitochondria
[01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:08.660]   are central to the defense by our energetic well since this replication
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:11.540]   and other metabolic activities of the cell
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:16.500]   yes mitochondria uh perturbation triggers a cascade of cellular
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.300]   defenses that affect the entire organism unabated this
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:22.660]   permutation can cause impairment of whole body systems resulting in chronic
[01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:25.780]   data because this is all about um mitochondria but
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:29.220]   the idea though is due to their unique structure of carbon nano onions
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:32.660]   uh and properties fullerenes may have significant benefit
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:36.100]   beneficial effects in humans okay so this was their abstract
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:40.020]   and this was their theory or hypothesis that you know hey this could work and
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:43.620]   then they wrote a three-part study and what's interesting about this three-part
[01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.940]   study and they created a product by the way
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:50.100]   and they tested on rats but they tried it on humans and rats at the same time
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:54.500]   so what makes this really unique guys is that they tested it on humans
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:09:00.740]   and so on part three of this study okay they basically had some volunteers
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:04.100]   and they and it wasn't clinical right it was just volunteers
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:06.820]   and then they studied the reactions of the volunteers
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:10.180]   uh who took uh what this carbon nano on your product
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:13.700]   uh and and which they call graphics okay the product is called graphics
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:17.300]   and so here's a quote right out of here obviously it's if you want to read
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:21.220]   more about it it's on the website and or in my directory the study is
[01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:24.340]   but it basically i want to quote this one section of the of the study where it
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:27.940]   says all subjects reported favorable results associated with
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:32.340]   associated with their use of graphics subjective benefits varied
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:35.380]   with the individual and included feelings of increased energy
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:38.100]   and endurance improve mental clarity and cognition
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:41.300]   and noticeable reduction in previous joint pain and inflammation and overall
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:44.260]   good health now of course this study is about
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:48.660]   graphics uh you know promoted by the company that makes graphics so
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:53.220]   you know uh take it for what you will because this is what they found and of
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:56.820]   course they want to you know you want good results and
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.860]   it sounds great but it's from the person that's selling it
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:03.140]   but here's another thing i want to point out is if you go into the website
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:07.940]   they have a web page dedicated to the results of other research that they did
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:12.740]   and this is what really perked my interest about carbon nano onions
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:15.780]   this is right off the page of the research page
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:19.620]   and they basically tested it on rats so not only did they give some volunteers
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:23.140]   some graphics and they went ahead and tried it and they said hey it's good
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:27.220]   uh but they also had rats and this is this is the only thing about it it
[01:10:27.220 --> 01:10:30.660]   wasn't it was done at the University of New York
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:34.100]   okay and this is and i'm just going to quote this last little
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:38.420]   part of this thing it says the graphics material apparently not only
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.940]   stopped the growth of the prostate cancer on the
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:47.460]   i'm sorry they used mouse mouse mouse but also prolonged its life
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:50.740]   from a normal lifespan of 24 weeks to an
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:56.660]   an extended lifespan or extended life of 96 weeks
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:00.740]   okay five of the other eight mice that was
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:06.100]   uh microwave and graphics treated having the same expected lifespan as those
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:10.260]   mentioned above lived anywhere from 104 weeks
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:15.380]   232 okay now if that doesn't make you go
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:21.460]   whoa really um i mean that was that was my first reaction i was like wow
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:26.100]   really i mean you know and so here's the thing there hasn't been
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:31.700]   independent third-party analysis of graphics slash carbon nano onions
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:36.740]   okay um inter in use uh you know for for biological responses so
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:40.820]   i'm i'm on the fence i think this is amazing i don't doubt its
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:43.860]   authenticity because the scientist behind it
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:47.380]   however i i'm gonna be waiting i'm one of those people i want to wait for the
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:50.260]   second and third study by like say the japanese or
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:53.220]   whomever you know somebody has studied this thing
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.860]   and and before i'll jump in the deep end of this pool
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:59.940]   but i think that work when we talk about where do we go from here
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:04.500]   and you look at the results of this study on this particular fullerene
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:07.220]   you know not only the you know the human study but the but the
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:10.980]   but the mouse study it's pretty amazing and it's kind of a big wow
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:14.420]   and i think that i think that there's something there i think where do we go
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:16.980]   from here are we going to be seeing carbon nano
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:21.380]   onions in the future along with fullerenols i i would guess that we are
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:25.140]   if this is what happened i think we're going to see it and i think it's going
[01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:28.420]   to be an amazing development uh in in the fullerene
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:32.980]   slash c60 industry okay now my last one i want to kind of share with you
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:36.020]   in the area of where do we go from here is that
[01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:42.660]   c60 optics you know it's so hard to wrap my head around this but the c60
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:47.300]   optics is being provided by biaptron and it's called biaptron
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:52.340]   quantum hyperlight with fullerene filters okay now there's a patent on it
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:56.100]   it's an australian patent that they have on this technology
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:13:00.020]   and the claims of the patent is that it's if when you use this
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:03.460]   quantum hyperlight with through a fullerene filter
[01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:07.940]   that it aids in wound healing in pain relief and skin diseases and depression
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:11.700]   and anti-aging okay these are some incredible claims
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.580]   now we all all know it for anybody who studied light
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:20.180]   you know that biafotrons biafotrons are a critical aspect to our health and
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:22.900]   well-being we wouldn't even be alive without them
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:26.420]   light is important for those of you living in the northern hemisphere
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:30.340]   go get a red light please you know and then watch out for blue light all these
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:34.500]   different light spectrums truly affect us we are part and parcel
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:39.620]   beings of light okay as well as beings of energy so light is so critical
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:43.700]   and so these folks are saying that when you take a hyperlight a quantum
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.500]   hyperlight which is one of their medical devices
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:50.420]   and you put it through a fullerene filter you'll have some incredible benefits
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:54.260]   so i think this is one of those fair use claims i just took a snippet
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:56.740]   out of one of their videos and i wanted to share it with you so you have an
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:59.940]   understanding of what they're talking about zepter scientist
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:04.980]   a professor in nanophotonics dr jure karuga has discovered that c60 can
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:10.820]   change the structure of any light biafotron company created the revolutionary
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:14.820]   nanophotonic fullerene optics which acts as a nanophotonic generator to
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:19.060]   transform vertically linearly polarized light and a hyper polarized light
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:23.220]   by uptron quantum hyperlight that can heal humans and all living beings at the
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:27.700]   quantum level how is this possible hyper harmonized
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:31.860]   light possesses the same type of symmetry as 85 of our healthy bio
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:34.980]   structures such ideally permanently structured
[01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:37.860]   hyperlight through resonance imposes its ideal
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:41.380]   structured properties onto the disturbed biomolecules on the quantum
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:45.540]   level bringing them in the same status and the whole body into homeostasis
[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:48.580]   biafotron quantum hyperlight can help you maintain
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:53.060]   regulate and revitalize physiological processes to maintain or attain optimal
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:56.900]   health so there you go i mean that's pretty
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:15:00.020]   amazing when i when i did my alt c60 series
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:05.060]   you know i stopped at frequency i never even thought about c60 as a light form
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:08.420]   and here you go someone's develop it patent it and these are serious
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.780]   scientists in australia developing the product in europe
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:15.860]   so this thing i mean the device itself runs about 1160 euro
[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:18.980]   and the fullerene filters are an extra two or three hundred or
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:24.260]   uh you know euro so you know for about like 13 or vice a 14 1500 euro
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:27.460]   uh that's what this device costs so is it going to be widespread
[01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:33.540]   no uh but our different wellness centers are going to adopt it and
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:38.580]   here is another alternative way to expose yourself to c60
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:41.860]   is through biafotonics and i think that is amazing
[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:44.500]   and this was part of the research that i was doing
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.540]   uh for where do we go from here and i want to leave you with this thought is
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:52.020]   that you know the future of c60 is amazing i mean
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:56.340]   it's just like i said earlier it's like can you imagine back in 1986 when when
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:59.140]   the team at rice university discovered c60
[01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:02.420]   that they had any idea where it was going to go
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:05.220]   you know 30 40 years later i mean people are doing
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:11.700]   c60 topically frequency inhalation and now through biafotonics it's just
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:15.300]   amazing to me and you know i kind of geek out on all this c60 stuff
[01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:18.420]   but i got to tell you between the floor knolls the carbon nano
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:22.500]   onions and this i think our future for the c60 environment and the c60
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:26.820]   community is just gonna be amazing 2021 be pretty cool
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:29.940]   so anyway all of this all the foundations for all of the stuff i just
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:33.860]   mentioned it's all in place the products are out there you can go buy
[01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:37.380]   graphics you can buy full and all you can buy
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:42.020]   this biafotron device it's there it's already there so 2021
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:46.660]   will be an interesting year to watch as these things start to blossom okay
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:50.420]   that's it i you know i went uh one hour 16 i'm sorry this is the longest
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:53.940]   video i ever made but i got really excited and i wanted to share
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:58.500]   all of my research and i think that uh you know it's just like again i see
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:01.780]   60 is just such an amazing molecule and we keep
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:05.940]   finding out what more it can do and it just gets even more amazing so
[01:17:05.940 --> 01:17:09.060]   but thank you so much for for watching thank you for staying
[01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:12.340]   all the way to the end i really appreciate your time
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:15.540]   and you know i really appreciate your interest and and i do
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:19.860]   uh appreciate and i'm very humbled to get by your your kind comments in the
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:24.260]   video section so thank you so much now if you want to learn more about c60
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:28.420]   i do have a blog and i have a huge chunk of my blog is dedicated to c60
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:31.700]   as you can imagine and it's over at the tinker's academy so you just type
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:35.060]   tinker's dot academy and you're you're all your browser window and that'll take
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:39.220]   you right to my website also link below and then of course we have a c60 good
