[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.340]   Aloha, everyone, and welcome to another video by me, Camar, and this video is a C60 question
[00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.960]   and answer.
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.240]   I've had a couple of questions lately about sonication, and Mr. Buxke here just posted
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.780]   this morning on the C60 Good Vibe chat room, and you know, five questions for me, and
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.200]   it's a lot easier to just record the answer than type it all out, and then I realized,
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.040]   you know, I might as well just make this public because you probably, other people probably
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.760]   have the same questions.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.880]   So let me go ahead and just jump right in, and I'm just going to answer the questions
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.880]   in this video.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.820]   So thank you very much, Mr. Buxke, for your compliments.
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.200]   I do appreciate it.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.520]   The first question now is, number one, is the ultrasonic DIY method by using the recommended
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.760]   device, not only the fastest, but also the generally better way to DIY C60 that you could
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.680]   personally recommend ultrasonic better than stirring for 14 days?
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.920]   And the answer is, I can't recommend ultrasonic, or I don't recommend ultrasonic is the best
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.920]   fast way.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.400]   You know, when you look at making C60, there's a fast way, and then there's the benchmark
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.760]   standard Bati way, which is in two weeks, turbo, right?
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.720]   So that's the standard, that's the benchmark stir two weeks, but there are ways to make
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.520]   it faster, and ultrasonic is one way, and the other way, which I've just been tinkering
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.160]   with in the last couple of months, is using heat.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.840]   And so, now that I've kind of done it both ways, meaning the fast way, two ways you can
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.000]   do it faster, I would recommend honestly that it's faster, I mean, sorry, there's faster
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.360]   and slower, right?
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.000]   So let's stay in the fast lane.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.200]   In the fast lane, there are two ways to do it, and I would recommend that the better fast
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.000]   way is using heat, and only for the purpose, because it's just a lot less hassle.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.640]   When you use a sonicator, you've got a lot of things you got to worry about.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.320]   And it's jarring your teeth, the whole time you're standing next to it.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.080]   But that aside, it does get hot, and it can get hotter than you want, so I'm always having
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.160]   to put ice in there, and then the length of time is another issue.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.800]   The size of the machine, I mean, I've got a three liter sonicator, and the biggest
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.560]   flask I can put in there is 500 milliliters, and I make full liters at a time, which means
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.640]   I got to run it twice, so it's a hassle, you know, and you've got to put water in it,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.000]   and you've got to clean it out, and when you're done, and I've discovered that just simply
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.040]   using heat is a lot easier, and it gives you the exact same results.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.520]   You can literally mix your C60 in 24 hours, and let it sit for 10 days, and boom, off
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.520]   you go.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.720]   So it does really cut down that 14 day stir time, cuts it down to one day.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.440]   So when you're in the fast lane, I would recommend heat over ultrasonic.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.200]   So then your other question here is, is the 20 kilohertz operation mode better than 40,
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.680]   and if yes, you know, can you briefly explain why?
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:11.480]   Actually, it is, yes, per Martin at Red Lion, and Martin, I mean, in my research of the different
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.320]   producers of C60, I know of at least, I think the last time was like three, there's a lot
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.480]   of people that make C60, almost everybody stirs, but there's just a handful of folks
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.320]   that use sonicators, and Martin at Red Lion is one of those individuals, and he basically
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.280]   said in all of his experimentations, trials, and errors, that he discovered the lower the
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.680]   frequency of the ultrasonic machine you're using, the better saturation that he was able
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.000]   to obtain through his experimentation.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.920]   So that's why the 20 kilohertz is really, actually it's not 20 kilohertz, is it 20 kilo,
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.640]   I'm sorry, I forget whether it's 20 kilo or 20 hertz, it could be the lower, but the
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.800]   whole idea though is you want to go with the lower number, and then he later after, you
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.320]   know, he constantly is changing his formula, but three years ago, it was, or two years
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.760]   ago, it was 20, and because at the time, the main machine everybody could afford to get
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.800]   where the smaller machines were 20 and 40, most of them are all 40, I mean, literally
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.400]   all of them are 40, but if you go digging around, you can find a 20 and a 40, and so
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.280]   then he said to me, you know, go with the 20, and then after that, about a year later,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.880]   he said, you know what, if you're going to produce commercially, you can get a bigger
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.880]   one and then go with 28, he said 28 was good to go for commercial, but he did mention to
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:43.960]   me that the sweet spot was 21 hertz, okay, so, but there is, I could never find an ultrasonic
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.280]   machine that you could dial in at 21 hertz, so I went with the 2040, and then I did 20
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.400]   hertz for the longest time until I switched to a different way of making C60, and that's
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.040]   the reason why.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:04.440]   Question number two is, do you have any experience about adding a few drops of DMSO to the C60
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.440]   for enhanced results, and if yes, can DMSO be added to all three applications, application
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.720]   options being topic oral and inhaling?
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:23.720]   So my experience with DMSO and C60 has 100% topical, I've never messed with using DMSO
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:31.880]   orally or inhaling, and the thing about DMSO, when I used to have pulverized C60, I used
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.540]   to kind of mess around with it until I realized you don't want to put C60 on your skin and
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:43.160]   then go out in the sun and, you know, so I just really don't use C60 raw on my skin anymore.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.600]   I kind of like evolved into using the C60 topical products.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.640]   In the early days, there just wasn't any C60 topical products, but now I did a video,
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.880]   I don't know, a few months ago, about, you know, like I did a review, and there's a
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.680]   whole bunch of C60 topical products right now, shout out to Layla Labs, and their products
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.680]   are awesome.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:10.240]   Another shout out to C60 Labs, Dave over there produces this coconut C60 thing, it's
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.200]   cream, it's awesome.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.720]   That actually helps, I use that every day from Agzma, and so it really helps, but you
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.080]   know, so at the time there just wasn't, so I would put a drop of pulverized C60 on the
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.640]   back of my hand, and then when it started to just dry just a little bit, you know, the
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.960]   alcohol would evaporate off, I would put a drop of DMSO on top of that, and then it
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.240]   would literally, you know, just carry it straight through into the bloodstream, and it worked
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.240]   really well.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.560]   So, topically, it does work, it does, and it, you know, it'll do that with anything,
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.360]   I mean, it'll just carry it straight through, but, you know, DMSO is a very dangerous thing
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.640]   to play around with, so personally, I would never put it orally, or I would never mess
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:56.360]   with my lungs with that, and it's just, it's a very powerful substance, and so I'm just
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.720]   not going to go there, you know, but that's my experience with it, and I personally would
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.640]   not do oral or inhale.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.520]   Now number three, if you ultrasonic the C60, do you do it for 100 minutes in the dark and
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.520]   in temperature mode?
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:14.000]   Okay, so what I used to use an ultrasonic all the time, I would do 20 hertz, I would
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.880]   only go, and this is the recommendation again by Martin from Red Lion, I would go, I think
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.800]   his recommendation, it's in one of my videos, I think it's in my mixed video, I did a video
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:30.760]   all about mixing, and I did one all about filtration, but in the mixed video, he gave
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:37.360]   me his secret formula, and it was like 2.67 seconds or something like that.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.120]   It was something really, so I'm sorry, but it was a very, very short period of time,
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.840]   it's in that video, I'm sorry, I don't have it around the top of my head, but it's only
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.720]   for a few minutes, it is not 100 minutes, 100 minutes, and this was the thing he said
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.080]   too, when he did all of his experimentation, he said that you can just as easily build
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.560]   up those lipofluorines and creating those liposomes, but then if you go too long with
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.920]   a sonicator, you have two problems, heat, and then the continual vibration will then
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.240]   break up the liposomes, and you go back to C60, and you destroy your fatty acid lipids
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.240]   that it can no longer do liposomes, so he said, you know, he was, I think it was like
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.680]   two minutes something, but I can look it up, you can't find it, let me know, it's in
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:24.200]   that video, where I basically say this is Martin's secret formula, and this is the actual time,
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.040]   he actually gave us a very specific time that says 20 Hertz, these exact number of
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.920]   minutes and seconds, and you're done, don't mess with it anymore, so it's way less than
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.480]   100 minutes, alright, and then the temperature is something that I kind of kind of tinkered
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.920]   with, and I discovered that anything over 105 Fahrenheit, it just, the oil just didn't
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:48.880]   taste that good, you know, you kind of burned it, anything under 105 it would come out okay,
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:55.680]   so I always kept my sonicator, you know, cooler than I always tried to keep it around 90 degrees
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:02.080]   Fahrenheit, now number four question is does it still take one full day to filter the C60
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.640]   with a pump, and how long does it take to just let the C60 run through, it all completely
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:15.000]   depends on what filter you're using, not the filter size, yes you want to use .22 microns,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.840]   that is the standard, and you know, that's the one everybody uses, so you don't go with
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.840]   that, but now the actual filter itself, if it's a four inch filter, it's going to be
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.160]   way different length of time than a two inch filter, right, and depending on the filtration
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:36.000]   device you're using, and so that makes a big difference, and then it depends on the pump,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.680]   so to give you an example if you use, let me just jump into Amazon, pull this up earlier,
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.480]   yeah these guys right here, you see these guys, if you use one of them it's a four inch filter,
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:54.040]   and you attach that to a regular pump like a filter aid or a swift, like these little
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:59.240]   tiny pumps, they look like aquarium pumps, oh I guess I don't sell that one anymore,
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.240]   okay, it's been a while, I got so many of these things, I don't think about it, oh it's
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:11.680]   the pump, pump, okay, how's that, wow, okay I would have to dig around for it, but it's
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.120]   a little tiny pump, and they used to sell one called a filter aid, I don't know why it's
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:25.120]   not here, filter aid, sorry, filter aid vacuum pump, oh here it is, okay so there's the filter
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.720]   aid, this got a little puppy right here, there's another one called a swift, and it's black,
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.800]   and that's the only difference, now you use one of these with one of those plastic filters
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:39.040]   that I showed you earlier, and it will take overnight and you're done, okay, literally
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:45.640]   like not more than 12 hours, to filter it out, okay, and that's on top of the fact that
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.600]   you let it sit for 10 days, if you don't let it sit for 10 days, you're gonna have a hard
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.600]   time filtering, because the filter would get clogged really quickly, but that's how long
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.440]   you have, if you're using just this tiny little pump and a plastic filter, now if you're
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.040]   using a glass filter with a two inch piece of filter paper in it, you know, a two inch
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.680]   nozzle, then you're gonna want to use one of these bigger pumps like this one, I have
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.040]   one of these, I have a Causey Vacu 3.5, almost like, almost exactly one this one, and I have
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.240]   one of these guys, and this puppy, oh here's a swift right there, this black everything,
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:23.960]   but then I have one of these blue ones, it's a Causey Vac 3.5 cubic feet per minute, you
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:30.480]   know, vacuum pump, and when I attach that to a glass, you never attach it to a plastic
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.880]   one, it'll break it, but if you attach it to glass with the right tubing, and you put
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:41.640]   in, you could run a, you can run a thousand milliliters in less than 40 minutes, I mean
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.560]   that thing will just suck it right through, you'll have to replace the paper three times,
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:51.440]   but very quick, very quick, so that answers that question there, last thing was, okay,
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:58.240]   and then one more question was, do you recommend using C60 Frequency in the power capsule,
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:03.960]   the 90/10 power capsule, or even having it permanently in the 90/10 cube, like a healing
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:10.520]   stone, oh yeah, honestly I think that's good stuff, I mean I have, you know, I have multiple
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:16.800]   cubes in my home, and so it's kind of like, it's a broadcast station, basically it's got
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.520]   this giant toro field of energy around it, and whatever you put inside that thing is
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.360]   going to broadcast it within the field, so if I'm living, you know, if I live in the
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:29.400]   field, then yeah, why not, I mean, so I would definitely say put all sorts of wonderful
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.360]   things that are good for you in that, just remember though that you're living with it
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:38.800]   and you're constantly exposed to it, and something that you always want to be really careful
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.520]   about is like, you know, too much is not good sometimes, so, you know, so pick and choose
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:49.440]   what you want, like for me, I don't really have supplements in mind in terms of inside
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:55.160]   a cube, instead I have the frequency of silver, that's what I'm doing this month, and I really
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.760]   like it, it's really helping with my sleep, so that's that, okay so other than that, now
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.760]   the other thing I do want to ask you, or I want, I'd like to see if you can consider
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.880]   this, is you're saying that you want to make C60 for your family, and so you're obviously
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.640]   opting to go the faster route, I just want to point out that, here's the thing about
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:21.440]   using a sonicator, they're like 150 bucks, right, or if you're using like heat, this
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.840]   is the one, you know, Santa was good to me last Christmas, and Santa, and I got this one,
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:34.120]   and so it was $250, and this is what I use for, you know, using heat to stir C60, or
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:40.960]   to mix it overnight, and it works, like I said, so you know, it is pricey, and I want to point
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.280]   out that, you know, if you time your production correctly, and you're always, and you could
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:52.040]   make big batches, so if you get one of these, and this is like the consensus of the group,
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.680]   is that this is like literally the best one, and C60 Labs Dave over there recommended this
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.920]   one, and people who bought it are like yeah, absolutely this thing works great, if you get
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:06.360]   a maelstrom, it's only 140, it goes on sale around Black Friday, drops down to like 99
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.680]   bucks every year, does that, right, so if you just wait till November, which is like
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.840]   what, six weeks away, and then you could probably just pick this puppy up for like 100 bucks,
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.960]   and this guy can stir up to two liters easy, so if you're making C60 for your family and
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:26.000]   you want to do it in bulk, you can do two liters at a time on a maelstrom, way cheaper, it's
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.320]   not the flash, you know, it's a slow lane, right, it's a two week slow lane, but it's
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.560]   a lot less expensive, you can do bigger batches, and if you just time everything right, and
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.680]   depending on the consumption level of your family, and how fast you're making C60, you
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.160]   know, this might work out for you, and one of the things about the maelstrom, and this
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.160]   is what Dave was saying at C60 was, he's got 50 of these things, he's been running them
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:55.200]   24/7 for over two years, and has never had one break, so I mean, we're talking about
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:01.920]   a really good stir at a decent price with the Black Friday, and you can just be doing
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.840]   two liters at a time, and two liters, this goes a long way, you know, depending on how
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.720]   many people you're doing, so you don't necessarily need to be in the fast lane, you can easily
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:17.280]   be in the slow lane, and just get a really good stir that can do more than one liter
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:24.000]   at a time, and that, and this is as a reminder, you always want to use these straight walled
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.960]   beakers, they produce the best vortex, keep it covered, keep it dark to your other question,
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.760]   and then you want to use your stir bars, now when you're looking at stir bars, because
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.920]   the maelstrom, I don't believe, comes with one, I know that the 4E doesn't come with
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:43.000]   one, so when you're looking at stir bars, just as an FYI, I've tried all these different
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.040]   stir bars, I went and bought like the every single size, and shape, and you know what,
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.080]   honestly, nothing works better than just a regular old, you know, stir bar with no little
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:59.720]   nub on it, and just get a two inch one, and it works perfectly with a one liter straight
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:05.120]   walled beaker, and you're good to go, all right, that's it, thanks for your questions,
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.160]   and I hope this helped other people, and aloha, have a great day guys, bye.
