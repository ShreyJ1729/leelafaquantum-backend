[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kailner and in this
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.400]   video let's talk about biohacking and is biohacking for rich people because it certainly seems that
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.240]   way and I just wanted to just talk about this topic because it kind of came up this year after
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.920]   the most recent biohacking conference where some of the attendees or at least one of video, another
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.800]   video I did see from two different individuals were sort of just commenting on the concept that
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.880]   you know it's like twenty five hundred dollars just to attend you know and you listen to some
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.520]   great speakers and you get introduced to some great new devices and modalities and treatments
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.640]   that are out there for all you know for the entire purpose of biohacking but the idea was was that
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.120]   you know geez you know there's so many different devices and they're not that cheap and so the
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.160]   idea that you know the concept that kind of came out and I didn't attend by the way but the concept
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.760]   that came out was you know hey is biohacking just for rich people because it seems like everything
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.320]   you see is all product related you know in terms of just people trying to say hey biohacking or
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.440]   really expect expensive supplements and things like that so I thought I'd make just a quick video
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.680]   just to share my thoughts on the subject is biohacking for rich people so the very first thing I think
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.800]   it's really important is to understand the difference between just you know taking care of your health
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.640]   and the concept of biohacking so what is biohacking by definition it's the practice of using methods
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.080]   for bio you know from biology genetics neural science and nutrition to improve your health and
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:41.520]   well-being okay so that means improving it beyond just optimal normal being healthy okay so if you
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.360]   want to kick it up a notch that's called biohacking you want to do more than just be healthy you want
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.640]   to just like really you know increase you'll this pretty much falls in the world of athletics right
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.360]   you want to increase your performance you want to be sharper at work you know you want to be
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.320]   able to have more stamina for the kids that sort of thing and so the all you know the other idea
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.680]   too is it also can be used to enhance right which is what I'm going getting to with enhancing your
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.120]   physical or mental performance or achieve a specific health outcome you know like run faster swim
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.600]   faster all that kind of stuff so really the idea here in my definition is that there is a definite
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.280]   you know definitive difference between just maintaining your health and then biohacking and in my
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.120]   personal opinion you know health right now is when you're at optimal health and you're already
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.760]   operating at peak performance naturally and that keyword is naturally and this means you've addressed
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.400]   your issues with vitamin and mineral deficiencies everyone is deficient in something have you been
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.920]   evaluated have you taken care of you're just your basic health which is you know you're not
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.840]   deficient in anything making sure that you you are addressing those issues making sure that you're
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.360]   looking at your toxic load you know because we're all being poisoned all the time every time we breathe
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.760]   every time you know all this stuff that's in the food water air you name it are you detoxing do you
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.800]   have a detox regimen that you're following every day in making sure that you're kind of making
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.000]   sure you're keeping your toxicity levels down and if you've bio accumulated it for a long time
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.760]   before you got interested in your health you know you're you're behind the you know you're behind
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.480]   eight ball on that you've got to catch up and then maintain right and also those you know there's
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.680]   another thing people have is we all have a pathogen load and a pathogens or you know viruses and
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.240]   bacteriums molds and fungi that live in and on our bodies and have you addressed that because all
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.720]   of those things are detrimental to our health and then the most important thing in my personal
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.840]   opinion is your gut microbiome because it really is the you know the basis for our immune system
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.360]   and our immune response is how healthy is your digestive system I mean we literally should all
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.520]   be like our dogs where we like basically poop twice a day if you aren't processing and you've got
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.400]   a really strong digestive process and your system's really healthy then you know that's
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.440]   something that's really really critical to look at in terms of you're maintaining a healthy gut
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.360]   microbiome and of course your physical strength you know your your our muscles are are basically
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.800]   our base our electrical battery packs that run our electric body bottom line they generate the
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.480]   electricity that runs through our bodies that keeps our bodies moving because we are bio electric
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.120]   beings okay so having muscle strength now you don't need to be you know muscle building
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.840]   but just being able to have that strength as you get older muscle strength is real
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.160]   important and of course dealing with your trauma because trauma manifests itself as physical
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.200]   conditions and dealing with that also is your you know affects your mental health your emotional
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.600]   health and so forth so for me I think that you know one of the things before people jump into
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.600]   biohacking is to really take a hard look at their overall health take a look at these five things
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.800]   about yourself and you know are you doing the most you can do for just that that to me is par
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.440]   for the course until you can get to a baseline you know then you know honestly you know trying
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.360]   to get better at your brain working when you have digestive problems and you're vitamin something
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.240]   deficient you know it's kind of like well you know you're kind of approaching it out of sequence
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.320]   because you really want to make sure that your health is optimal and then of course
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.320]   of course you don't have to but that's just my opinion but I really think that there's a huge
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.280]   difference between maintaining your health and then biohacking and which is kicking it up a notch
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.280]   and taking it one step further so the reason I kind of made this video is not only where the
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.840]   comments that came from the biohacking conference this year but also too this kind of this guy
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.760]   this guy's name is Brian Johnson I don't know if you saw this in the news he's been in so many
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.560]   different magazines and and news sites and it really kind of popped up this year he basically is
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:57.520]   this tech CEO executive who spends two million dollars a year on biohacking you know basically
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.200]   his story is he kind of abused the crap out of himself and his youth like the rest of us right
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:08.240]   and he's playing ketchup right now trying to basically reverse all of that and then you know
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.800]   kind of you know seeking the fountain of youth through tons of different things so the guy takes
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.840]   like you know 61 pills a day eat 70 pounds of veggies a month and he's you know he's doing some
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:24.000]   really wacky things but he's just basically the guy's got money and he's doing sick you know heavy
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.840]   duty biohacking to kind of turn his biological age and turn the clock backwards and this guy
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.720]   really made the news because of just how much he's spending and the overall goal for biohacking
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.760]   basics you know bottom line is this guy's really focused on anti-aging physical and mental
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.040]   performance and he's spending a lot of money to do it and so then again that you know raises the
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.880]   question hey you know what you know if you want to go to the conference and it costs you $2,500
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.400]   just to get in the door you know this guy two million a year you know it's like wow is really
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.680]   is biohacking really for rich people or can anybody just do it you know and you know and bottom line
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:08.560]   is anybody can just do it so here's kind of just you know my thoughts on just the basics okay now
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.840]   right off the bat supplementation is critical right just supplementation just for your optimal health
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.960]   just for regular health and how I do it and this is a kind of a graph of how I break out my expenses
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.640]   every month and yeah I'm sort of a nerd when it comes to this I track everything I budget and you
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:31.520]   know I do all this stuff spreadsheets are are my thing so one of the things about the supplements
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.160]   I take is I kind of break it up into tears because it really gets expensive and that goes along with
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.320]   you know rich people right I mean how much can you afford because there are some incredible
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.040]   supplements out there and there's new ones being developed and released every single day and they're
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.800]   not cheap some of them are very very expensive so one of the approaches that I take is I look at
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.960]   it like hey my health just run of the mill optimal performance of my meat sack you know just running
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.640]   every day and so I spend about 200 a month just on plain old health supplements and the health
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:08.880]   supplements I mean are the new essential nutrients the vitamins the minerals right the probiotics
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.440]   the prebiotics and things that are just going to keep all of that stuff I mentioned earlier
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.080]   optimal performance so you can kind of see where I focus on my general health
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:24.160]   cardiovascular stuff I have I have a kidney issue that you know just kidney stone I've had a few
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.600]   times so I take some kidney stuff that's specific to that of course I'm getting older so I look at
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.280]   my joints I make sure I'm addressing my immune system I'm taking detox type of supplements
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:41.600]   I do take a few brain supplements you know in that tier one health and then of course focusing
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:47.600]   on my gut 15% of my costs every month I'm spending on gut health and but here it is too though I
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:55.520]   also do this tier two where I actually will spend up to 200 a month just on anti-aging because if
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:01.600]   you can work on that anti-aging stuff then it it slows the degradation of your physical body
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.760]   right so then you have less health problems so that's my theory right so right now I'm right
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:13.280]   now I'm basically in my world right now I've got I do tier one and tier two this is the breakdown
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:18.320]   of it so just to kind of show you how much money I put towards different things every month and
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.360]   just my basic philosophy and then I get into tier three where I really get into my brain
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.480]   and my balls and just trying to keep those help you know basically boosting testosterone
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.000]   and boosting and boosting mental performance is another 70 dollars a month so you can see where
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.360]   just tier one and two is 400 a month and then if I throw in my brains and my balls
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:45.360]   it's 470 and I never even get to tier four which is this giant list of wish list stuff that I always
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.320]   want to try or I have to rotate in and out but I just can't afford it you know and so a lot of
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.800]   people and I can't even imagine the average Joe today you know when you look at some of the
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:00.080]   financial news out there and realize that you know the boomer generations the biggest generation
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:06.800]   ever that our you know our country has ever seen and that literally half of them if you look at
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.840]   some of the news half of them don't even have a thousand dollars saved up for retirement I mean
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.920]   and then of course you've got all the millennials struggling with inflation and Gen X's and Gen Z's
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.320]   and and so you know inflation's a big deal so money's really tight a lot of people living paycheck to
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.800]   paycheck and how do you maintain your health when you're not quote rich people and so the idea here
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.320]   though and what I'm trying to say is if money's really tight you know biohacking can be done
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.160]   there's a lot of really good ways to do biohacking I'll cover that at the end but at the end of the
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.600]   day you know the question here is is it for rich people and yeah you know it kind of is because of
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.720]   the cost of some of this stuff these are just things that you need because you're not ever gonna get
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:52.640]   all the minerals and vitamins you need from the food you eat it's just not possible and the reason
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.440]   for that is because the food's been depleted in nutrients so here we go so now the other thing
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.600]   too is not only just supplements but we're looking at devices so you know I took a look at the
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:06.000]   sponsorship of the conference and some of these you know some of these vendors popped out as they
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.120]   were sponsoring the conference you also if you follow biohacking news which I do I'm really I've
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.720]   been a biohacker for 20 years been really super into my health for 20 years and and honestly if
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.200]   you saw me and you'd be like you'd be a gasket like you're you know you're a health nut and I'm
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:28.400]   like yeah I'm you know I'm overweight and I got gray hair and you know but I'm super healthy for
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:34.000]   my for my height but bottom line though is that there's a combination here of supplementation which
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I think is critical to our health but also too you know there's all these devices that are being
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.200]   promoted out there in the quote biohacking space but here's the key though is it for rich people
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.280]   and the answer is kind of like yeah because you look at some of the stuff like hyperbinder by the
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.000]   way all this stuff is excellent I mean it really is it does what it says it's going to do science
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.680]   is behind it that's why there's all these products are out there and nothing wrong with all those
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.520]   guys selling these products and promoting these products you know good for you everyone you know
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.440]   wants to make a living and they want to help the world but I got to tell you though from the you
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.560]   know from the standpoint of me right now in my financial situation I'm with the rest of you I'm
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.840]   fighting inflation I'm trying to save money I'm trying to really make my dollar last as far as I
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:20.240]   can make it last now and so I'm kind of like past that point in my life where I'm buying expensive
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:25.760]   doodads and gizmos and I'm more focusing on what I could do naturally you know just without having
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.160]   to have all this equipment but I'll tell you when you look at some of those things that were being
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.160]   promoted at the conference and things that are promoted in the biohacking sphere you know you're
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.800]   like and they're awesome and man I would love to try this stuff but you can't even there's no way
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.440]   in hell and I'm going to spend five thousand dollars on a cold plunge tub and you know and
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.600]   there's a huge difference a lot of people go out and get a freezer you know or just get a you know
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.600]   get a metallic tub and then use ice use big chest freezers and things like that you can get it for
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:57.200]   you know you get those things from under 500 and so yeah there's a way to do it but if you just
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.400]   wanted to go out and buy one and there's a big difference and I don't want to get into the
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.560]   difference here's in the key but the key is this if you buy one that's like you know off the shelf
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.560]   really good one then the thing's not only going to you know keep it as cold as you want all the
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.200]   time it's going to keep the water clean you don't have to use ice that's why it's expensive it's
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.760]   really built well it's going to last a long time that's why these dollar prices are so high and
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.400]   so you've got you know things like the biosynchronizer you know by VEMI and you look at this and go wow
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.120]   what does this thing do well it's a combination of PMF acoustics and infrared and you sit on this
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.000]   thing for 10 minutes and it just boosts your cellular performance or a sauna dome you know heat
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.400]   as well as cold are really really super healthy for us you know in terms of just
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.560]   you know like a sauna right just or a sauna room but you know you can get a dome but it's
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:46.560]   2,900 bucks now I've got asterisks here next to the hyperbaric oxygen in the biosynchronizer because
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:52.960]   you know you go to your website they don't even give you a price you have to ask for a quote and
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:59.440]   you know anytime you have to ask for a quote you know it's so damn expensive that they don't even
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.240]   want to tell you what it is on the website because it's going to be turn off they want you to talk
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.840]   to a sales guy who can then try to convince you that the dollars are worth it you know and so
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.760]   you know when they ask for a quote it's like a real big like red flag to me I'm like oh crap that
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.920]   thing must be so expensive you know that they know they don't even want to put the number down and
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.520]   so then there's other devices out there too I mean you look at the biocharger which is one of these
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:27.200]   remarkable devices and which is kind of a lacovsky multi-wave oscillator but these things are 15,
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:35.120]   16,000 dollars to have one and what they work on is they work on your energetic bio field and
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:41.280]   they basically entrain the you know the frequencies of you know all of these different types of you
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.440]   know what's bottom line multi-wave oscillator I can't get into the science of it but bottom line
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:51.760]   it's frequency medicine and it entrains your body to for maximum cellular performance throughout
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:57.120]   your entire being and you know you are you are a quantum being like quantum biology and so we all
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:02.640]   resonated frequencies blah blah blah but these things are designed to bring you up to optimal
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:07.840]   frequency and then you know like the biocharger is like got all these programs you can run in it
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:13.920]   my multi-wave oscillator this thing was invented like geez 100 years ago almost and this thing is
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.400]   almost you know it's actually been attributed to cure the big C so you know these are some
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.280]   incredible devices out there but look how expensive they are and then you look at like a device like
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:30.160]   the nano V which they won't even give you the price on the website this thing is a proton folding
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:36.000]   device it you know it's a protein folding and that's what it's you know basis for you've got the V
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.320]   light which is like cranial electro stimulation to stimulate your brain and increase your brain
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.040]   performance and also through cold laser therapy and things like that and so you've got these
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:52.240]   really incredible gizmos but if you look at the prices of some of these they're just
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.720]   unbelievable and again you know you get into the lower range stuff like the red light
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.520]   you know you can do red light therapy and I know I put out some of the expensive ones but you know
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:07.680]   like just to get a couple of panels three grand you know PMF as you've ever looked into PMF the
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.880]   mats and the coils and all of those things they range anywhere from you know three five thousand
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.680]   all the way up to like something like this it's like thirteen thousand dollars for coils
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:23.280]   the big the ones that sit on the countertops are like anywhere up to twenty grand you can get
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:28.080]   hydrogen inhalers you can get little cheapy ones that are like really low producing ones that
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.080]   they're not too bad they're three hundred six hundred but then if you really want to get one
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.040]   that's robust and I'm going to give you a really big dose of molecular hydrogen you know like
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.440]   twenty five thousand or twenty five hundred and then if you look at ryfing technology that's
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:48.240]   another frequency type of healing modality and also wellness you know like this example right
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:52.800]   here's the g before thousand and this puppy runs forty five hundred so you know they're not cheap
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.120]   and so when you say hey you know all this stuff you know that and you know like these are all
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:03.120]   really great toys to really improve your health and maintain your wellness and kick you up that
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:09.040]   notch you know but you're looking at hundreds if not thousands of dollars in gizmos and then you
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.680]   look at what Brian Johnson's doing this guy over here I mentioned right you know he's actually
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.720]   getting into if you read the articles about him he does hormone therapies and stem cell therapies
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.080]   and you know we're talking about going to the doctor and doing all this stuff and you know
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.520]   going to the doctors never going to be cheap and it's certainly probably not covered under
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:31.280]   insurance so out of pocket you know this guy's got bucks like most of us don't but you know you
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.400]   there's some credible biohacking treatments you can get from all these different doctors out there
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:41.440]   you know they're selling their wares to you know to do stem cell therapies which
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:48.080]   which by the way is just incredible from you know injury healing kind of thing
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.120]   as well as general health and anti-aging because as you get older you don't produce as many stem
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.360]   cells blah blah blah hormone therapy same thing as you get older your hormones you know you just
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.920]   need some hormonal and then like one of the things that Brian Johnson's doing which I think is really
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:07.040]   creepy you know he has a teenage son and he and he has he does blood therapy where they you know
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:13.040]   they've proven that if you take blood out of young people right and put it into old people
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:18.640]   it helps the old people it actually really really improves the older people's health by getting
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.600]   younger blood because of all the antibodies and all the stuff that's in young people's blood
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.640]   that our bodies older people don't produce and so you know I just think that's weird I would never
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:35.200]   ask my daughter to hit her up from some blood but bottom line though my point is this and the
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:40.080]   question is this biohacking for rich people when you look at the cost of supplements you look at
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:45.280]   the cost of the gizmos and the doodads and the doohikis and all this stuff that's just like you know
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:51.680]   is out there in the biohacking sphere saying hey this is the stuff you should get you should try
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.160]   and the answer is like do you really need all that or can I even afford all that I just want to
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.160]   be healthy but I also want to really you know as I get older you know I need to keep my brain
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.960]   sharp I need to keep my body moving and I need to keep healthy and I just want to you know work
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:10.400]   on all of these things and so is biohacking for me do is it for rich people and you know what
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:16.480]   here's the answer no it's not for rich people it's for anyone that wants to do it and if you can't
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.840]   afford a gizmo or a device and you know and yeah they all work in everything but you know it's just
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:27.040]   not practical for all of us to be able to afford all this stuff I personally was fortunate to have
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:32.320]   a very good job in my career I've since retired but when I was cranking and making the bucks you
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:37.280]   know I didn't have any problems buying some of these toys I still have them thankfully but now that
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.760]   I'm you know past that point where I'm living off of my own money you know you know the income is
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.320]   not you know there's not a lot of income coming in and so I really need to be watching where I
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.280]   spend my money and so I'm really been focused lately on thinking that in terms of you know hey
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:57.120]   how do I maintain my health and my wellness and how do I keep biohacking when money's getting tighter
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:03.840]   and tighter as you know as I go into retirement so one of the things I want to point out is hey
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:10.400]   you know what you can biohack naturally for free biohacking is not just for rich people sure the
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:15.120]   rich people will go out there and buy all this crap and yeah it'll it basics it's like a shortcut
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:21.600]   really it's like a shortcut to performance but you and me now you know normal people you know we can
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:29.520]   biohack for free naturally and it's so so common sense and I just wanted to remind everybody that
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.720]   no it's not just for rich people it's for everybody and it's even for people who have no money because
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:40.080]   it's for free what can you do for free that would really really move the dial if you just spend some
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:46.560]   time on it so if you have time make time but making sure you get sunlight every day how
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:51.200]   incredibly important you know that goes into the whole photo bio modulation stuff it's good for
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:56.480]   your brain it's good for your skin it's good for your health the vitamin D also grounding
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:02.160]   grounding has been shown that's also called earthing and it grounding just putting your feet on grass
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.800]   20 minutes will lower your blood pressure like 20 points or something like that maybe if you
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:12.720]   read the science but just basically do you know basically grounding out all that built-up electrical
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.960]   charge that's you carry around with you all day because you're around electronics constantly right
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:22.720]   but how incredibly healthy is it just to ground it what does it cost you to just step out on your
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:28.080]   backyard and put your feet on the grass for a few minutes and by the way it's literally instantaneously
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:34.560]   it isn't they've measured it and it's it's so fast that it's it's like it's microseconds by that
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:39.360]   you put your feet on the ground your bare feet on the ground and boom you've immediately discharged
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.120]   now the longer you do it the better you're going to get the effective grounding
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:49.600]   but just grounding hey it's free fasting a huge thing with biohacking is intermittent fasting and
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:56.160]   fasting in general up to three days 72 hours but just what our bodies do as we fast it kicks off
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.800]   this thing called autophagy it really helps us with our analytics you know in terms of getting
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:07.360]   rid of sinesis cells blah blah blah it is huge important thing if you can fast and in fact there's
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.480]   so many studies out there right now that that have demonstrated that calorie calorie restriction
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:18.720]   equals longevity it just flat out equals longevity you know the whole three meals a day thing is all
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.360]   BS you don't need that one meal a day there's the you know the one meal a day people there's the
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:29.120]   intermittent fasting people then there's the fasting people but bottom line is if you prolong the
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.680]   time between meals the healthier you are and if you could do intermittent fasting like
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.560]   oh go over 12 hours you will kick off some body processes that you normally don't have that are
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:44.240]   really super good for anti-aging and performance improvements okay and then again you know when
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:51.040]   it comes to our brains meditation whoa they have found the science has found so many benefits
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:56.080]   of just mental and emotional health from just doing 15 minutes a day minimum you know just
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.720]   or any chance you get just even in your car you know before you go in and out of your
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.600]   house or office just doing some little quick meditation sent to yourself it's just incredibly
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:10.480]   healthy for you of course exercise and everybody tells you to exercise yeah that's a no-brainer
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:16.400]   go for a walk you know walk your dog not not a problem yoga now comes to the point of stretching
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:21.760]   again you're working those muscles in a different way than just exercising and doing yoga has been
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.720]   proven to be incredibly great for anti-aging and overall just mood you know just your mood
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:32.320]   and then cold now it's winter time right if you thought about just sitting outside in the cold
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.120]   and letting your body your skin temperature drop to a really low level like around you know i think
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:44.560]   if you it's the science is called cold thermogenesis and what the whole idea was is that our bodies are
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:51.040]   just burned tons of calories to just stay warm but also it kicks off epigenetic processes
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:56.240]   when your body gets cold and so the idea though is to you know you can either immerse your face in
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:02.880]   a bowl of ice water or i like what i do is i just go sit outside you know and yeah i'm having a cigar
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:08.480]   while i'm doing it but i'm doing cold thermogenesis bioacting that's how i that's how i mentally
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.920]   process that and but at the at the end of the day i get out there and i let myself get really really
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:18.800]   cold and then of course i come back inside and warm up but i do that every day during winter
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:24.480]   and that cold therapy is so good i mean i don't know if you knew this but people in scandinavia
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.920]   they put their babies outside for their naps during the day outside where it's like zero or minus
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:36.400]   something right and it's in an immune system and the health of babies in scandinavia from doing that
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.560]   it boosts their immune system so much that they don't have half the problems that we do
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:46.240]   here uh you know in our country right and then of course sleep there's you can't say enough about
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.680]   sleep but sleep is actually really tied to uh your your emotional state and you're because if you
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.920]   don't get enough sleep you don't get enough uh you know rem you don't get enough deep sleep
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:00.480]   blah blah blah there's this whole science behind sleep but you need to get good sleep so making
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:06.800]   sure you you book you know book time of your day to sleep and especially take a nap a little 20
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:12.560]   minute power nap huge improvement for your health and then lastly relationships relationships
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.520]   there you know it's like why do married men live longer than single men right and you
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:23.120]   you've heard that study before but the bottom line a really healthy pair bonded uh couple
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.240]   who have just you know who who just basically support each other emotionally etc uh you know
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.440]   those people live longer they just do and it's just the science uh it's just that and the relationships
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.680]   with your pet you know if you've all heard the same stories about pets that's why they bring
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:43.920]   dogs and cats into hospices and nursing homes because it's so beneficial for the
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:49.360]   health uh and not just physical I mean not just mental and emotional but also physical health
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:54.560]   of the patients and just like there's something about a cat's per has a frequency that's really
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.440]   beneficial to our overall uh you know wellness and happiness the same thing with you know holding
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:04.800]   your dog and just interacting with your dog and bonding with your dog but just relationships keep
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:10.320]   us living longer and healthier and it's just amazing but that's what the science says and guess what
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.520]   all of that stuff's for free so it's biohacking for rich people absolutely not you can do this whole
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:20.720]   list for free and that's the point of my video today is that you know biohacking has kind of gone
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:26.160]   off on a tangent where it's all about gizmos right I've been biohacking for 20 years I mean I've
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:32.240]   been doing all this weird stuff I've got I've got I've have this device I've got uh this device I've
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:37.040]   got this I've got this I've got this right so I'm one of those people right that buys a lot of gizmos
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:42.880]   because I'm like a gearhead but at the end of the day um you know it's not about gizmos it's not
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:48.000]   about devices it's about how you live your life and so if you could just kind of squeeze in some of
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.800]   these things if not all of these things you know it's so much better uh to do it naturally A that's
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:00.560]   where I always default to and at the same time it's free it's free guys so no it's not for rich
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.720]   people you can do it and you don't have to spend any money I personally just you know at this I'm
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.600]   at this stage of life where I don't buy them anymore gizmos I'm focused on how to do the most I can
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:14.320]   naturally and of course I just want to leave off a couple of little things here that you know to
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.080]   live naturally and you want to bio act or free you know there's some other things too that you
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:23.120]   need to avoid doing and one of the things you really need to avoid is blue light we've heard all the
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.680]   stories about how blue light you know being in front of screens and everything's really bad for
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:33.600]   our brains it is bad for your brain you know so avoid sorry avoid blue light at night avoid energy
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.880]   vampires you know this is true people do suck the energy out of you you know who they are you're
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:45.520]   most likely related to them by marriage so energy vampires will sap the living crap life out of you
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.840]   don't don't let them just you know and so uh you know bottom line at the end of the day avoid them
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:56.400]   and avoid alipas there's this really funny story you can google it uh where there was a uh hospital
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:02.080]   strike in california a few years back and they actually measured the death rate of people
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:09.760]   enduring and after the strike and they discovered that while the hospitals were on strike the death
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:15.440]   rate in that county or whatever it was in california somewhere decreased by like 20 percent just think
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:21.200]   less people died you know when the alipas you know the doctors and the hospitals were closed
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.040]   right it's try to think about what that means and of course if you look at the death rate
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.800]   you know what's the percentage of of people who die and what are the causes you know basically
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:38.240]   malpractice is like up in the top five so personally i avoid them i avoid the doctors they're gonna end
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:44.080]   up you live longer and that's actually true you know so that's a free thing there but you need to
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:49.520]   avoid some stuff uh as part of your biohacking health journey as much as you should try to do
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.920]   some of these things and of course the gizmos are fun there's cheaper ways to do it and if you want
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.560]   to learn about some of those cheaper ways to do some of that's fancy stuff you know we i have a
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:03.280]   health and healing telegram group uh that we talk about this stuff all the time and we're always
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:10.560]   you know but you know diy cold plunges diy rifing and all that stuff and pmf and so there's all these
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.800]   really great modalities that you could do that you're not going to break the bank uh and so that's
