[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video and in this one I'd
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.640]   like to share with you the six experiments. You know the drill before we
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.680]   do that. Some disclaimers. This material is for research purposes only. C-60 oil
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.600]   is not approved for consumption by the FDA. This is not medical or health advice.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.840]   This is not a product endorsement. I do not sell C-60 products and I don't get
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.220]   paid in any way to do videos. One particular thing about this video is I
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.120]   highly recommend you watch the other video I made called making C-60 oil with
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.740]   pulverized C-60 to get a little bit of a background in what I'll be talking
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.680]   about. Otherwise you might be a little lost so if you want to just go ahead and
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.140]   pause this go watch that and come right back I'll be waiting for you. Meanwhile
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.400]   the rest of us let's jump in. So the six experiments. What I've done is I just
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.800]   had some questions about you know using pulverized C-60 with different oils and
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.520]   what would happen and how to do it right and you know tinker tinker tinker
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.360]   which is pretty much my life and then so I kind of did some of that so I using
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.480]   pulverized C-60 I kind of went ahead and did some avocado and sunflower oil
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.840]   experiments and I followed it following the directions and of course not following
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.880]   the directions. I used the word adapting it's a guy frame of reference for not
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.680]   following directions I adapted and so you know and I want to show you share
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.160]   what happened with all of that because the results are interesting. Also I was
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.480]   tinkering around with some different kind of C-60s so number five I used a
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.560]   99.99% sublimed C-60 this is not a regular C-60 that you would buy like
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.160]   from SES but this is like it's just it's just basically synthesized in a
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.320]   different way I'll get into that and then also I used a product on the market
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.840]   that is advertised as having a huge amount of C-60 molecules monomolecular
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.760]   floating around and it you know and because it has so much packed into a
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.840]   little bottle I did an experiment with that to see if I could use it like a
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.840]   mother for you know if you ever did sourdough bread there's like this mother you
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.440]   know and you can keep taking off pieces and make more so I kind of was thinking
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.400]   you know hey what what you know why don't I see if I could do that with that
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.160]   so I've done some of these experiments and I just wanted to share with you because
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.680]   that's what I do so let's jump right into number one pulver IC-60 in avocado
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.280]   oil and you know what this is perfection I am really happy how it turned out it
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.800]   does it this it couldn't get any better than this color right here this is like
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.960]   literally the color of the best C-60 oil you could make and so I was really
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.000]   happy and how I got there was instead of just filtering after okay you know
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.920]   that you know the drill with pulver IC-60 right you just stir for a week then
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.760]   you've let it sit for 10 days you filter with a 25 micron filter you let it
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.000]   sit for another 10 days you filter with a 10 which I couldn't find so I used a
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.120]   10.5 micron filter which is two times right filtering twice and then that was
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.040]   the directions however by following the directions what happened was as it
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.960]   looks like this and it came out really cloudy now this is experiment number two
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.080]   with avocado oil and experiment number four with sunflower oil so with both
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.360]   batches using pulver IC-60 after the second filtering it came out kind of
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.840]   cloudy and it just you know it just didn't look right to me and I want it
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.560]   it needs to look like this this is perfection and so what I decided to do
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.960]   was well let's just run this guy through another filter a third time and that's
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.360]   what I did and this time though I used a much much much smaller filter a 0.22
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.800]   micron filter and and this is what was extracted from the solution after two so
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.200]   this is what I found out and I also by playing around with my sonicator I've
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.120]   discovered that 45 minutes is pretty much the best time on that so 45 minutes
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.920]   keeping it around 102 degrees 105 we're on there and filtering it a third time
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.800]   and you will come out with this gorgeous purple C60 oil full of lipo
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.040]   fullerenes and it's literally you know it's literally a commercial great
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.800]   product so I highly recommend that if all you guys do in pulverized go ahead
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.520]   and get a third set of filters and go and filter this the solution and and
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.440]   you'll get a really really good product so let's talk about filtering though
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.240]   because this is what I kind of went through which was you know I got that
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.240]   rig after a failed attempt with Amazon sent me this weird thing and it was like
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.320]   3599 okay so really cheap one-time purchase that's it and then I bought
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.160]   some paper filters you have to buy a 25 micron filter you have to buy a 10
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.920]   micron filter and so and then but the point two two ones are a little bit
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.040]   more expensive they don't come like the other two come at 100 a pack the point
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.560]   two two ones come at 50 a pack for like 18 something and so they come out like
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.600]   37 cents each but I was my failed attempt was I use one of these throw away guys
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:27.080]   which was $6.93 each and the problem was this is what happened after I did the
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.160]   first 25 let it sit and then then run it again at 10.5 for me this was the
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.320]   two avocados and this was the sunflower and you can see how it did filter out a
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.440]   whole bunch of you know impurities for that lack of a better word and so it
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.120]   worked really well and then I figured okay well now that I you know I filtered
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.600]   out the impurities and then it looked like this I wasn't happy so let's go
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.080]   ahead and try filtering it through one of these to see if I could get it better
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.040]   and then what happened was was I did I got it better but the problem was the
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.920]   thing was this is the filter and it got blocked so fast that I only got about
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.480]   50 milliliters out of it and so it is a huge waste of $7 if you're only gonna
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:15.080]   get a little itty-bitty bit of C60 oil out of it you know and product so the
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.160]   one thing I do want to share with you though through this learning experience
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.120]   that I have learned I want to share with you don't use these guys just buy
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.040]   yourself a third set of filters the little paper round things that you can
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.560]   stick right in here and if you're only gonna do a 37 cents each so I'm
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.240]   figuring that for me to run the whole batch like this whole thing full it got
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.440]   blocked at 50 milliliters you're probably gonna use up maybe six to eight of these
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.960]   guys to go through here but you know six to eight of these guys is so much
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.920]   cheaper than this so that's another thing I want to share with you is buy the
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.440]   0.22s use them on your pulver IC60 as your third filter use this rig it's so
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.240]   much cheaper if you use paper filters and then that way you know you know this
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.600]   gets blocked and you have to throw it away so it's cheaper to throw a piece of
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.760]   paper away than it is throw the whole filter thing away and that's how you get
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:15.840]   perfection that's avocado and sunflower oil experiments one two and four so as
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.920]   you know I tinker and so one of the things I wanted to do was experiment
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:24.200]   number two which was what would happen you know because you know you guys
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.800]   watched my other video where I was using powdered C60 regular powdered C60
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.840]   and you know yeah I had some like this film of it left in the bottom of the
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.360]   sonicator when I was using that little guy and I wanted to see if I could
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.640]   capture that because you know this is not cheap stuff so I poured more oil in I
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.600]   sonicated it up and boom I was able to make a second batch and not waste any C60
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:54.960]   so with pulverized 60 I'm sorry pulverized C60 I wanted to see if I could do
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.880]   the same thing with that so when I had finished doing the first filtering I took
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.720]   the flask I like I do just like I do with the powder if it's like you know let's
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.840]   say as an example 100 milliliters I'd add you know the first batch the second
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   batch would be half of that so I added 50 percent more oil to the flask and then
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.760]   I basically sonicated that or stirred it and sonicated it and let it sit
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.480]   filtered out and then after two filters you know just treating it like a fresh
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.120]   batch trying to see if I could claim you know reclaim the residual avocado
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.440]   oil I'm sorry that residual C60 on the bottom of the flask this is what it
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:40.560]   turned out it came out this real weird orange color after I filtered it the
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.200]   two times I didn't filter this the third time because when I was looking at
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.520]   this and it just wasn't coming out because this is what it what a normal
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.560]   batch would look like this was me trying to reclaim a residual batch and if you
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.120]   take a look at the Sun you know you know you have it's really nice to have the
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.640]   Sun behind you to do this take a look at this color now this is the perfection
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:07.600]   batch this is the cloudy avocado this is the cloudy sunflower oil and then this
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.560]   is that residual that my attempt at reclaiming residual in it it's like this
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:17.360]   funky orange color and I just didn't like the color I didn't think I just
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.120]   think and this is my opinion is that because what Martin at Red Lion had said
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.360]   was you know that the C60 at the monomolecular level binds with all the
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.200]   impurities of the oil and it all floats to the sinks to the bottom and so what
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.920]   you're seeing there is not really C60 on the bottom it's like this impurity
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:43.160]   sludge for lack of a better word and when I try to use that sludge to make C60
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.480]   oil I got this kind of gross looking orange stuff so I threw it away and so
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.720]   my personal recommendation is is don't bother trying to save that stuff and I'm
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.360]   sure Martin will agree because he always talks about frequency and that stuff's
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:01.000]   real low frequency and this beautiful purple color is high frequency you know
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.640]   and it's better for you and this is not as good for you so that experiment did
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.520]   not work out well actually it worked out I got results and the results taught me
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.400]   something so what it taught me was don't bother and I threw all that out and
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.120]   didn't and didn't mess with it so I learned something there as well and that
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.880]   takes us through experiments one two three and four no before I talk about
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.400]   experiment five I wanted to just share with you something that's kind of cool
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.240]   which is how do you make or I'm sorry how do you synthesize C60 and so what's
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.160]   really cool is since my last video a lady who's got a channel called her name
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:43.160]   is Gwen Foster has a YouTube channel and she had on as an interviewee this guy
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:48.000]   and this guy is Chris Burris of SES research and so for any of you who
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.800]   were actually read the 2012 you know Paris rat study that started off the
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:59.760]   whole C60 oil craze thing you know the whole this guy is one of the co-founders
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:06.720]   of the company that sold the C60 powder to the French who used it in that rat
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:13.320]   study and they have been around since 1991 so think about that these folks
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.400]   when you know if you listen to the interview it's a fascinating backstory
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.280]   SES or Chris Burris and his partner Anthony some I'm sorry don't remember
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.800]   the last name those two guys actually work with the three Nobel laureate
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:33.760]   winning scientists who discovered C60 in 86 and they won the Nobel Prize in 96
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:38.640]   and and Anthony and Chris together worked with those guys the graduates
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:45.180]   students for that professor to figure out exactly how they did it you know you
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.560]   know to just how they discovered it and how they synthesized it and then they
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:54.560]   use that process at SES to make C60 powder that and they are they made the
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:01.320]   one of the major suppliers in the US so really really in tune plugged in person
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.280]   and she interviews this guy first time this guy ever showed up on YouTube so
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.560]   if you watch the video it's really cool if you're into this stuff and he talks
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:15.280]   about how you make C60 and so in this in his discussion he was talking about
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:21.880]   they use they have to create an arc basically a little bolt of lightning
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:28.920]   goes between two quarter inch graphite rods inside of a vacuum sealed tube I
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.600]   think they're using argon gas or something helium and and so and then
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.280]   that's and then the soot that just flies off of it and this thing is like the
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.560]   heat of the Sun right and then the sit that flies off of it is captured and then
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:49.880]   they use solvent so that's step two of the process is they use solvents or SES
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:54.440]   uses solvents okay because he says in his video by the way links and links in
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.040]   the description as you guys know and he says in the in the video that you know
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:07.680]   that the way that SES does it is they use solvents to then dissolve the C60 in
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.120]   the toiline and then they do something with that fluid and they separate out
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:17.840]   the different colors that represent the different carbons C60 C70 and so forth
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.760]   and that's how SES does it so then once SES separates out the color that they
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:29.600]   want of the C60 inside the toiline which is really toxic by the way they put it
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.480]   in a in a baking chamber and they bake off the the basically heat up and bake
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.880]   off the the solvent and the toiline is gone and then they proclaim it solvent
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.920]   free and sell it to us right the other thing he actually touches on it but he
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.320]   doesn't go into much detail but he actually says in his video he says well
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.400]   there's a other way to do it and that's the sublimation process and he
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:58.360]   mentions that it's really very very much more complicated and expensive and so
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.640]   they don't do it that way at SES so so this is a real interesting and the
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.920]   reason I'm talking about this is because I like to tinker and so if there's a
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.080]   different C60 out there or different oil I'm gonna try it to see what happens
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.100]   because that's what I do so I just wanted to I will one other thing I do
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.720]   want to share with you this is a kind of a cool video that I stumbled across
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:29.600]   that's an example of how C60 is synthesized so like in this video I'm
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.720]   see if I can find it it's just this video links in the below but this is an
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.320]   experiment in a lab where they take this chamber okay and this is the
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.920]   description it's in German so it's translated and the translation comes out
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.160]   to generation of stardust fullerenes in a vacuum in a helium atmosphere by
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.860]   evaporation of graphite rods in an arc okay so here you go and so this is
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:55.860]   actually how scientists create or I'm sorry extracts C60 that's in that it's
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:01.340]   in a tube of helium and then they create that arc between two graphite rods as
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:06.660]   you just saw and then there you go so there it goes and and this is the video
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.660]   it's really kind of cool so you can see the carbon building up on the inside of
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:15.720]   the tube very very hot this is actually the temperature of the Sun I mean as
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:21.140]   you know lightning bolts or are the temperature of the Sun it fries both of
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.940]   those graphite rods the suit accumulates on the outside or I'm sorry the inside
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.340]   of the tube and that's actually step one of the process so let's see if they
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.100]   turn the lights back on and there you go and that's that's right here so then
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.780]   what you would do is you would scrape that off and that's your step one okay
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:40.540]   and so this is kind of a cool thing I wanted to share that with you forgot I
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:46.260]   put it in this line so now what is sublime C60 so where I got the sublime
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:54.380]   C60 which is basically advertised at 99.99 plus so that means it could you know
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:16:00.460]   it literally is 99.999 you know and it's so pure and because the way they did it
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.660]   they didn't use solvents which is that's my thing I don't want to you know I
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:10.540]   don't want to take in solvents but I asked Dr. Marco Vich of MTR limited you
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:15.100]   know links in video description what a sublimation process was and this is a
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.620]   direct quote email basically from MTR they said you know they don't do it like
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:25.620]   SES they do it their own way actually I'm sorry they do have non sublime C60 on
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.980]   their website and they have sublime so they actually have they do it both ways
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:35.340]   sorry and so but I wanted to try the sublime oh and one gram of the 99.99
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:41.940]   percent sublime C60 at MTR is one hundred and nine dollars okay and if you buy
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:49.660]   the non-sublimed 99.95 I think it's like 59 bucks so MTR by the way by that has
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:55.260]   the best prices on raw C60 and links below so anyway that's enough about that
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.780]   but anyway the sublimation process is within many years we produce the
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:05.620]   spherical fullerenes by Marta modified Arc discharge Kachmir Huffman
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:10.580]   production method and then for their separation of precision purification we
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:15.900]   use advanced sublimation technology which is the fullerenes are vaporized in a
[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.540]   vacuum based on a special temperature gradient techniques which do not
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.380]   involve solvents and therefore avoids any possible contamination from solvent
[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.460]   use and comment solvent based purification technology it's very
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:33.180]   important for effective application application sublime fullerenes in bio
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:38.420]   medicine it is 100% solvent free so you know it is kind of cool so for those of
[00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:44.340]   you guys who are really really really conscious of you know you don't want to
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:49.500]   take anything that's been run through a toxic chemical even though SES and
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:55.980]   and MTR themselves they sell a non-sublimed but the non-sublimed still has
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.620]   gone through toluene right through the process if the toluene has been fired
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:06.100]   off and what's left is the powder the granular powder okay but in this other
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.980]   process which is twice as expensive to buy because it's twice as much work it
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.180]   never touches any solvents at all and they just they just vaporize it and so
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:20.260]   there is a second way and it's called sublime and so one of the cool things
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.300]   about working with MTR as opposed to SES though I'm not picking favorites by
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:29.080]   the way but MTR is really cool I did ask for certification of the other
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.500]   fullerenes that I was buying link below if you want to take a read and I
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:37.980]   honestly don't understand what most of this is saying to me but this is a HPLC
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:42.980]   high-performance liquid chroma chromatography purity analysis of sublime
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:51.420]   fullerene C60 99.99 so this is a if anyone ever asks for or wants to show
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:58.340]   you this is a what they call a material specifications that proves to you it's
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:04.700]   their certificate that this is what it it says it is and so this is what that
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.060]   report looks like and I actually gave you a copy if you want to take a look at
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:13.340]   it in the video description so that's kind of the story behind C60 there's
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:18.420]   two different ways that are known to make it and that is through solvents and
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:23.700]   through sublime so what happens when you use the one that's sublime now this is
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:29.220]   a thing I only this is what I did I just basically took powder I stirred it for
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.820]   two weeks just like the rat study and I just didn't I at the time I just didn't
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.620]   have a 0.22 filter so I just use my my closest one which is 10.5 and look at it
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:43.660]   it just came out beautiful I mean this is this is as perfect as this look at
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:49.180]   that that's with the pulverized three filters and this is with one filter and
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:54.300]   that's the sublime I mean it is so pure that it just turned purple and perfect
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.700]   in the very first attempt and I didn't even sonicate it I just stirred it up
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:02.500]   so for those of you who are really into super super high quality you know
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.740]   products and and you know ingredients for what you're doing you know you might
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.140]   want to try this it's pretty cool and I was very very happy with how it turned
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:15.060]   out it's just this deep beautiful purple and I was very satisfied with it so
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:19.340]   that was actually a little test I was like a hundred milliliter test so now
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.300]   there's no so here's the thing about about C60 so those are the two ways
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:28.860]   right now according to individual named Bob Greska of a product called Carbon
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:33.860]   Dash 60 that he's created a third way and so what I wanted to share with you was
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:38.540]   that here's the third thing the Carbon Dash 60 I did the exact same thing but
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:42.140]   this is the kind of thing like I was saying about the mother right if you saw
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:47.620]   there's a video he put out where he shows like one gram of his C60 powder
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:52.420]   compared to one gram of everybody else's C60 powder and everybody else is like
[00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.060]   this little tiny itty-bitty pile in a dish and his is like the whole freaking
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:00.620]   dish is full right and it's so poofy and it's so you know it's so fine and he
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:04.700]   shakes it up in the flask and it's like it's just like fine I mean it is like
[00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:09.420]   just like soot you know basically it's like black air I mean it's so fine so I
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:13.580]   thought that was really cool and so like I said I decided well you know could I
[00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:18.740]   use this to make C60 oil because you're thinking of it like like how you get
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.940]   pulverized C60 right you get it floating in alcohol well I was thinking well if
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.660]   I go to you know see see I mean sorry Carbon Dash 60 and buy a bottle of that
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.700]   it's like C60 floating in sunflower oil right so same kind of concept right
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:38.220]   you get a C60 in a fluid so I took so this was experiment number six was I
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:43.500]   took the Carbon 60 I doubled the amount of oil so all I had I was because I was
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.460]   taking it myself for a while and so all I had left was about 40 milliliters so I
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:52.980]   made 80 milliliters of sunflower oil organic cold pressed sunflower oil and
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.340]   then I did the same thing I stirred it for two weeks and I filtered it through
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:01.420]   the 10.5 micron filter and then the solution came out and this is what it
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:06.740]   looks like and so this is it came out black and and there's no purple coloration
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:13.100]   so what's real interesting and I and I just want to point this out was this is
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:18.860]   pure C60 never touched to solvent and it's purple so there's nothing in it
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:25.900]   other than C60 so that means the true color of C60 is purple and so now the
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:31.780]   C-60 product is claiming to be C60 and it comes out black so and of course is
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.300]   proprietary and I don't blame him he doesn't want to share how he makes it and
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.940]   he doesn't want to sell the powder so the only way you can do this is to buy
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.340]   the product and then do what I did but you know here's the thing though after I
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:48.340]   filtered it it does liposomal the carbon in the oil and you get this this this
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:55.300]   dark colored C60 oil okay and so you can make C60 oil with that product but it
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:23:00.060]   doesn't look like the other C60 oil and I I look at that as the third way and so
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:04.580]   I just want to show you too here's the the difference in the filters when I
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:10.100]   filtered out the carbon see carbon - 60 you know I got basically the carbon came
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:15.580]   out and then it turned into that and then when I filtered out the sublime C60
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:19.460]   like basically nothing came out I'll just blow this up a little bit so you can
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.940]   see it a little bit closer but basically nothing the filter what whoop that didn't
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:32.900]   work out there we go a little bit too big I'm sorry sorry okay but sir there
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.140]   you go and so this is the sublime C60 over here and so you could see where
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:42.240]   even though there was a residual in both flasks the filter was everything all of
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.020]   this went straight through the filter and there was nothing caught up and then
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.540]   you could see where the actual carbon - 60 actually filtered out some of the
[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:55.740]   whatever the impurities of the oil or the C60 that was floating in it but at the
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:00.300]   end of the day though it still made it through the filter and you actually end
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:04.420]   up with a carbon 60 oil it just doesn't look purple and that's that's the end of
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:10.180]   that so those are my six experiments I'm just tinkering around I know some of
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.740]   you are very interested in this stuff so I just am here to share and I hope this
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:18.140]   was educational and interesting for you and hey I thank you very much for
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.380]   stopping by I know you know there's a million videos for you to watch every
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.580]   day and for you to watch one of mine I am humbled and I'm very appreciative and
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.420]   thank you for stopping by I hope you have a great day keep learning keep
[00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:34.580]   experimenting keep doing your thing and and you know what we only get better by
