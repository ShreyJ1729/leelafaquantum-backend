[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   Well hello everyone it's K Almer here and this video is on hydrogen. More specifically
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.960]   how to increase your intake of hydrogen or H2 as you might also call it. This is a video
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.240]   that was requested by one of the viewers of my last video. I wanted to know a little
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.320]   bit more about it so let's just jump right in. First things first you know the disclaimer
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.600]   so hey number one. None of the thing I say ever is medical advice especially in any video.
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.880]   This is not a product endorsement. I am going to list a lot of different products today and
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.760]   I am not endorsing any of them specifically. I do not sell any H2 products. I do not get
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.640]   paid to do any videos in any way shape or form. I do this purely because I have a habit
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.920]   of really taking deep dives into anything that's interesting to me and so it just conjures
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.720]   up a lot of stuff that's research related that I'm more than happy to share with you
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.600]   guys. And lastly so I don't have to say links below 50 times throughout the video. I just
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.680]   want to say up front that the links almost everything I'm going to say today is in the
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.280]   video description. If you want to learn more you know go down there take a look at the links.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.440]   There's a lot of really interesting stuff in this video so let's go forward. First things
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.080]   first in the last video I did talk about the healing effects of hydrogen as compared to
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.700]   C60. So here's a little bit more of an expansion of that health benefits of hydrogen. You know
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.280]   encourage everybody just to pause the video take a look at this you know because there's
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.160]   27 specific reasons here. This is courtesy of self-hack.com. The link I'm sorry I don't
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.000]   I keep talking about the links. But you know the links are below right and so but there's
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.040]   there in that link there's specifically they go into depth about each separate bullet.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.360]   You notice the word that excuse me you'll notice that the word may is in there a lot
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.720]   because there's a lot of research still going on but you know the health benefits of hydrogen
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.560]   go back I mean decades and decades and so there's just a lot of stuff that they've proven
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.160]   there's a lot of stuff that they're still trying to prove and it is seriously one of
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.600]   the most beneficial elements that you could take into your body that's straight out of
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.200]   nature and so it's good stuff let's just let's just assume it's good and move forward
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.960]   and just talk about what this video is about which is the ways to intake hydrogen you know
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.400]   how can you increase taking in hydrogen because it's so good for you especially if you're
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.000]   taking C60 as well and so let's just talk about that and I also want to just point out
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.960]   before we get too deep into this that this video is not about this special different
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.720]   ways that each single you know product works and so forth I don't want to get that deep
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.000]   into it because literally if you go and just search on YouTube you will find thousands
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.800]   of videos on hydrogen and I really don't want to put out a redundant video so this is just
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.920]   going to talk about the ways you do it at very high level I'm not going to get too deep
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.040]   I provide links if you want to get deeper into it but this is simply high level and this
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.360]   is definitely not a product review we're not comparing products to products if that's
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.200]   something that you wanted you know there's tons of videos out there for you so go ahead
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.880]   and knock yourself out anyway ways to intake hydrogen there's four basic ways from my deep
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.000]   dive into it you can breathe it drink it eat it and absorb it it's just that simple you
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.160]   know so let's just talk start with the breath it now they have hydrogen inhalation machines
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.160]   and the picture is courtesy of California hydrogen water and you can see there's different models
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.480]   and you know and the whole thing about breathing and hydrogen is that it is absolutely you know
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.080]   hydrogen is good for you breathing it in is good for you there's actual studies out there
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.200]   that are looking at ways to give cardiac arrest patients hydrogen and it helps them
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.040]   cerebral damage patients are getting hydrogen now and there's all sorts of different reasons
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.880]   you would want to breathe it in from a vascular standpoint and getting it into your lungs like
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.080]   if I were to have a lung problem I would definitely want to be doing inhalation of hydrogen so
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.040]   it's a really good thing there is a way to do it but I just want to point out you know it's a
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.840]   it's a very pricey way to do it if you want to bring in you know bringing hydrogen into your body
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.800]   I mean you can look at these prices they're not low okay and so it's for people who kind of have
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.720]   the money for it it's also too you're going to put it's you know it's big this thing's going to
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.240]   sit next to your couch you're going to hook up you're going to be sitting there for a long time
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.640]   so it's not meant for the person that wants hydrogen on the run or take it to the office kind of thing
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:38.440]   but definitely if you go to the links I guess I can't get away from it California hydrogen water
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.560]   actually has a full page of all sorts of different scientific material supporting inhalation of
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.480]   hydrogen so if you want more there's a whole page full of links that you can look at and so
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.640]   definitely breathing it is one way and it's it's one way that a lot of people go
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.120]   the other way now is to drink it and and I think that this is the this is the 400 pound
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.480]   you know gorilla of hydrogen it's it's the drinking part whereas there's only like maybe I don't know
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.600]   maybe a dozen different inhalation machines when you talk about drinking hydrogen it gets into
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:18.520]   the hundreds and so it kind of just classified it in five simple ways to look at it there's actually
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.480]   a video a guy did who's actually the the maker of the ultra stream brand and he did a video about
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.480]   the 11 ways you can get hydrogen you know via hydrogen water and so if you know watch that if
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.640]   you want to all 11 I boiled it down for you for two five because you're busy you don't have time
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.080]   for that but here you go you've got these big machines they sit on your countertop they plug in
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.800]   and I this actually just want to let you know I mean of these five specific brands right here
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.720]   I own I've had them all I used to own these two I own these two now I never did buy a countertop
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.480]   brand I just kind of jumped to straight over to portable but you know this is the only one I
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.720]   haven't owned so I'm talking from personal experience I owned the Jupiter I had that for
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.840]   about four years owned this for a couple years owned this now tried this so you know the whole
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.200]   idea is I'm very familiar with these things I've lived with them so a Jupiter brand basically is
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.880]   connects to your faucet and what this is going to be and this is going to be the
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.080]   ultra stream in the Jupiter you know they're water filters and they produce H2 and they produce
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.200]   alkaline water so if you want to get hydrogen you know and you and you need those other features
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.440]   or you have the money and they're not cheap you know then you know obviously these are the two
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.240]   different ways so this one is basically one that plugs in it requires electricity it does
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.640]   electrolysis or it uses a different type of technology called a PM which is a proton exchange
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:47.880]   membrane so there's two different ways you can extract the H2 from the H2o your water and so
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.840]   those are the two ways that it does it and it's usually electricity now the ultra stream doesn't
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:59.320]   use electricity in this type of filters multiple there's multiples of these right of these kinds
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.440]   and they basically just do a chemical reaction which is exactly the same reaction over here
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.560]   sort of okay whereas you have tablets you just drop it in water and it's a chemical reaction
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.800]   between malic acid and magnesium and water and it produces H2 over here it actually is the inside
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.240]   the water filter itself has a layer of magnesium and as the water passes through that magnesium it
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.720]   creates a chemical reaction a non-toxic chemical reaction that produces H2 and alkaline water
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.960]   right out it comes so that's how that one does it so this one's more of a electrolysis or a PEM
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:41.640]   this one's more of a chemical reaction now this type of countertop H2 water creator
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.600]   maker generator or whatever you want to use as a word that puppy does it electrolysis which is
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.200]   basically passing the water through two different charged metal plates and it creates it separates
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:59.000]   out the H2 and the O so you have H2 molecules and then you have the free oxygen the O molecule which
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.240]   sticks to another O molecule and you have oxygen so you have oxygen bubbles you you see the bubbles
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.120]   coming out the H2 is a molecule it just you can't see it all you when you see the bubbles it's
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:14.280]   the oxygen bubbles and the H2 you know but it's more so you're looking at oxygen but bottom line
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.160]   though it's it splits out the two to create oxygen and hydrogen and then of course a lot of water
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.520]   because it's it's on a very small basis but that's electrolysis in a nutshell and so these things
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.960]   just you know basically have a couple of charged plates down here and the water bubbles up into
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.640]   there and that's a countertop version and this is the smaller version of that same thing it does
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:40.520]   electrolysis to create the H2 and it's portable it's a little tiny 12 ounce thing and then there's
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:46.280]   H2 tablets a chemical reaction and I just described that so that's the five ways to drink it now I
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:52.200]   did kind of do a pros and cons template for you or I'm sorry a table and just to kind of walk
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.840]   through it just again I think it's really good for because the main question I made this video
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.960]   for was somebody asked you know can you walk through the different kinds of H2 water generators
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:08.920]   you know and so that's what I'm trying to do and so right now here the pros so the thing about the
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.200]   Jupiter and like I said I own these guys you know the thing about it and the ultra stream when when
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.000]   I owned it it was called the Alco Way you know they filter the water so you're buying two products
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.600]   now you're buying a water filter and you're getting an H2 generator so you know the good thing is is
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.720]   the Jupiter is a pretty big little machine you know and that big little big machine it sits on
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.920]   the countertop it plugs into the electrical socket you have to connect it to your faucet so you have
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:40.200]   so here's the thing about these two puppies if you have a faucet which I now have I have one of those
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:46.120]   you pull out the the thing out of the the faucet and it ends up being a shower spray handle thing
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:52.440]   you can't connect anything to that unless you go under the sink so connecting it to your faucet
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.600]   is a challenge depending on what kind of faucet you have and so if you have some fancy
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.440]   ass brawn thing you touch with your finger you're going to connect this thing to it you're going to
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:06.360]   have to get a plumber and connect it up underneath your countertop so and so there's a little bit
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:12.040]   of an installation issue with both of these because they are attached to the faucet right there so
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.280]   that's an issue right and then but the thing the good stuff is that this the Jupiter is really fast
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.680]   you turn that puppy on and boom you're getting water out quick or the ultra stream that thing
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:26.120]   is slow you try to fill up a one gallon jug with an ultra stream you're going to be waiting a while
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.520]   a lot longer than you would with the Jupiter and that's that's kind of a con so you know definitely
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:35.720]   something to think about you know the good news is there's no electricity required but the thing
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:41.640]   is it's slow and the thing about both of these guys is they don't they're not cheap okay when I
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:46.520]   bought my Jupiter I paid like 800 bucks for it but these puppies can go up like four thousand
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.840]   dollars and they're they're not cheap and then when the ultra stream the aqua way is running
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:56.040]   around 700 and then the key thing here is filters these two things right here are the only things
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.600]   that generate H2 that you got to keep buying stuff for you know it's that whole reoccurring revenue
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.000]   model that every merchant vendor in the world wants you know it's a cash cow down the road like
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.920]   a printer you know I would buy a printer right for your computer they basically give you the
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.800]   printer and you have to pay for ink for the rest of your life so it's the same thing here you buy
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.520]   these guys and you keep paying and paying and paying and the overall cost down this you know down
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:23.160]   the road is really quite expensive I mean these guys do not it's like I think a Jupiter field
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:29.880]   filters like 95 bucks ultra stream I think was 105 you know so and I own these for years so there's
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.640]   a long-term cost associated on top of the front end costs and so they're very expensive but they're
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.800]   good they work they're awesome products so if you have the money you have the counter space
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.200]   blah blah you can afford to have that thing installed and you know hey it's an old it's an
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:50.520]   alternative for people who want H2 out of the faucet at home and that's a really important part
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.320]   it's it's out of the faucet at home you're not carrying this thing around now the lordis is like
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.720]   a Brita filter you know picture thing right it's gonna sit on your countertop it does take up a
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.440]   space but it's got a smaller footprint not attached to anything it's like a coffee maker you fill up
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.400]   the take there's no filters in there I mean there's a actually tiny filter but you know it's easy to
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:15.320]   clean you don't have to pay gobs of money to keep the thing around for a while so the pros are
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:20.040]   that it's fast I mean it works just as fast as any of the other electrolysis machines that are
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:25.240]   you know basically portable and you can carry it around so if you were like to drink a lot of
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.280]   this stuff at work you could you could take it to work but it's going to take up some space
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.840]   yeah but you have to keep filling up the tank and and it does cost and so here's the thing
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:39.080]   about this is I was like looking at these things before I bought my kingdom one and you know they
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.400]   were running around 300 bucks I saw one that went was 300 bucks for a few months and then
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:49.480]   popped up to 500 I was like that was a intense increase in price but so but they do you can still
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:55.720]   find them around 300 to a thousand dollars oh lordis this this one specifically this red puppy here
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:01.480]   it's called the lordis or lords I'm not sure how they want to pronounce it that puppy is a thousand
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:07.560]   dollars a thousand dollars for a pitcher that's gonna say you know I don't know if if you you've
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:15.560]   got money I'm not I'm not bathing in it so to me that's a lot of money and I'm not really you know
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:22.440]   gaming to spend that on on on on a pitcher of that creates h2 water so but you know so I'm saying
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:28.120]   it is expensive but the good news is there's no long-term costs and from the videos and research
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.800]   I've done on this product specifically this one you know it's got some staying parts gonna last
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.920]   for a while like I said earlier this is it they're really obviously very important point is how
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.840]   long do these things last you know so like I said the Jupiter lasts about four to five years
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.880]   the altar stream last actually I had the alcaway before this one and the only reason I don't still
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:51.080]   use the alcaway is because they retired it nobody sells the filters for it anymore and they created
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.680]   this new brand called the altar stream and I did not I did not want to upgrade because I had you
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.320]   know I just I just I just don't like having to buy filters so now here's the thing the the kingdom
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.760]   guy which is this little puppy here this little it's literally it's bigger than a soda can it's
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:10.520]   like that big monster can you know that's as big as it is it's so it's nice and portable I love it
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.000]   it's got that it's portable there's no I have not I don't have to buy anything I just got to
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.760]   charge it it's a battery it's really fast two minutes and you've got hydrogen water the cons
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:27.960]   battery life I mean this thing promises 27 you know charges per per you know I mean that 27
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:33.560]   uses per battery charge I'm getting like half that you know because I like to double charge the
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:40.360]   water before I drink and I like to get it really milky colored and so I give it two times every
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:47.000]   time I drink it so I pretty much use it about seven times which is 14 before I got a plug it into
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.400]   the wall again so the battery is not what they promise it's cheaper it's plastic I did get it off
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.360]   Amazon because the one thing about these things and I you do all the reading on these things and
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:03.880]   you're gonna find out that everybody warns you off of buying no brand name ones from China on
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.040]   eBay okay that's just like nobody wants to do that so yeah you know so that's what I mean when you
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:14.840]   get it down to you get a $40 one or they go up to 300 they can get pricey the recommendations are
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:20.280]   do not buy one from China that's manufactured in China and if it's 30 bucks and you can pretty much
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:26.200]   imagine how cheap the parts are but the best ones are the ones that have been making them for decades
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:32.200]   I mean the Asians have been so into this for so long I mean we're talking you know 70s and stuff that
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:39.400]   they started making these things so the best ones are from Japan and South Korea and so I
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.800]   bought this little kingdom off of Amazon because it had really good reviews I'm using it I love
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:49.720]   it but I know this thing you know I could just look it's not gonna last very long and so I just
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.640]   know it because I think the battery is probably not gonna be able to keep a charge after a while so
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:57.240]   I'm thinking I'm gonna get about six months good use out of it so I just went ahead and bought a
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:04.440]   new one for 93 bucks it's a South Korean one off of Amazon and a Twitter friend of mine had bought
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:10.760]   one and showed it off on Twitter and it was like really super nicely packaged all metal and glass
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.720]   I mean you could tell the quality was there and it's like 93 dollars and so he's got this really
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:21.160]   good one and I had like you know like you know H2 water generator envy and so I just had to order
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.080]   mine so that when mine dies I'll have a backup but I have a feeling of why I just switched to using
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:30.680]   it and they also you know that was 93 bucks right and then they go up to 300 the last one is the H2
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:36.200]   Viva that's the tablets that's the you know the actual tablets the concepts of tablets now it's
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:41.240]   quite simple they just make a they compress magnesium and malic acid using a binder and they create
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.040]   tablets like you would take a vitamin and there's usually 30 to 60 tablets per bottle and you buy
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:52.120]   these little bottles and then you need to get you get either a metal bottle or a glass bottle you
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:59.400]   fill it up with water and you drop it like a tablet into the water and seal it up the tablet
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:04.280]   dissolves and when it dissolves it does exactly what you would see you see all the bubbles coming up
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:11.960]   and it it it releases H2 it releases over one and then O1 becomes O2 and then the bottle gets
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:17.080]   basically compressed as you know because the whole thing about H2 and and getting it into water
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.320]   is through pressure and so with the water with the bottle sealed like you know like when you use
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:27.480]   this guy it's sealed when you use this guy it's sealed you drop a tablet and a bottle you know
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.360]   top it off and seal the tight it's sealed and it creates pressure and that pressure in there is
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:39.480]   what infuses that H2 into the water and so that's really it it's just using tablets and when using
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.880]   tablets you know the good stuff about it the pros it's very portable I mean carrying this
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:49.400]   little bottle around it's super easy and you actually get extra magnesium because what happens is is
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:56.840]   the magnesium is it is in a you know powder formants as the H2 is created in the malic acid and in
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:03.320]   the magnesium and the water react you get this film of magnesium on the very bottom of the bottle
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:08.520]   you drink the water and it tastes a little metallic because that magnesium is in there
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.560]   and but you get you actually can take a magnesium it's like a magnesium supplement water kind of
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:19.720]   thing when you drink it but and so and then when you are done after a while the very bottom of the
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.680]   bottle builds up this film of magnesium and it starts to oxidate and turns white and you got to
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.640]   throw it out and get a new bottle so that's kind of what I mean over here where you frequently
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:33.880]   after you get new bottles I use like you know well I just keep by like a kombucha bottle the
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:39.000]   aluminum beer bottles you know any kind of bottle that can seal really well so I usually use a
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.400]   glass kombucha bottle for mine and the thing about it though is it is slow you have to wait 20
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:52.600]   minutes minimum before you can drink it and so you know whereas if I use my kingdom it's 120
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:57.320]   seconds it's super fast you know and so when you pour cold water in there and you want a cold
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:03.240]   glass of water you can you can do it with kingdom or I'm sorry well just the concept of a portable
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:09.480]   but when you use the tablets you I pour my cold water in it I put the tablet in it I seal it off
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.800]   I stick it there on my desk and I'm working and working and working you know timer goes off 20
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.880]   seconds and the water already got kind of warm you know it's not cold anymore and so it takes a
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.320]   long to me 20 minutes is a long time to wait to get a drink you know when I'm thirsty I want to
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:25.960]   drink right so it's slow and then you know the bottles and then so but the thing about it though
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:33.560]   if you catch a good sale you can get it down to 30 bucks a bottle or seven or six up to 60 it's
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.600]   you know it just it blows my mind how expensive these things are but a little little bottle of
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.960]   pills you know little tablets will cost you 60 bucks and so that's you know that's it's an
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:50.840]   alternative right so it is one of the five ways to drink it and just to kind of give you an idea I
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:56.120]   kind of like walked away from this guy and this guy as they died off I didn't want to do it I
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.000]   don't want anything this big and what I've really come to learn in love is that I use this portable
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.320]   guy because I'm on the move I mean you know where do we spend our most time in life we didn't see
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:10.680]   their sleep or at work right and so I'm at work I keep this puppy in my bag I take it to work with
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:16.200]   me I use it like a minimum five times a day just drinking my water at work and then I bring it back
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:22.280]   home on weekends with me I keep the tablets because this when this thing dies or the battery star
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.280]   doesn't have enough of a charge it just starts to flash red at you and so you know you're really
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:30.520]   thirsty you want to make a glass and the things start blinking and you're like oh I mean you're
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:35.240]   great I don't get to use it so I could just you know I just kind of use this instead when this
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:39.640]   guy's down and I got to charge it up it does take quite a bit to charge like about an hour or two or
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.040]   so but you know I really favor these guys because they're really portable I have a very
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.120]   portable life and so I don't like hang out at the house if you hang out at the house a lot then
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.680]   yeah you can go with one of these other puppies I think that's logical and so I just want to give
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.480]   you a comparison though from a cost standpoint so I told you what the costs are on the various
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:02.440]   different machines and then how they work and and what's good and bad about them from my personal
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:08.440]   opinion but I just wanted to give you just this little cost reality check because it's a huge deal
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.640]   from a cost-preserving standpoint I'm just looking at generators versus tablets okay just the
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:18.840]   portables and just the tablets though I'm just comparing those two this puppy costs 70 dollars
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.720]   the and I I'm gonna guess it's gonna last six months before the battery just ain't gonna keep up
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:30.680]   within anymore and so I do about five times a day if I you know five days a week 100 servings a month
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:36.040]   so it really comes out to 12 cents a serving a 12 ounce you know gulp and serving of H2 water
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.200]   and it's only going to it's cost me 12 cents a serving but you know when you start doing tablets
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:46.120]   it's 40 dollars a bottle roughly right now I just looked at the prices and so that comes out if I
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:51.560]   wanted to do and you know and it's you need one one tablet per serving now and you know and I've
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:56.920]   actually read studies where people have gone up to three tablets per bottle to just really get a
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:04.760]   strong level of H2 in that bottle and but you know just at one tablet a bottle that's 67 cents
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:10.120]   per serving so you can see the huge cost difference between tablets and generators so
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.160]   you know so you know and that's something to consider and by the way the reason I got into
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.720]   tablets was I just wanted to check them out you know and I wanted to try it out and I kind of
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:24.600]   hang down to the bottle is like I said when this battery dies I got this as my backup so with all
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:30.120]   that said about drinking water there's a lot more information you know where and then I do
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:35.320]   want to touch on one little idea here is this thing about whenever whenever you get into the
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:42.520]   drinking hydrogen water thing everybody's got a rip out the PPM which is the parts per million
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:49.160]   of H2 is just you know infused into the water argument and you know every machine has that PPM
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.920]   that's kind of like trying to buy anything else that's their common denominator and how they
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.880]   judge the machine so these guys bought these two guys are going to run anywhere from .6
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:04.280]   to 1.0 PPM there is a way to use tablets to get a much higher PPM but that's not the focus of
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.280]   this video but I just wanted to point out that they're pretty much the same and then here's one
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:14.280]   thing too this is parts per million so when you're shopping around and someone says oh my product
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:26.040]   can do 1.5 and the other guy goes oh my product can do 1.6 you know what that's okay 0.00006 versus
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:34.200]   0.00005 I mean really is you know that that does that's not a lot of a difference
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:41.240]   so I really you know it's just kind of crazy when they can you know try to like you know get
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.840]   comparison on that level you just really want to get hydrogen in anything under you know if it's
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.760]   not at least 0.6 and don't bother with the product I don't think anyone even sells one that does
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:55.240]   that but that's kind of the whole PPM thing and I don't get too deep into it you can if you want
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.800]   blah blah blah oh anyway when I first started looking at getting tablets just to try them out
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:05.400]   as you probably can guess I did a tablet price pricing guide so the most part I can I think
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.720]   it's like I came up with like seven different products that I could find priced them out just
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:15.480]   like it did the C60 pricing guide and you know what is you can go find it okay now next eat it
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.040]   you can eat hydrogen and you eat hydrogen all the time you're already doing it you don't even
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:24.280]   know you're doing it every single thing you eat has hydrogen in it because why because in
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.280]   everything you drink it's got water in it at h2o right your body breaks it down you get hydrogen
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.200]   so there's hydrogen everywhere we're always taking in but the idea here is you want to take in a
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:36.920]   lot more because it's healthier for you so you want to take in higher concentrations of of hydrogen
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:43.720]   for your own health benefit etc so when you do some research on the hydrogen content in foods
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:49.080]   and the things that we consume one of the most important the way I'm not more important but the
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:55.720]   the thing you focus in on is the hydrogen ion concentration in in in comparison to pH right
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:01.160]   and so what I when I started looking at was like okay well what's the best foods to eat to get
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.400]   hydrogen and as I mentioned in my last video is apples right and so apples is the main thing
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:10.760]   the people can recommend and it's true it actually has and the reason is is because of its acidity
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:18.200]   so what I'm trying to point out is h2 concentration h2 ion concentrations have a direct correlation
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:24.920]   to pH you know acid or alkaline and so what it really is as this chart can show you is that when
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:31.640]   you take a look at the pH level of of any type of concentration then you can take a look at the
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:37.800]   amount of hydrogen ions that are within that that solution and so or that food specifically food
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:46.040]   and so though what the h2 stands for this is a a micro mole per liter so if you start out really
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:51.320]   high I start out with a really high pH of seven well I'm not high that's actually you know our
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:26:01.400]   bodies run around seven and a half so we're at a 7.0 pH the micro moles per liter are 0.10 and then
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:07.080]   as you get lower and lower down the pH scale you get all the way down to like say three or something
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:14.760]   it's a thousand micro moles per liter okay so what that means is is that the lower the pH i.e the
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:22.360]   more acidic something is the higher the amount of hydrogen ion concentrations will be in that
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:28.840]   thing so really found well it was one of the funny things in the research was actually found a paper
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:38.840]   from 1919 okay 99 years ago there was people studying hydrogen ion concentrations in food
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.720]   and studying the pH of foods right and in relationship to that and that's that's amazing and that's
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:48.520]   how far back you know people have been studying this this kind of stuff and so I just grabbed you
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:55.000]   know their pH tab there you know link below obviously but I grabbed the the tab the tables in the in
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.280]   the document that kind of listed the different kinds of foods and what their pH's are so what
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:07.960]   you're looking for you're looking for things that have very very low pH because that means it's got
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:16.600]   more hydrogen so here you go you've got like um if you look at apple juice right uh 5.02 pH so
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.560]   it's it's it's acidic because balance is seven and a half so anything under seven and a half is
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:27.160]   acidic anything over it's an alkaline uh so you're right there that it just that obviously apples
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.960]   fall on the list but over here let's take a look at other stuff I mean lemons 2.2 I mean you know
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:37.320]   there's sour uh grapefruit oranges rhubarb strawberries all these things haven't on the acidic bent
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:43.160]   right and they have a high concentration of hydrogen so if you want to know how to eat it
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:48.200]   go for things that are sour and go for things that are acidic and don't eat too much by the way
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:54.440]   uh but that's what you want to eat if you want to consume more hydrogen now lastly absorb it
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:59.240]   this is my crazy idea I didn't find this anywhere it's just something that occurred to me because
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:06.360]   all the things that I've researched in my lifetime I actually did a really super deep dive on ozone
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:12.040]   therapy at one point and I actually own all of the equipment I can actually generate medical grade
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:17.160]   ozone I can do I have all these ozone generators waters and air and you name it so I really did a
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:23.320]   deep dive but part of ozone therapy is you know getting an ozone generator sitting in the tent
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:28.760]   it's oxygen therapy / ozone therapy and you sit in a tent right um and you just and you absorb it
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:35.160]   through your skin because why what's the biggest organ of your body it's your skin it's the biggest
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:41.400]   organ you own and so the best one of the best ways to take in anything is to absorb it just
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.320]   straight through your skin like doing a clay bath so I thought well hey you know this would
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:50.440]   actually be a fourth way if you really want it to in it I can't imagine me doing this but you know
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:55.720]   hey everybody is different right so honestly this tent right here costs six hundred ninety five
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:00.600]   dollars you'd have to buy the h2 you get a tank so you get onto your local gas pro or whatever
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.440]   that's what we call it here in Honolulu we have a thing called a gas pro and you go there any
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:10.440]   kind thing you want it's a gas the tank probably costs like 50 bucks fill it up who knows but you
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.920]   know the whole idea is you buy a tank hook it up to this thing get the tubing and just sit there
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:20.200]   with your little helmet and you sit and absorb it through your skin now obviously that would be the
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:27.400]   most absolutely inconvenient way to do it but it is absolutely feasible it is absolutely positive
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:34.360]   your spousal think you're crazy but you can do it so it is the fourth way to absorb more hydrogen
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:39.640]   into your body okay so there we go the four different ways to absorb hydrogen and how to take in more
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:45.160]   because it's good for you now so with that said first question always comes to mind when you're
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:51.560]   talking about this kind of stuff is which way is better so you know I just want to share this is
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:57.080]   really interesting stuff that I ran across I was taking a look at there's this site called the
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:02.840]   molecular hydrogen foundation and it's this org started by gentlemen right here his name is Tyler
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:07.400]   LeBaron and it's just fascinating if you're into hydrogen you want to learn more about hydrogen I
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:13.320]   mean anything about hydrogen from a scientific standpoint this is a go-to site and so I was
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:18.200]   looking at and watching one of the interviews he had done with a doctor Shigeeo Ota who had
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:26.840]   basically that this doctor's paper I think it was 2005 on hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:32.120]   he did a paper and the paper became really really famous and it really kind of kicked off this
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:38.280]   whole thing I got published in nature I guess scientific journal and it really kind of kicked
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:43.800]   off the big Japanese thing about hydrogen so he was kind of like that guy right on so anyway so
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:48.680]   Tyler's like interviewing them and this is a transcript right off of YouTube so it's not
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:54.120]   bad grammar it's what the transcript said it's copy and paste so what Tyler's doing in this video
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:31:01.560]   I've always obviously linkable in this video he specifically asked dr. Ota you know basically is
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.840]   the effect of drinking hydrogen water better than inhibition of hydrogen gas in your animal
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.080]   experiments and then he repeats his question you later found that actually drinking hydrogen
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:18.040]   rich water is more effective and dr. Ota says yes that's right and then he goes on to say it was
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:23.320]   really strange finding that he had that he had spent a lot of money for making the this is
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:29.720]   broken Japanese or broken English right for maker equipment for hydrogen gas but it was in vain
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:34.840]   and I lost a lot of money for research these are all quote-unquote exactly what he says in the in
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:39.960]   the interview so wow so there you go because I had the same question when I started this little
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:45.000]   journey of hydrogen which is you know should I put out the 2500 and buy the inhalation machine
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.320]   should I get the generator should I you know what do I you know I want to do this I want to
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:56.360]   do this especially I want to do this with C60 and wow this was a great fine because this guy is
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:02.600]   kind of like really the go-to guy and he flat out says right here in his interview that he had
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:07.800]   done that experiment he had done that study and it was a waste of money for him but I really want
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:15.880]   to quantify that that specific study he was doing when he ran into this situation was specific to
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:23.480]   antioxidants use in hydrogens as antioxidant um actually found that study it's in the links uh and
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:29.400]   so uh you know it's a very specific study so it didn't work for what he was looking for it's kind
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:34.280]   of like the C60 rat study they were doing a study to try to kill the rats and they didn't kill them
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:39.080]   they live for it and they figured they learn new stuff because of of what happened but that wasn't
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:45.720]   the purpose of their study so he wasn't really studying the specificity between gas and water
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.760]   but that's but that was kind of like a side effect of the of the of the specific study he was doing
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:56.440]   at the time so that doesn't mean that it's not good for you to inhale it's just that he had discovered
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:02.680]   that hydrogen water was better as an antioxidant than hydrogen gas okay so that's really important
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.600]   not good not bad this is all science right so this is just a really interesting
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:11.320]   data point I wanted to share that with you good stuff so then one other side note before I conclude
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:19.080]   another interview with Dr. Shigayo Ota with an unknown interviewer I was watching this and it was
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:25.640]   it was kind of like okay same stuff same stuff same stuff and then all of a sudden at the 7.52
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:31.240]   mark in the video he starts talking about a mice study and so for all you guys that are
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:35.800]   ruling into c60 you know when I hear that there's you know the rat study started that all that
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:42.040]   off right well here's here's a guy who did a mouse or mice study using h2 and what he found
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:47.080]   and you can go ahead and listen to this if you want to but he found he this was his findings in his
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:53.880]   study of h2 and mice and this is what's fascinating to me because of the c60 rat study and the issue
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:59.400]   of you know why does c60 and and and h2 works so well together right so that here it goes he
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:04.680]   basically says you know is that he discovered that that when he was feeding high fat diets to mice
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.920]   they would die a younger age than they're supposed to and then he would feed high fat diets to mice
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:13.560]   and then give them h2 and it prolonged their lives but what it did was it didn't make them
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:19.480]   live longer than their normal life like the c60 did the rats it just allowed them to live a normal
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:25.800]   life as measured against humans so that is a fascinating data point when you take that finding
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:32.760]   with h2 and mice and compare that finding with the c60 and rats you know it really starts to kind
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:38.520]   of like shed the light on on why these two things work so well together but it also kind of closes
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:44.360]   the window on wondering whether h2 has the same effect of c60 on life extension or actually c60
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:51.080]   in olive oil to be specific so a lot of really interesting stuff just a lot of fun i just loved
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.640]   learning and this is so cool to me so anyway i thought you would like to know that otherwise
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:59.320]   hey thank you thank you for stopping by thank you for listening to me thank you for my you know
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:04.360]   supporting my videos you guys are so kind i just really appreciate it i can't even tell you how
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.400]   much i appreciate when you guys say thanks uh you know it's a lot of work but i just really
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:16.440]   enjoy sharing and lastly before i i go i just want you to tell you that the next time that life
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:23.160]   gives you lemons eat them they're good for you they have hydrogen have a great day a lot
