[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me K. Omer and in this
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.440]   video I'd like to walk you through the updated C60 price guide for 2020. Now
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.480]   this started out back in 2017 where I started out shopping for C60 oil it was
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.680]   even before I even started making it myself and I only found about 7 maybe
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.620]   you know people that produce C60 oil and I just put together this list and I
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.720]   made some links and I made a video and I shared it with everybody I knew because
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.000]   I knew they were all looking for C60 oil too at the same time. I did it quarterly
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.560]   you know updating the price list kind of listing out who's selling it what are
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.080]   they selling it for what oils and all that and I did it quarterly for a while
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.440]   but last year it just got so big that I decided I'd only update the price guide
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.680]   once a year and this is the updated price guide for C60 in 2020. If you're
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.080]   interested in what the prices are what different types of oils are all the
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.600]   different new products that are out there that are C60 products then come
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.160]   along with me and let me walk you through it. So here's the updated pricing guide
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.440]   and of course there's gonna be a link in the video description for the PDF
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.240]   version of this spreadsheet so you can just go ahead and download it all of
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.200]   these are the links to these various merchants I've got them organized by
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.160]   country and also just really quick you know there's really no disclaimers on
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.160]   this video but I do want to put out that I do not endorse anyone on the list I
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.280]   don't sell any C60 oil I just make it for myself I started doing this to help
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.340]   people I think it's interesting and people enjoy it I don't have any
[00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.080]   affiliation with any of these folks I don't own shares or part I don't own
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.080]   anything that has to do with the list I don't endorse anybody I think they're
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.920]   all great and you know obviously there's no bias here I just made a pricing
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.800]   guide it's kind of like you know here's a shopping list of where you can get C6
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.440]   oil and and in what different types of oil so just want to make sure I put that
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.600]   out there for anyone who may be confused about that so okay so the last time I
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.480]   did an update was back in February 18 last year one year and one day ago today
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.880]   so this is the reason for the update today and so I just wanted to kind of
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.160]   walk you through it all right real quick this is the C16 oil now the way it
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.840]   originally started out was people pretty much I mean almost everybody only sold
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.840]   C60 in olive oil and then there was one place that sold it in avocado and
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.240]   MCT which is like an extracted grade of coconut or palm oil and so and so that
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.880]   was a very short list and so I kind of broke it up where you know I just have
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.280]   it basically here are all the original folks that sell olive oil and then they
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.360]   started adding on other oils over here and then I started breaking it out by
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.320]   country so you can understand the dollar amounts or the currency amounts and
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.680]   then there's a whole bunch of different countries here and then there's people
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.800]   that just never decided to sell olive oil and they started selling other oils
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   obviously there's a specialty C60 product section here where there's folks
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.920]   that sell other oils are not even listed up here lots of folks are selling
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.200]   capsules now last year only one place had capsules and then there's a spin a
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.880]   huge growth in topical which I covered in a separate video of course the folks
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.720]   that sell raw C60 and then some analytics here for the guys that sell C60 you're
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.840]   probably gonna be real interested to see where the price moving is so let me
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.680]   walk you through the columns this is the merchants by country as I mentioned
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.280]   here's the country they're in the currency that it relates to and then for
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.760]   the olive oil section pretty much folks go with this was my you know my my apples
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.480]   to apples comparison was that most places either sell their their smallest
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.640]   one is either a hundred milliliter bottle or a four ounce bottle which is
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.080]   like about 113 milliliters all right so I wanted to just to put the prices out
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.560]   there this is what showing on everybody's website as of yesterday and today this
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.200]   took a couple of days to do and so that's the prices now as of this date here
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.400]   okay 2020 all right now this this is a new section here called var which is for
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.440]   variance and so I put in here if the price had gone up or down since last
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.200]   year February okay so you can see where the dash is just mean there's been no
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.920]   change in price and you can see some folks have raised their prices and some
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.480]   folks have dropped their prices I thought that was interesting to share now the
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.080]   purity and the milligrams per milliliters still the same if it's available on the
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.320]   website and quote easy to find for me I will put down the purity of the C60 that
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.280]   they're using I mean it go it goes as low as 99.90 all the way up to 99.99 so
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.980]   you know really depends and you know it's not a huge difference and for those of
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.440]   you who don't know what that refers to as here McGivian existence an example
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:51.320]   99.90 purity means that the powder they used to make that C60 oil was 99.9% of
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:59.840]   the powder was C60 and 0.1 right 0.1 of the powder was another type of
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:07.000]   fullerene like C70 C84 etc it's just another fullerene in there and that's
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.720]   what that really means it's just well how much C60 was in was in the powder
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.440]   that they used and then of course the milligrams per milliliter that's the
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.160]   saturation rate you know the benchmark is 0.8 milligrams per milliliters was
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.880]   what you'll find in most commercial products and it gets as low as 0.71 and
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.840]   it goes as high as 1.0 and so it all depends on the product and you know the
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.480]   way people mix it's a little bit different some people can get a little
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.080]   bit more C60 in the oil some people get a little less and that's what the
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.720]   milligrams per milliliter it's not a huge difference right but if you're
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.040]   actually trying to like pinpoint and calculate down your your dosage to the
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.480]   to the milligram you need to kind of pay attention to this now here's the
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.760]   different oils that people will sell along with olive oil this up section up
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.680]   here it's everybody who sells C60 in olive oil and other oils okay so now I've
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.800]   got avocado MCT which is again medium chain triglycerides and it's derived
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.120]   from coconut oil or palm oil and then of course sunflower oil hemp oil not to be
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.000]   confused with CBD this is just regular old hemp oil pumpkin oil and then a
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.840]   miscellaneous one if there's a miscellaneous one I make a note right
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.080]   here under notes what type of oil that is so I'm not gonna walk you through the
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.360]   whole thing there's a lot of data here I just want to tell you how to read this
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.320]   thing and then you know but basically I've tried to as best I can because it is
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.760]   not really apples to apples here right because you got 100 milliliters and
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.640]   four ounces so but I did kind of it is sorted by by price so you can get the
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.600]   the most economical down here and the highest prices up here so they do get
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.640]   kind of pricey you get up into these folks up in here and it could be as high
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.080]   as a hundred dollars for that for their littlest bottle which is is pretty steep
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.040]   you know when you've got other folks out there that are selling anywhere from
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.520]   20 to 30 dollars so you know and of course you know you get what you pay
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.480]   for some of the you know I would say when you go shopping if you're if you're
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.520]   want to just try I mean I've tried at least a dozen different branches to just
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.080]   to try I just wanted to see what the differences were and you know some people
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.480]   really go all out on the quality of their olive oil and which is impressive and
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.600]   some people go you know they're just it's all over the map but usually it's
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.520]   the quality of the oil is the differentiating factor and the time and energy
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.880]   they put into it and things like that but there's a big swing I mean you're
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.560]   talking from hundred hundred dollars down to 20 bucks that's a huge price
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.000]   swing so if you're out there shopping here's your list click on any one of
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.800]   these read up read up about them on their websites now that here's the price
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.840]   swings now some of them have gone up pretty significantly like this vendor
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:48.120]   right there has raised their prices 15 bucks a bottle since last year I think
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.200]   you got another person here who dropped hers by a dollar 90 most people kept
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.280]   there the same okay and then how to read this over here is if you see a price
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.640]   in the column they sell that type of oil with C60 in it that's the price and
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.520]   then there's this one odd one where they don't sell anything in a hundred
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.000]   milliliters or four ounce bottle and their smallest bottle of this of these
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.760]   oils is 250 that's kind of how you read that okay so that's that I do want to
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.240]   point out that there is one you know it's kind of interesting honestly to see
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.480]   how people are marketing and how they're producing product and the different
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.240]   things they want to do to differentiate themselves in the market so I thought
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.680]   it was real interesting that that SES was out there selling just you know
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.200]   they're selling C60 in olive oil right for that price but then they actually
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.600]   have a like a higher grade olive oil right which I think is cool and so they
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.880]   got like a really really you know high quality grades olive oil and they of
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.600]   course it cost them more so and so they've got a it's the same size but they've
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.160]   got two types of C60 in olive oil and the and the and the one that's more
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.920]   expensive is the 6995 so I think that was that was pretty cool and then of
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.240]   course you've got carbon 60 plus which has a regular olive oil four ounce 27
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.400]   bucks but they also have an extra strength one for 44 in the four ounce
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.800]   bottle so it's kind of cool you know you got different people doing different
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.720]   things to try to differentiate the product from other folks then you get
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.400]   down in here in the UK market and all of the prices are in pound sterling tried
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   to arrange it by price most everybody's in the hundred milliliters some some
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.360]   prices went up some prices went down and some people sell more than just that
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.080]   one oil and you know and so forth so these are the different oils that people
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.160]   are selling the one thing that's interesting here is the C60 in olive oil
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.080]   company is really the only one that actually sells it as a bottle of oil in
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.600]   black seed I thought that was interesting and actually in a new one on the
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:42.360]   market now that it was not around last year which I thought was really cool is
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:48.760]   carbon 60 Evo in the UK is now selling C60 in sesame oil so I don't know if
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.640]   you've ever ever tasted sesame oil but I can't imagine taking a tablespoon of
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.080]   that that would be pretty well or black seed oil for that matter unless that
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.800]   stuff smells strong but you know it's great you guys are being creative kudos
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.040]   to you all right so then we get into the Australian Metro merchants you know
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.080]   obviously I'm gonna I'm only I only read and speak English so and so I am
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.640]   gravitating towards the English speaking ones that have websites I can read so
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.280]   if you have a website it's not in that my in my language I'm sorry you're not
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.920]   gonna be on the list but for the Australian merchants there's a I found
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.120]   five of them here's the five and the prices so far then and itself
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.760]   explanatory this one was only a little bit different they didn't have a hundred
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.760]   milliliter or four ounces was a 120 with their smallest one so you know
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.800]   apples and oranges but I try to you know try to do my best with listing them in
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.000]   the different oils that they offer so you know really if you're out there and
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.760]   you're in one of these countries you're looking for something different you
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.400]   know you're tired of olive oil you just want to bring you know you know try a
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.080]   different one there's some really great oils out there I mean especially the
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:49.880]   avocado is is my second favorite to all of MCT is awesome and I you know
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.000]   honestly I've never tried the pumpkin I you know that's something new I haven't
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.240]   tried that it's on the list and almond would be interesting to I'm actually
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:02.960]   trying to make a C60 walnut oil right now after I do the next I got like all
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.680]   these experiments lined up I got the two more experiments and I'm gonna try the
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.960]   walnut oil so anyway so here's your your aussies and then I just had a
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.680]   bunch I just went looking to see you know like what other countries out there
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:19.000]   out there haven't because when this all first started in the fall of 2017 there
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.820]   was only like I said around seven that you could find I scoured the internet
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.920]   only found about seven maybe nine at the most and so now I just kind of just
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.880]   went looking right on Google you know and I found a couple of sites in Mexico
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.520]   of course there's a red line for in Ireland there of course there's one in
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.240]   France the Switzerland one's been around for quite a while and so they were one
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.920]   of the original guys I mean they were on the market you know some guys in Canada
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.800]   New Zealand there's a new one out in New Zealand and of course Germany so you
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.840]   know so there's and you know this is all what in Hawaii we would call it
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.560]   kapakahi which is like which means kind of like all over the place so the prices
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.920]   are all over the place because they're all the different you know currencies
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.600]   right so there's real no apples to apples I just made a list by alphabetical I
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.480]   think maybe not anyway so you can click on any one of these go to their website
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.160]   and they sell C60 oil in all of these different countries in it I think that's
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.200]   great because that wasn't around three years ago so it's kind of cool that it's
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.000]   really spreading beyond the you know the English speaking countries now we get
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.640]   into the non olive oil merchants and these are just folks that sell 60 in oil but
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.480]   they don't have an olive oil product you know they don't have that flagship
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.720]   olive oil product so you've got people that are you know again you've got the
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.060]   apples you know MCT sun hemp and so you know these folks just sell the avo the
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:37.520]   MCT the hemp and then of course I know the sunflower here for C60 dashcom that's
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.960]   the Bob Grezka's company there and then they've got one here which is
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.520]   interesting which is a Mitra they sell MCT but then they also sell an MCT and
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.120]   black seed oil combination like it's a mixture and then of course there's a
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:54.080]   flax seed here you got this flax seed oil C60 and flax seed oil so that's kind
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.800]   of cool and so that's that's how you read that one other thing I want to point
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.400]   out is that this little yellow the yellow highlights is where where it was
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.280]   easy to spot okay now I didn't spend like an hour on each website reading
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.880]   every single page so you know I'd look at it look in the product section read
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.480]   the description to make sure I got my numbers right I got the price you know
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.160]   blah blah but you know but if it was really like out there that it was like
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.920]   hey this is a solvent free meaning not process with chemicals I mean because
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:26.600]   you know there's there's two ways you know three ways to process C60 from you
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:32.080]   know graphite and and and the lot of places call it solvent free but if they
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.280]   say the word solvent free the word solvent free and then somewhere in there
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.880]   they say they vacuum bake it and you know that's not solvent free they used
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:46.400]   solvents to process it and then put it in a vacuum so they quote got rid of it
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.000]   because they vacuumed oven did out for 24 hours and then rinsed it in ether
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.880]   or something which is the process and so then they say okay well then they
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.280]   test it and there's they don't see any solvent so they call it that's solvent
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.760]   free my definition of solvent free means it's been it's there's no solvents in
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.200]   there and and that kind of goes back to if you understand homeopathy and
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.400]   essences there's that whole science it's a real science about you know that
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.200]   dilution and you can literally dilute down to the molecule and even if there's
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.920]   one molecule left there's the frequency of that of that essence or that that
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.400]   element in in whatever is it left behind so it's kind of like the whole water
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.160]   with memory thing and so bottom line though I'm just trying to be real clear
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.880]   about what the word solvent free means and and it really means that it never
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.080]   touched chemicals and I only I only saw three there might be more if you're one
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.720]   of the ones that are more please let me know and I'll update a guide so that
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.520]   when people download it they have it and it's accurate I'm sorry if I didn't
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.560]   catch you I really do apologize I just this is all I could find was these three
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.880]   guys who basically were very clear that hey it never touched now this is the
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.160]   thing I either look for the word sublime or never touch chemicals right then
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.080]   pretty pretty clear there all right so that's that so now let's get into this
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.600]   specialty because that's the coolest part about this because you know people
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.320]   been making C60 off for a while now but the specialty products is where I get
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.040]   I'm a tinker so I love this I love to see what people are doing and they're
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.640]   tinkering I think that's so cool now the folks that are making other types of
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.040]   C60 oil primarily in it kind of falls into these categories where they have
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.880]   like this proprietary blend so it's not any one particular oil it's a blend but
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.520]   they don't say what the blend is or they have it in the ingredients list and
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.080]   you know and it's just kind of like all the different fatty acids and stuff so
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.320]   you've got the the iron Mitchell's company he produces the C60 plus but he
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:35.080]   also produces life pet and C360 health and so these two products here are a
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.760]   proprietary blend of oil and they come in different sizes and one is for dogs
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.080]   cats and horses and the other one is for men and or women they got like a man
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.000]   product and a woman product and so they've got also too they've got the the
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.600]   regular dog and cat product and horse product and then it also comes in an
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.600]   extra strength for I think like this is like 49 and it would be like 76 bucks
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.680]   for for the next strength up okay so and you know I just want to point out
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.640]   something too that there are a lot of other folks I don't I wouldn't say a lot
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.680]   of other I did run across maybe I think three or four other folks that were
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:11.200]   selling pet products and I didn't want to get it didn't didn't get into it you
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.040]   know this time around but you know yeah it's just folks that are basically
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.880]   taking like their C60 oil and putting a different label on it and calling it
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.440]   for pets which is totally cool I mean it's totally cool right but these guys
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.760]   actually produce something unique to pets it's a different blend than the one
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.800]   that they give to humans so I felt that that that earned its place on the list
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.680]   in terms of notoriety as a specialty C60 product all right then there's
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.200]   konanna carbon and you know there's still the only one out there there's
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.760]   that's selling C60 and CBD oil I've made two videos on this I don't understand
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.880]   why you producers out there don't go for this it is the coolest product I make
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.400]   it all the time and yeah so there's still only one guy that does it I don't
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.320]   understand maybe there's no market for it but I you know I mean I like it but
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.160]   it is really weird that three years down the road nobody does it yet except
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:06.960]   this guy but yeah so that's C60 in CBD oil vitality C60 is kind of a real
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.080]   interesting product it comes a little pump bottle and you spray it into your
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.320]   mouth like you know that like like mouthwash stuff you know and so it's 16
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.440]   999 for a 200 milligram pump bottle and so you know didn't even fit into this
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.440]   construct and then of course there's this other one that just says it's
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:26.680]   omega-3 I don't know what kind of oil that is it's omega-3 oil so that's that
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.840]   one so that's kind of the you know it's funky it's different it doesn't you
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.480]   know it's real hard to kind of structured into any type of categorization so I
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.320]   just put it down here as another oil capsules again last year there's only
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:42.360]   one place that sold you know any kind of capsulated C60 oil and that was
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.480]   live longer labs in black seed so now you've got three other players in the
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.840]   market and two of them are selling C60 oil in all of oil capsules on C60
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.720]   olive oil in capsules and then you've got live longer labs now that not only
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.920]   how do they have their black seed oil C60 capsulated product but they've now
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:05.160]   introduced a new C60 black seed oil with curcumin in capsules so they're really
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.840]   kind of going down the capsule route as opposed to making bottles of oil that
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.280]   you take with tablespoons so that's got a there's a that's a new product for
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.600]   them and then if you go to their website they're all about they're
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.760]   filing lots and lots and lots of patents about these different types of mixes
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.920]   and things so you know there they go so there are now there's four different
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.640]   places selling C60 in capsules C60 oil right now the topical one I did a whole
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.160]   separate video on this about I don't know two three videos ago so you know I
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.080]   actually did a you know you can see all that there and I there's a lot of the
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.700]   ones that I covered in the video is in I'll put the link in the video description
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.920]   for that video but if you want to know more about the C60 topical go take a
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.800]   look at that video but here's all the links here's all the prices and then the
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.000]   size and then what kind they everything from you know facial oil you know like
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.400]   C60 facial oil C60 anti moisturizer hyper moisturizer face creams body
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.280]   lotions you know all that stuff this one is I want to point this one this is
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:05.640]   another ion Mitchell product from Health C360 and it's he's got a hair a C60 hair
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:11.440]   grow growth serum so if any of you folks are looking at wanting to get some
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:16.120]   hair back check out this product it's kind of cool it's made with C60 also
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:21.160]   want to point out that there's this interesting one over here that's got the
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:27.240]   best price you can imagine which is free CCC Labs or Dave over at CCC Labs is
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:33.280]   makes a two ounce coconut scented moisturizing lotion that I talked about
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.520]   in the topical video and it just smells wonderful it's a little tiny bottle but
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.000]   the thing about it though is you get it for free and the way he's got his deal
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   structured is you get it free if you buy any one of his other C60 oil products
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.200]   and you know what you can't beat that price I really like that lotion you
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.040]   know if you're just out and you're looking for something to try that
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.840]   something new I think the C60 lab I think it's six different types of oils
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:01.000]   that they offer and you buy one you get the C60 Labs moisturizing lotion for
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.640]   free so that's pretty cool all right so then I want to just point out the next
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.600]   to last section here is the raw C60 section so these are all the folks that
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:16.480]   do offer I don't cover any Chinese companies I only cover basically the you
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.480]   know the the ones that are established and have been around then this list
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.920]   hasn't changed it hasn't changed for years and so it's this it's the stable of
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:30.040]   folks that sell raw C60 which is what you would use to make C60 oil and so
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:34.040]   you've got a listed here I tried to list it kind of by price two sections
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.480]   here it's for one gram so that's kind of your apples to apples comparison so
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.480]   for one gram it's either 99.95 purity remember what I mentioned a little earlier
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:46.360]   or 99.99 the variances that the price went up or down so there's been some
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.880]   pretty wild swings I mean look at Solaris I mean boy they really really
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.400]   dropped their prices and this was that big deal right at the end of 2018 early
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.840]   2019 where there was a shortage in the market and so you couldn't buy any C60
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.760]   for about six months and so you know and so the prices got really high you
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.480]   know because demand was outstripping supply but now we've seen those prices
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.880]   come down especially with Solaris some prices have gone up like with red
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.880]   lion and then you know pretty much some prices have just stayed the same but for
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.440]   the most part the prices are pretty pretty level and then and then you've
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.680]   got you know high to low so you've got you can right now if you wanted to make
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.360]   your own C60 oil you know it could be as low as a hundred dollars a gram or as
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:34.160]   high as 329.95 per gram so it can get pretty high and I just want to you know
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.640]   shout out to the C60 telegram chat group that we have for all the C60
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.400]   enthusiasts people that make it people that take it you got questions you want
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.480]   you want to learn more about C60 we have a chat group it's like that old
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:52.720]   fashion chat room thing going on on a website called telegram and we and
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.200]   after about I don't know two years ago we kind of formed a co-op you know
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.440]   cooperative and the and well actually one guy formed a co-op but if and you
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.640]   know he's a saint and so he goes out and he buys large large large quantities of
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:09.500]   C60 breaks them up sells it at absolutely no profit and and distributes it for
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.720]   people who just can't afford to buy C60 and so you know when the when the
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:18.360]   co-op buys quarterly and then they sell so right now you know there's a the
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.360]   co-op is selling C60 raw C60 as well so if you have any questions about that
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.440]   link in the bottom in the video description you can kind of jump in come
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.400]   to the chat come on in ask about that and we'll point you in the right direction
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:35.500]   kind of learn about how to buy raw C60 at very very affordable prices from the
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.000]   co-op okay but these are all the different vendors download this document
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.920]   click on any one of these links and it goes right to that website all right so
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:47.000]   now looking at analytics and this is for you sellers for you guys you know I've
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.160]   been tracking the prices and so you know I do this kind of research for
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.480]   living so anyway so the average thought what I did was back in 2017 I started
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.280]   tracking prices and so and my benchmark was a one ounce of C60 in olive oil
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.600]   just to track where the market prices were going and so what we've seen in the
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:08.640]   last three years in the C60 industry this is US olive oil okay back you know
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.760]   in the early days it was very inexpensive this was before we had that big you
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.800]   know C60 shortage and demand skyrocketed okay so the average price back in
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:24.840]   January 20 and 2018 was you know $12.74 per ounce and so then because of that
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.520]   shortage you know one year later in 2019 there was a 16.8% increase in
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.400]   average price of the one ounce of oil it popped all the way up to 1489 but
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.880]   what's really cool is we're now starting to see price stabilization and now it's
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.600]   only drop 3% so the prices are coming down a little bit there's more producers
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.680]   out in the market there's a stable supply of C60 it's only a 3% drop in
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:50.040]   retail price and now we're averaging of $14.48 per ounce of C60 olive oil
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:54.640]   okay so so there's some stabilization there this seems to be where the retail
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.880]   market's gonna hold obviously you know need a good five-year graph to kind of
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.320]   get an underlying you know bottom for your pricing model but this is pretty
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.320]   much this is a good sign that we've stabilized and for consumers as well it
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.320]   doesn't seem like it's gonna look there's no other reason unless of course you
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.960]   know the the whole thing going on in China right now just has you know huge
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.640]   issue with like you know the people that make C60 can't get graphite rods or
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.040]   some stuff like that but you know right now this is word stands for the last
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.880]   three years in terms of price progression now in terms of the biggest
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.520]   thing I like to always remind everybody because what do I do I am a tinker and I
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:34.200]   started this whole channel about making your own C60 oil and so you know I need

[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.440]   that's like in if you were in the US it would cost you 83 bucks or eighty three
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:52.080]   dollars sixty four cents as of today and so that's what you need in terms of
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.440]   equipment that's a one-time purchase and once you got it you got it now the
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.480]   supplies that you need now if you wanted to make one liter of C60 oil you only
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.560]   need two ingredients you need one liter of oil and you need one gram of powder
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.640]   and now you could go with 0.8 grams per powder you could go one gram per 1.2
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.840]   liters either way you're going to come up with a liter or more and that's kind
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.800]   of like this is just the generic formula and you end up with a little bit of
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:19.000]   leftover don't want to go there and this is not the maker video but okay you need
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.560]   oil you need C60 for the oil 24 bucks that's my favorite organic awesome
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:31.880]   olive oil is a little I buy this brand called Elora it's $24 a liter and then
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.720]   the $110 well that's what C60 is costing right now in the co-op right we
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:41.080]   just ran out of that one they got the $150 one but 110 bucks for C60 powder
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:45.200]   one gram in the C60 co-op of course I only buy from the co-op want to
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.960]   support our group so it's $134 in ingredients now if that's that makes a
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:56.640]   liter there's probably about what 33 or 35 sorry my mind I don't remember I
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:02.400]   know around their ounces per liter and what does that come down to well per
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.720]   ounce if you make it yourself it costs $3.96

[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.200]   he's got all these expenses and stuff you know but if you make it at home look
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:34.240]   how cheap it could be so you know it's it's not unattainable so it's something
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:41.520]   to think about so C60 CBD oil C60 olive oil $3.96 an ounce or 1440 average
