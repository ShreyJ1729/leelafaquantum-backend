[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and this
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.680]   video is another installment in the video series. Welcome to Lele Q, otherwise known as Lele Quantum
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.520]   Tech, where I'm going through the top frequently asked questions that are received in our customer
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.040]   support and service group on Telegram. And so I'm trying to just address all of the major things
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.400]   that people are asking and wondering about and questioning whether they're new, brand new to
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.480]   quantum energy and brand new to Lele, or they've been using it for a while, and they just want to
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.600]   kind of get more out of their investment. But this is the overall, you know, video series I'm trying
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.360]   to answer as many questions as as they come up, you know, in generalized fashion. So this video
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.320]   is for people who are interested in how to use Lele Quantum Tech for their business or their
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.440]   profession. Okay, so it has to do with work, you know, and basically how we make a living. So
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.720]   if this is you, if you are a owner, operator, manager, director, you run your own business,
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.120]   but if you're responsible for, you know, somehow running some kind of thing, and it can even be a
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.840]   nonprofit, but if you've got a team of people or you've got a business, then this is how you can
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.000]   leverage Lele Quantum Tech for that purpose. So let's jump right in. Now, very first thing that's
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.880]   really important to understand is that, you know, whether you choose to use the upgrade service,
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.760]   the quantum upgrade, or you choose to use a block, but these are the primary, you know,
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.760]   these are the two tools that are going to be applicable for business purposes. Okay,
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:36.240]   and what these two tools do is that they send quantum energy, they send that positive life force
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.640]   positive energy to any, any place on in the universe. Okay, so they can send the energy some
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.800]   place. And then they also can manifest these tools can manifest things, you know, like basically,
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.520]   just if you're familiar with the idea of manifesting, but if you want some to bring something into
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.560]   your world like prosperity, or you want to bring peace, happiness, calm, all that kind of stuff,
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.680]   then that's manifesting. And both of these tools can you can use these tools to do that. So you
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.640]   can use these tools to bring energy into your business, you can use these tools to manifest
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.480]   intentions for your business. And then the thing that's the difference, and this is the key difference
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.160]   here between the two, is that if you want to charge stuff, so if you have products, and we'll get into
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.240]   that later in the video, but if you want to charge your product, you want to embed products, right,
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.520]   with positive energy or frequency, you know, like, you know, the manifested intentions,
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.880]   if you want to place that into something, then you're going to need to use a block. And that is
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.360]   the only difference between the two as it relates to business. So just keep that in mind as we go
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.520]   along in the rest of the video. So now the first thing I want to kind of clarify is like, what is a
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.560]   business in the world of Leila quantum tech? And the thing about what is a business? Now this is
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.560]   specific to quantum upgrade. Because like I said, there's two ways to do it, you can use the service,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.800]   you could use the block. Now, if you're using the service, then they have things they call it,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.840]   you know, it's a subscription where you would sign up a particular entity to receive the energy and
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.840]   then receive frequency, you know, IE manifesting, right? So the idea though, in that world is what
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.480]   is a business? Well, the business by definition is like you are the one who controls it, you are the
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.600]   one responsible for it. So whether you're the owner, the manager, the director, all those kinds of
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.080]   things, you literally could work in a large corporation. But if you have a team of people,
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.800]   and you have a department, that's quote, your business, right, that department. So you wouldn't
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.360]   do the, you know, you wouldn't do the whole corporation, but you could do your business,
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.240]   you know, your area, what you are responsible for. So that could even be down to like, if you are
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.360]   the manager of a retail location, or you're a individual who's out there, you know, as like a
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.440]   plumber carpenter. But you know, if that's your business, then that's your thing. And if,
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.320]   again, you know, if you're an employee, but you are responsible, then that's your business, right?
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.720]   So that's the definition of business. It doesn't mean just, you know, just for people who run
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.080]   or own business entities. It's also for the rest of us in the world, who are employees of
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.880]   corporations and or businesses who are responsible for chunks of it. Okay, so that's what a business
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.080]   is. Now, as it relates to blocks, the definition of a business is whatever the name is, you know,
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.680]   that if it can be identified, right, like, like in my former life, I did multiple different things.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.880]   And one of the things I did was I got put on very large projects. And the project had a title.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.320]   And so, you know, one of the things was, as you can manifest for that project team,
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.240]   because it had an identifier. And that's what the, you know, that's just how quantum works.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.120]   That's how the quantum field works. It needs to have an identifier to just, you know,
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.320]   to distinguish you and your thing throughout the other quadrillion other things out there.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.520]   And so as long as it has a title and a location or some kind of, you know, marker that says,
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.640]   hey, this is that one, then you've got it going. So you could actually put your team's name down.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.440]   If your team has a, you know, or your project's team, or, you know, anything, even the subdivision,
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.880]   your building, you know, if you don't have an address, that kind of thing. So that's the idea,
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.640]   though, that it has to be identifiable for either one of these two services. But the idea that,
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.240]   you know, for quantum upgrade, it's a little bit more tricky because you have to enter and,
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.160]   you know, you have to enter in some data in the fields. Whereas with a block, you can kind of
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.720]   describe it on a piece of paper and put it in there and say, hey, this is what I want for this
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.840]   thing. So that's the main key there. Now in terms of also things that you need to know about,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.280]   if you're using Layla for business is that there's a difference in the subscriptions. So here's the
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:44.400]   thing that's the most important thing for businesses is that are you, do you want to send energy to
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.280]   the business entity itself? Like, because the business entity is, it's like, it's like, you know,
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.400]   it's it's its own entity. It files its own taxes, right? It has its own name. It has its own, you know,
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.800]   in court, you know, like, you know, original documents, like you'd have a birth certificate,
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.200]   it has articles of incorporation or whatever you did, right? It has a license. So it is its own
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.880]   entity. And so do you want to sort of survive that thing, you know, and send that energy and
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.960]   manifest for that it's, and it can have one location or a hundred locations, right? But it's an entity.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.760]   Now, and so that's the business subscription and then which is different than the U subscription.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.040]   And here's the point I'm trying to make is that if you are your business, then you don't need,
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.280]   and you know, in other words, if everything's driven off of you, if you're having a good week
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.080]   or a bad week, that's your business, like you are a sole proprietor, you're a small business,
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.480]   and you're the one that drives everything, well, then you might as well just get a U subscription
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.920]   because you are your business, if you understand what I'm saying, right? So you're doing like,
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:49.520]   you know, like basically DBA, right? You're doing business as and then as a name and,
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.200]   you know, you might as well just do yourself because how you perform, how you feel, how you do,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:02.000]   right? And how you are getting along with everything in the world is your business, right? Otherwise,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.160]   you know, you if you get the difference, right? So you either got a team of people or a big
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.960]   responsibility or, you know, or just you, you know, if it's just you, just get the huge subscription.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.000]   Okay, now the other thing obviously for businesses is that some businesses have a physical like most
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.480]   businesses, but you know, some businesses, most businesses have a physical location. So if you
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:29.520]   want a particular location to have, you know, the energy and you can manifest for that location,
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:35.200]   then you can get a location subscription for that. Now just remember now, a business subscription
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   has nothing to do with locations, right? It is the business entity, right? But a location subscription,
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:47.360]   if you have a particular location and you want that space to have, you know, positive energy and
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.160]   you want to manifest positive stuff for it, then you're going to want to get a location subscription.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.280]   This is for the upgrade service. Doesn't matter with the block. Now there's also this really cool
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.600]   thing. I do want to mention that after for every single subscription that you have on quantum
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.640]   upgrade, after six months and after, I'm sorry, after three months and then after nine months,
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:12.000]   you get a free location subscription automatically. So, you know, so if you're thinking about, oh,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.200]   I want to sign up some locations, we'll just get a, you know, get a business one and then wait
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.800]   and you'll get two free locations on top of that. So, you know, so I'm sorry, you'll get,
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.880]   yeah, you get two free locations on top of that. So that's kind of something you, you know,
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.600]   should be aware of, right? That if you sign up for a business, you will get two free location
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.800]   subscriptions after nine months. Okay, first one's at three, second one's at nine.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.000]   So that, you know, that's a perk of the quantum upgrade. Now, the other thing that, you know,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.840]   kind of falls under business is if you're in the business of having vehicles or boats or any kind
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.840]   of thing that moves, you can get a vehicle subscription and just for that thing, you know,
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.920]   that's your whole living like truck driving. So that's something to consider as well though. So,
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:57.200]   those are the kinds of subscriptions under upgrade that are applicable to businesses. Okay, now in
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.480]   terms of, you know, lay the cue for business using a block, well again, it's all about managing
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.880]   manifesting intentions. And so instead of filling out and signing up for a subscription,
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.400]   you would just purchase a block and then you would put whatever you want to do, you would just
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.520]   write it down and put it in that block. And then you basically, you know, do the man, you know,
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:22.320]   the intention thing to send energy, send intentions, send frequency using a block and the upgrade
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:29.120]   service is basically a large block, you know, virtual block. Okay, so that's how that works.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:35.520]   Now there are frequencies, you know, this is all about vibrational, you know, vibration and energy.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.960]   And if this is something that you're aware of, and you're, and you kind of bring it into your own
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:44.080]   life, and you want to apply it to your business, that's great. It works just the same way. There
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:49.280]   are frequencies for people, there are frequencies for plants and animals, and there's frequencies
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.520]   that work really well for businesses. And so the thing that I kind of want to point out that if
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.160]   the business frequencies, you know, obviously you're going to want to send that business entity,
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.040]   you know, you want to manifest for that. And that's kind of the thing where I kind of draw the line,
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.800]   that if you have a business or the location or a vehicle, then you're going to want to manifest
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.160]   something for that, you know, what do you want the vibe to be? That's really kind of what it
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:18.960]   comes down to. What do you want the vibe of that, of that entity or that location or that vehicle
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.760]   to be, you know, when you know you're using it, and it's being used for business purposes. So
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.720]   there are some frequencies that are available on Leila Quantum Tech
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:34.320]   for manifesting, you know, positive stuff for businesses. And so basically it's right there
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.640]   right here on the slide. So you've got the abundance, you can bring abundance into your
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.000]   business, gratitude, happiness, multi-dimensional protection. You know, if you've got like you're
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.600]   going through a bad streak and weird stuff's happening, you want to kind of clear the negative
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:53.680]   energy out, prosperity, you know, bring in prosperity for your business. And unity, unity is a great
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.640]   frequency for businesses. You know, if you've got issues with, you know, people getting along,
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.920]   and you just want everyone to kind of just, you know, get to, you know, just calm down and
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.840]   everyone get to, you know, so it's a really great one, just, you know, kind of bring everybody
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.000]   together, you know, unity, right? Gratitude, by the way, I really want to point out, gratitude
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.720]   is one of the biggest frequencies out there in terms of the strongest transformational frequencies
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.280]   out there. And just the whole, you know, the frequency of gratitude is such a powerful
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.680]   frequency. And to bring that gratitude into your business, you know, it's kind of like, hey,
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.440]   your customers are going to feel it, you know, they will. And so that's the idea here. You're
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:33.600]   going to be manifesting using manifesting frequencies for your business, your locations and your vehicle.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.240]   That's what I would recommend you do give it a try. Any one of these things, just, you know,
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.160]   just whatever your situation is, or whatever you want to bring in, any whatever you want your
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   business to vibe with, that's manifesting. Now, you've got people, right? You are one of the people,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.560]   and if you have other people, your employees, then you're going to, you know, then the option for
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:58.320]   businesses as relates to having people working for you is you could use some of the people frequencies.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.480]   And so let's say you have a location and you can just sign up the location and let's say you want
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.360]   to, you know, you want to manifest a vibe there, but also maybe you want to just, hey, I want to send
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.880]   that location a frequency that all of the people in it will feel. And so you can like, hey, you know,
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.440]   we have a real big project going on or a real important thing. I want everyone to be focused
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.600]   and getting, you know, and doing that kind of stuff. So you can send people focus, you know,
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:28.240]   people frequencies, which are physical and emotional and or even better if you, you know, for people
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.920]   with a block, you're unlimited, you know, you basically create all your own subscriptions,
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.560]   quote unquote, right? And so with a block, you can actually put people in, you know, people
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.280]   with me, you know, only one at a time, but you can put people in there. One at a time and send
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.320]   people, you know, whatever you want, so you can help them focus, you can help them heal. And heal
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.960]   is, you know, is a kind of a holistic experience, abundance and love. That's what that means is an
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.520]   acronym. But it helps the body heal. So if people are, you know, here's the thought, you know, like,
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:01.280]   I used to have many different lives. And one of my lives was I had a huge group of people
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:07.360]   that were entry level that I had to be responsible for. And we, you know, like two or three times a
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.600]   year, you know, I used to call it and, you know, the plague would come through the office, right?
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.640]   And you know, you'd lose like 10, 15% of your staffs out sick on any given day. And it's just like,
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.320]   this, you know, it just kind of goes around, right? And so then I, you know, back then it would have
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.880]   been wonderful to be able to have frequencies that I could just send to the location, right, on top
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.560]   of the other stuff that I was doing to try to keep everybody healthy. You know, but if you,
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.760]   you know, like, but that's the whole thing. You can send healing vibration,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.600]   you can send inner peace, if there's whatever strife or stress, you know, how, you know, life
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.520]   goes on, right? And people are stressed out, you can kind of, you know, just send inner peace to
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.320]   the location. Or if you have two or three specific, you know, individuals that are important to you,
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.280]   you know, you can actually target them with a U subscription, you can get them a subscription
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.160]   on quantum upgrade and send, you know, the all these positive energy and vibration to them.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.640]   Because, you know, let's say they're your star performer and you want them jacked and doing their
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.520]   thing. I would definitely if I had a small business or, you know, whatever, if I have a big business,
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.760]   but if I had, you know, and you know how it goes, right? 130, your staff carries you the other
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.400]   third floats and the other ones are like, you know, what, you know, and so the one third that
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.640]   really carries you that really makes the moves of the dial for your business, those people,
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.360]   I'd get them all a U subscription and I'd be pumping them full of, you know, healing energy
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:26.000]   and keeping them healthy and keeping them motivated, you know, do anything I could, right? For those
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.840]   people, I would make sure I took care of them. And if I had a block, I'd be doing the same thing,
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.480]   you know, with those people. So that's the idea, you know, is you could, you know, use the people
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:40.560]   frequencies are just as helpful for a business as the manifesting stuff for the business, right?
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.080]   And then the Olympic performance frequency is pretty cool. You know, if you've got something
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:50.000]   super important and it's going to, it creates a lot of physical effort using that for on people
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.320]   is really helpful for that people, you know, for those people that are doing that, right? So
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.520]   those are the kind of things I'd like you to, you know, think about is, you know, how do you use,
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.640]   you know, how do you use frequencies? How do you do manifesting? And, you know, and above all,
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.440]   you know, you can do with just the quantum upgrade and also just the block, you know,
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:14.400]   just sending them energy. You don't really always have to use frequencies, but just sending them
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:20.720]   energy, you know, and quantum energy is incredibly uplifting. And, and, and it's, it's, you know,
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:26.480]   it's basically chi, it's life force energy. And you're sending this incredible boost of positive
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.920]   energy into whatever you, you know, you put into the, into the block or whatever you sign up for this,
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:41.040]   you know, the quantum upgrade. And that positive energy just by itself has a remarkable effects
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.400]   on businesses and people and so forth. So you've got the energy going, and that's an automatic,
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.920]   and then of course, you know, you can use, and this is how you use frequencies. And the other
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.840]   thing I kind of want to just kind of give you some examples, okay? So like, you know, you're
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.800]   business and you're, or you're in charge of something. And you know, so here are some ideas on what I
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.240]   would do if I was in your shoes. And so here's some different industries. And I just kind of
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.200]   want to throw some ideas out at you. Now the very first thing, obviously, is if you have a product,
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.960]   whether your hosts or you're retailing it or your wholesaling it or whether you're manufacturing it,
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:19.200]   if you've got an actual product, the physical thing, then you might feel very compelled and
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.240]   consider charging it with positive energy. And let me give you the reason why I think that's a
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.840]   really great thing. And it's anything, any kind of doodad or whatever piece of equipment or you name
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.720]   it, right, appliance, whatever, you know, if you're selling a physical thing, here's the thing.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.560]   If you go into our telegram chat groups and you just kind of read, you know, like just, you know,
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.680]   just kind of follow it for a while. And there are like literally almost 10,000, 10,000 people,
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.040]   just kind of, you know, in there and just chatting with each other and talking about the products,
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:52.320]   asking tons of questions, getting some guidance, et cetera. But what I see, and I'm one of the
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:57.040]   moderators been with the, you know, been one of the admins since the day it started years ago.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.360]   And so I've read them all. And so what I see is I see all these people coming in.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:09.200]   And the majority of them, the majority of the people, when they're chatting about their experiences
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.920]   with quantum upgrade or Leila quantum tech, you know, they basically are they they report
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.520]   that they feel it they feel that positive vibe. And of course, there's all that science studies.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.760]   And if you're interested in that, there's just a ton of science studies that prove all this stuff.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.960]   But but I'm talking about the people who are reporting. And it's just I mean, it's hundreds of
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.920]   people just saying, yeah, you know, I got a capsule or I signed up for quantum upgrade,
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:40.000]   or I got a blog, and I I assembled that and wow, you know, and you just read this over and over and
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.400]   over. And so that is clearly an indication to moi that, hey, you know, there's people out there,
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:51.600]   a lot of people. And that's the people that are obviously attracted to Leila quantum tech.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.760]   But there's a lot of people who can feel that. So put that into perspective for your business
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:00.240]   for a second. All right, you know, let's say somebody's at a store and they're looking at
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:06.320]   different doohickeys or whatever. And they pick up yours, right? They're going to and if they're
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.560]   one of those feelers and the majority of your people are feelers, they're going to feel this
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:16.480]   positive vibe from this your thing, right? Whatever your thing is, it could be big, it could be small.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.440]   And then they pick up your competitors thing and it's not charged and they don't get that feeling.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.920]   Don't you think that would be a little bit of a, you know, a competitive edge that you would have
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.440]   this incredible, you know, you know, ability to give have your products give out a positive vibe
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:39.280]   at a quantum level, right? You know, so that's that just by itself to me would be the first thing
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:44.400]   I would do is I'd charge everything. And then of course, you know, if you're actually serving food
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.400]   and water and things that people ingest, if you're in the restaurant industry, food industry,
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:53.520]   you know, if you charge stuff, it actually makes it taste better. It just does. Give it a try.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.160]   You know, I'm really honestly one of the one of the running kind of like, you know, tests, you know,
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.440]   for people that kind of want to go, Hey, this is really work. I'm like, you know, my answer is,
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.960]   yeah, just charge, just take a bottle of wine, right? Pour two glasses charge one of the glasses and
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:13.040]   at your next party and have everybody taste test, you know, charged versus noncharged blind,
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.760]   nobody knows which one and then ask them to tell you which one tastes better. And it's always the
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.920]   charged one. And but and then of course, the joke is at the end is that, hey, that's the same bottle
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:28.480]   of wine. And there's no difference between the two except one was infused with positive energy.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.720]   And that's the one everybody always says tastes better. And that that's repeatable. You can replicate
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.360]   that that anytime you want. And so there's this whole thing about it just makes things better,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.240]   you know, and positive. And so, you know, you would definitely, if you're in business and you
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.400]   have a product, why wouldn't you want to differentiate your product from your competitors by having
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:51.600]   some of this positive energy, you know, chart infused into your product? Now, here's the thing,
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:58.240]   though, about using Leila Quantum Tech for products, okay, is that there's a commercial license that
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:04.160]   if you're using Leila Quantum Tech, and I'm not an employee of them, but this is what they do is
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:09.840]   they're saying, you know, they have a commercial license. If you're using a block in the production
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:17.360]   of your products, or as part of your product sales, right, then there's a commercial license
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.400]   that you need to kind of negotiate out with Leila because you're using them, right, for your own
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.720]   profits. So you need to just contact them and just talk to them about it. They're super friendly,
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:32.160]   and it's easy. Okay, so just talk with them and make sure you, and I won't go over the details of
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.080]   the license. That's not what this point of the video is, but I just want to point out that if
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.760]   you're using Leila Quantum Tech for the production or the sale of your products,
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:45.840]   then you need to have a commercial license. Okay, now, and that's the only time that that
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:52.400]   applies. Now, if you also have, let's say, one of your business applications is sales. Here's an
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:58.080]   example of what I would do. And you know, the very first thing, honestly, if I was a salesman,
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.320]   or if I was involved in any kind of thing where I needed to sell, even if I was, you know, a plumber,
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:08.000]   and I want to hand out my cards so people knew to call me, I would get a metal business card.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.440]   Just like, here's just an example. There are dozens of companies that make
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.640]   metal business cards just as much as they're paper business cards, but instead get it on a thin
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.920]   piece of metal and charge that metal. Just like you would, you know, and here's the same thought,
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.400]   right? If I had all my business cards and I charged my, I had a metal business card and I
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.960]   charged it, right, I charged all my cards and I hand that little piece of positive energy
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.520]   to somebody with my name and number on it, right? What's the difference between me
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:40.320]   handing them this thing that kind of gives them a positive vibe versus your competitor hands them
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.800]   a piece of paper that doesn't, that has nothing. It's just a piece of paper, but you're handing them
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.760]   something that's emitting a positive vibration. Now, you can't put energy into a piece of paper,
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:54.400]   I just won't hold it, right? But that metal will hold it. And that's why I think right off the bat,
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.200]   if you're a salesman, if you're a real estate agent or whatever, switch to metal cards and charge
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:03.280]   them. And that doesn't count as a product, by the way, so that you don't need a license for that,
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:08.080]   just go do it, okay? Trust me on this one. Now, so that's definitely something I would do for sales,
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.080]   you know, just that, you know, it differentiates you, right? And then other things too, in terms of
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:16.400]   like service industry, some ideas here. Again, you know, I mentioned if you're in the distribution
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.360]   business, if you're whether you're a delivery driver, you're a truck driver, or you have a fleet of
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.520]   utility vehicles, whatever, but you know, you can either sign them up for quantum upgrade,
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.000]   or you can charge them. And you can charge them by just taking a photo of them and putting it on a
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.720]   block. You know, and so the whole idea here is that wouldn't you want to have all of your equipment,
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.800]   you know, basically charge with positive energy so that while your employees are using them, hey,
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.520]   you know, you've got a very positive vibe. Plus, you know, if you're, if you're subscribing to these
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:48.480]   things that it does help for the EMF mitigation, if that's a concern to your employees and are you,
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:52.640]   right? So definitely, if you're in the distribution business, you know, and you're using vehicles,
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:57.840]   then, you know, literally quantum upgrades made meant for that for from the user, they have a car
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:03.760]   subscription, but the block, the blocks unlimited, you can put anything in a block. Okay, now here,
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.160]   if you're in education, I mean, this is, this is actual questions that have been asked by,
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.000]   by school teachers is like, hey, can I, you know, if I have a daycare, I kindergarten,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.080]   elementary school, whatever, you know, high school, and you know, the kids are just off the walk,
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.240]   right? You know, what can I do? Well, I just want to go, hey, just, you know, put a block in the room,
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.280]   and just really put a block in the room and put inner peace in there, the frequency,
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.160]   inner peace, or calm, and just, you know, calms everybody down, you know, it just sends out this
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.760]   vibe and everybody, you know, it's not going to work for everybody. It's not a, it's not a silver
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.960]   bullet, but it helps because it's all this positive calming energy and isn't that what you want
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:42.320]   the vibe of the room to be, right? And so in education, you've not only got people involved,
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:47.680]   you've got locations involved, so you can send that calming vibe to a location, you know, your
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:52.640]   classroom or your school, or your training facility at the same time, you've got your teachers that
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.640]   you want to kind of, you know, help out from a people standpoint, you've got the students and
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:01.600]   the participants, you want to help out from a focus day awake standpoint, you know, so there's
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.560]   this people location thing going on as I described. Now in the world of finance, exact same thing,
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.960]   if you're in banking or you're in credit unions or your financial, you know, advisors or whatever,
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:16.320]   you have an office and you have people, same thing, you'd want that vibe to be really positive
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.400]   in your location so that when people came in, you know, they'd feel this really wonderful vibe,
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.480]   it's kind of like going into a bakery and you smell and it smells so good, you feel so good,
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.080]   you know, at a bakery or if you ever walk into a health food store, they all smell the same for
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.800]   some reason, but it smells like health, you know, it's that whole idea, right? It's that, you know,
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.280]   you want that space to vibe with this great whatever, whatever energy you want abundance,
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.520]   probably in a prosperity, happiness, gratitude, you know, but people are going to feel it when
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:48.240]   they walk in and your people are going to feel it. Health care is a great use of quantum tools
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:53.600]   and it does not require a commercial license if you want to use the tools in your health care
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:59.280]   practice and that could be any kind of you're a veterinarian or if you're a human allopath or
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:04.480]   you're a naturopath, you know, you're you know, whatever, Reiki, you name it, if you're just a
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:09.600]   healer, you're this is super helpful. I mean, just take a look at all the all those studies about
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.640]   what the energy does, what the frequencies do for the human body, right, or the or the biology in
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:20.240]   general. So just as an example, you know, if I was a veterinarian, you know, because, you know,
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.840]   everybody brings in the animal and you put the animal on the little table or the or that stand,
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.960]   right, I would get a grand block and I'd put I put a plate of the grand block on block on each side
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:33.440]   of the room where the animals are standing while I'm doing the exam and just, you know, I just kind
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.160]   of just, you know, just kind of charged up, you know, and give them positive energy or, you know,
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:43.920]   hand up, you know, charged collars or just whatever I could do to help these animals. And but definitely
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:51.360]   I would totally incorporate putting animals in blocks. And and, you know, to to help the animals
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:56.000]   that I'm helping. Of course, that works with people. If you're running nursing homes or care
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.760]   facilities, you know, just it just having a block in that in that space with a healing frequency
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:07.600]   is going to be very beneficial to everybody in there. So, you know, it's literally meant for
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.920]   quantum healing. And this whole this whole thing is just it's it's perfect for that. Now, if you're
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.080]   in the world of legal, right, if you're illegal, if you're in the world of legal, especially if you
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.560]   have to if you actually have court cases, you know, and you're in court for whatever reason, but,
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.560]   you know, and any time you're doing legal, you've got long nights, you're writing briefs and,
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.240]   you know, you just look, it's a ton of paperwork. It's also, you know, you have to, you know,
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.640]   basically go and if you're if you're, you know, if you're a litigant, you have to appear in court
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:38.720]   and all that and it's so you're dealing with your team of paralegals and attorneys and they're
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.880]   and they're all basically stressing out all the time. And you want to keep them at peak performance,
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.640]   you know, you've got a couple of those, you don't really star performers. And like I said earlier,
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.520]   you'd want you'd want to juice them up with positive energy and some frequency. You want your,
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.920]   you know, you want to bring positive results, you could manifest positive results, you know,
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.720]   you could try, right? And, you know, you know, you know, so you positive, you know, you want positive
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:06.080]   results, you could put locations on the court that you're at, you could put locations on your
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:10.160]   attorney offices, you know, all that kind of stuff, but the legal profession, just because
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:15.680]   it doesn't have a tangible physical thing does not mean that this won't work for for your business
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.320]   model, you know, perfectly because it's people, it's all about people and you have locations,
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:25.280]   real estate, same thing, you know, for every open house that I was going to do in the real estate
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:32.000]   world that open house, not only, you know, I totally would have them metal card, but for that open
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.880]   house, I would have that thing signed up on a location subscription, right? Have it in my block
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:46.720]   for every open house and I would be just pumping in happiness as a manifesting happiness and love
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:52.320]   and all that juicy, warm, hippy stuff that you want them to feel the smell of cookies baking,
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.000]   you know, that thing. And so the one that people walk into that home and you're just got, you've
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.200]   got this vibe going in that property and people are even commercial, right, whatever you want to,
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.040]   there are people like member, the majority of people are reporting in the cell to telegram
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:09.760]   track groups that they're feeling it. So you got and if the average person can feel this energy
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.280]   whether they're whether they're conscious or not, they're going to walk into that home or that
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.400]   showing and it's like, wow, this house felt so different than the other one and, you know, honey,
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:24.080]   you know, you know, you know, so do that. Now, if you're in retail, I think I covered that pretty
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:28.320]   strongly in the travel business. Same thing, you know, if you're in the travel business,
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.720]   wouldn't you want your property? Whether it's your Airbnb or your run a hotel,
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:37.920]   wouldn't you want the vibe of that place? I mean, just automatically, you guys are awesome
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:42.560]   at creating a vibe, you know, you know, it's aesthetics and, you know, you've got all your artwork
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.040]   and, you know, that stuff, you know, curb appeal of your location and all of that stuff, you know,
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.960]   that's the whole point of, you know, travel. But, you know, what could you do to different
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:56.080]   yourself? Let's say there's a row of you guys down a beach or whatever, right? How do you differentiate
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:02.880]   your property from the other ones? Well, why don't you exude and just embed positive energy into
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:07.200]   your property? Wouldn't that be a great way to differentiate your property like somebody would
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:13.200]   differentiate, differentiate their product? Okay. So that's how you do it. Okay. So you can either
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.760]   again, I want to report you can either sign up subscriptions for quantum upgrade, or you can use
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:22.160]   a block, you're going to basically send positive energy, or you're going to manifest through different
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:28.400]   frequencies. But that's how you use Leila Quantum Tech for businesses. And you know what? People
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:33.360]   have been doing it for years now. There's been positive results. You should read some of the
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.680]   testimonies about people who uses for their business and what they report, you know, the
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.760]   positive stuff that happens afterwards. So there you go. Thank you for watching the video. I hope
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:47.040]   this was helpful. Prosperity and good luck to your business. I hope you prosper. And your business is
