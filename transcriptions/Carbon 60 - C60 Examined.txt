[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me, Camar, and in this video I'd
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.560]   like to share with you just a little bit of research that I did with C60 examined under
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.400]   a microscope.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.800]   After my solvent free video I had some nagging questions in my head and I decided to go out
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.520]   get a microscope, a fairly inexpensive one, and then take a look at some different C60
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.840]   samples to see what I could see.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.520]   So let's just jump in.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.040]   The first thing I really want to make a point about, especially in this video is where I'm
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.720]   coming from, okay, and so I just want to make sure everyone who watches this, you've got
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:49.080]   to know that I don't make or sell any C60 products, I don't endorse any products, I'm
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.720]   going to be 100% transparent with you because I want you to be very clear that I am coming
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.400]   from a position where I don't make or sell this, I don't endorse it, I don't represent
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.540]   it in any way, I don't have a stake in anybody's company, I'm just an independent armchair
[00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.640]   scientist type of person, I just really enjoy science, C60 has been something on my area
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.440]   of focus and interest for quite some time, and I don't get paid for this, so because what's
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.880]   going to come out of this video is going to be pretty interesting.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.240]   So anyway, I want to be really clear, I'm being very transparent in this video, I don't mean
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.360]   to rock the boat on anybody's stuff, I just want to be, just share, I'm just sharing what
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.400]   I'm learning and that's what I've been trying to do since my very first video was I wanted
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.920]   to learn more about C60 and I wanted to share it with everybody along the way.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.520]   So that's this video and it's just a little alarming what I found.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.040]   Okay, so now this material is for research purposes only, any statements that I make are
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.480]   my personal opinion and is not to be construed as absolute fact because everyone should do
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.480]   their own research.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.680]   So I'm going to tell you everything I did, be extremely transparent, hopefully I don't
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:17.880]   ruffle any feathers and everyone is completely free to repeat what I'm doing here, look
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.280]   for yourself, come up with your own opinions, it's not that expensive to do and go from
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.280]   there all right.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.760]   So I just want to say that this is just transparent, it's what I saw, I'm going to share it with
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.480]   you and then we can come in our own conclusions all right.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.960]   So this is actually a follow up to the video I made called Solvent Free and so in that video
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.320]   I'm just going to go real quick, you can take a look at it, of course all the links in
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.600]   the video description below.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:56.280]   So the whole idea is you know, is C60 Solvent Free and so in that video I just want to go
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.720]   real quick, I covered the issue on how is C60 synthesizers three different general ways
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.840]   and then when you run it through these things it produces a soot, okay and it's called full
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.760]   luring soot, it's also referred to as full right, then the people who make C60 then you
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.440]   have to you know there's a bunch of you know different types of carbon in that soot and
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.920]   they have to extract out you know the C60 from all the different C70, C84 etcetera and
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.520]   so there's all this stuff in there and it's just a big pile of soot and how do you get
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.140]   that one specific thing that you want which is your C60, you know obviously if you're
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.720]   going to try to get it out so there's two methods to get the C60 out of the soot and
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.760]   it could be anywhere you know like 1% of the soot could be C60, I've seen it as high
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.400]   as 13% so there's you know there is C60 in this pile of soot after you go through this
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.440]   process and then the methods that they use to get it out or to extract it from the soot
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.240]   is they uses a process called the solvent method and that's literally almost everyone
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:11.480]   uses this method and by using the solvent method they basically mix it with a solvent,
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.380]   benzene, toluene basically paint thinner you know kind of it smells like paint thinner
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.980]   and then that's what they use and they mix it together they heat it up and so forth and
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.020]   then there's this other extremely rare way which is called sublimation where they just
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.420]   pack it in the bottom of a tube and then they just heat it up I mean heat it up really
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:36.300]   hot and as the as the actual carbon just literally vaporizes it goes down the tube it cools off
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.840]   and depending on where in the tube it cools off that's where it collects based on the
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.760]   molecular dynamics of carbon so anyway I'm going to focus on this puppy right here because
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.820]   this right here the solvent method is the primary method by which C60 is extracted from
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.560]   fullerene soot slash fulle right okay so now using the solvent method they mix it with
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:08.040]   a chemical and depending on what carbon allotrope or you know what form of carbon C60 is a form
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.440]   of carbon called allotrope you know depending on what it'll turn different colors okay but
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.280]   it's the same like you know this is all the same solvent and it's just the different colors
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.740]   that it comes out based on on how they extract it so they know that hey if it's purple it's
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.940]   the C60's in there if they turns red they know that it's C70 and all of this is basically
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.940]   high performance liquid chromatography and that's how they basically you know extract
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.380]   it out they put it in a solvent it changes different colors and then they separate the
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.440]   different colors okay and so then they take all the purple and put it in one vat and
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.780]   all the red one and and so forth as they're able to they are able to basically divide
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.940]   it up by color so then the very last step really is how do you make it solvent free
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.740]   because you know obviously you've got this thing and you want to hopefully sell it to
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.660]   people who are going to put it in oil and drink it so oh my gosh you got to get the solvent
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:11.840]   out right so the steps there are pretty simple it's you take the C60 solvent mixture I mean
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.140]   you take this stuff right now you can't you can't use the C60 in this manner so then
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.500]   they heated up really hot only and you know until a powder remains so just try to imagine
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.380]   they boil it off basically and evaporates you know the solvent the paint thinner it's
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.460]   called toluene and then they take that powder off the bottom you know that's all that's
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:40.460]   left over after the solvent evaporates off they take the powder they wash it in ether
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.040]   which is less of a toxic chemical than the paint thinner obviously and then they take
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.400]   that ether mixture so now think about it right they've got C60 in a and it's been soaked
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.880]   in ether then they take that C60 ether mixture and they bake it in a in a vacuum oven you
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.640]   know and so because it's a vacuum you know it and it extracts out all you know anything
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.920]   that's going to come that's going to come out of that as you heat it up so and then
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.260]   they just bake it and they bake it really hot up to 450 500 degrees centigrade and it
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:22.180]   basically when they go to test it when they're done they don't see any solvents left over
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:28.080]   and then they declare it you know quote solvent free so now the the point of the last video
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:34.760]   on solvent free was that I had discovered a run across a weird word I run across a couple
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:43.040]   of of studies that basically went and studied the C60 powder that is produced by these manufacturers
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.840]   and one of the studies came out of a book called physics and chemistry of fullerenes
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:52.200]   and derivatives it's on the internet you go to page 48 and read this study and the basis
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:57.000]   of that study was simply that hey you know that this one group of scientists took a commercially
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.600]   available C60 powder that people are using in oils right at the time that they did it
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:09.200]   was it was a long time ago so you know at that time what was being produced is what
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.400]   they studied I want to be clear about that in today's time maybe ten years later I am
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.360]   not aware and I don't think anyone could claim that they're actually you know extracting
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.360]   it differently it's the same process to get it out of the set this using solvents has
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.400]   continually been the same process but if I am wrong then you know by all means right
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.680]   please correct me but the process that they use to create a commercial product back in
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:40.360]   the day that they did this study maybe ten years or so ago they bought commercial C60
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.880]   they put it in an oven and they baked it up and this is your vacuum oven process right
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.200]   here and so as they baked it they took pictures of it they were there examining it with all
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.680]   the different tools they had and then you know under 300 degrees you know they didn't
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:00.440]   see any any sign of toil and then what happened was was after they got past the point that
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.800]   the vacuum oven process would have covered so as they're doing this okay these guys
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.280]   then you know they do their thing they stopped they look at and they go hey nothing's there
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:14.480]   well they collaborated they you know a collaborator no sorry cooperated that statement basically
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.540]   by saying hey yeah we don't see nothing right here you know we don't see it either so
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.680]   hey everyone's good to go they package up and sell it okay but then what they did was
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.320]   they kept heating it though to see what would happen and so after it got past 500 and right
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:34.340]   around in here around right at the point where these vacuum oven processes stopped and if
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:40.000]   you just keep going then that's when these scientists had discovered that there was toiline
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.160]   in the C60 and there was also benzene in it and that these substances were present present
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:53.700]   in the the sample and they peaked around 600 for toiline around 700 for and benzene and
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:59.360]   so forth and then after 650 you know the C60 changed into a form that became insoluble
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:05.800]   and useless so what was interesting about this was that they kind of found out that this
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:11.520]   process works only if you live in this world but if you keep heating it you didn't get
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.120]   it all out because you didn't keep heating it and so you really should be heating it
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.360]   up to 650 I'm not sure if people are doing that today but since the study came out but
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:28.920]   what this study did prove is that doing all of this does not get the solvents out and
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.520]   there is a such a thing as residual solvents and that was just that one study on that one
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.880]   sample 10 plus years ago and so I just want to make sure everyone's level said that it
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.240]   was just you know you know that was a study if a scientist finds something that doesn't
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.080]   mean that it's that's the answer to you know that's the the situation across the entire
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.800]   enterprise you know and across the entire industry it's just that one sample that one
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.280]   scientist group so then I you know I like I said I ran across a second study and this
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:02.320]   one was done 10 years ago right 1990 actually 20 years ago and this was done by the American
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.120]   Chemical Society at the same time roughly at the same time that other one was done I
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.960]   think the other one was on like 2006 maybe but anyway it was a while ago and so this study
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:19.960]   actually took a look at commercial C60 okay processed via this the solvent method using
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.640]   the extractors and things like that using solvents and so this other study and this
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:30.520]   is what was really nagging at me and this is why I'm doing this video this study you
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:35.960]   know links below and then this study was basically you know they looked at it and they determined
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:45.080]   from a I guess a molecular science standpoint you know be the way that atoms attached to
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.440]   each other and the way that those and they form molecules and how those molecules then
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:58.280]   form clusters and and and how they crystallize and then all of the different ways that basically
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.080]   you know at the subatomic part of I'm sorry not the subatomic but the at the atomic particle
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.760]   level and molecular level how things kind of work you know and and they looked at that
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:14.040]   and then what they found out by studying a commercial C60 powder was that the first
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.520]   bullet that prolonged vacuum this is caught right out of the study prolonged vacuum heating
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:25.760]   of the sample samples fail to remove completely the solvent molecules from Fulurite and that
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.240]   Fulurite is the same as Fulurine so it's somewhat okay so they just they found out that
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.600]   hey you know what you do all this stuff and they were trying to tell obviously they were
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:41.680]   doing a study to see if this process was as it was as thorough as necessary to claim
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.720]   something is solvent free you know the C60 is solvent free and so they went through it
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.880]   and they went hey you know they they this is a result of their study was just heating
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:13:00.840]   it in a vacuum for a long time does not remove the completely remove the solvent molecules
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:07.080]   okay because even though you test it right here and you don't see any right here this
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:11.480]   these guys prove that it's still there then these guys also then said yeah it's still
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:17.440]   there and this is what they they basically made the assumption based on on what they
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:23.040]   knew at the time which was under prolonged heating there's a possibility for micro crystals
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:30.120]   to be centered okay in this case some of them solvent molecules can be entrapped into cavities
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:36.200]   inside the centered micro crystals and they meant of C60 and if they further stated it
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:43.200]   in their and their conclusion this may be the reason solvents cannot be completely removed
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:50.440]   by vacuum heating of samples of C60 and only sublimation makes it possible to obtain virtually
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:55.920]   solvent free materials and so that's where we go back up here again and bottom line is
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:01.560]   that study said look you can't get it all out of of of you can't get the solvent out
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:06.480]   if you use it to extract C60 use because if you add the solvent there's no way to get
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.520]   it all out when you heat it up the solvent molecules will get trapped within the clusters
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:17.040]   of C60 in the crystalline structure as the carbon you know coalesces on upon itself and
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:22.280]   forms clusters and only this way was doing it because if you do it this way sublimation
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.880]   there's just no solvent use and that's what they said and so it kind of was nagging at
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:33.720]   me so this is what I decided to do was I just did this little simple little there wasn't
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.920]   even an experiment it was just a little I guess you know an examination I guess we'll
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:46.400]   call it that and so I examined some samples of C60 to see what I could see and traditional
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:52.640]   calmer fashion I'm sharing with you so here we go the materials and methods of my examination
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:59.320]   consists of I went and purchased this op this opti tech scope digital USB microphone camera
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:05.520]   microscope camera and it had a high definition up to 200 X okay so what I what I'm able to
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:13.080]   do is I'm able using this device is to look at anything from the top down okay and it's
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.200]   there's two types of microscopes one the light shines up from underneath it and you look through
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.640]   it and that's usually for stuff like blood and stuff you know virus and things like that
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.360]   but you need this other one that the light shines down on it because you know this stuff
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:33.820]   is solid right and so I got this little guy right here I bought this I obtained five different
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:39.840]   C60 samples from different sources I used a white card stock which is just the back of
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:45.840]   my business cards and then I just have this little tiny little lab spatulas these little
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:51.080]   tiny stainless steel spatulas that you can use to you know to move in and and work with
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.880]   samples little tiny samples of stuff and that was it I'll show you a picture of what it
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.560]   all looks like unfortunately I didn't I'm having problems with my camera and I can't
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.960]   show the video of me doing this so but it's pretty step it's this is this you know so like
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:10.200]   I'm just gonna skip it because it's so simple it's I put a little little itty-bitty spec of
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:15.440]   a C60 sample on the back of a business card I took a picture so the picture the first picture
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:23.440]   you see will be C60 on it on it on the back of a business card at 200x microscopic view
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:28.200]   okay and then the second picture is when I took the spatula it's like a so it's a little
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.600]   tiny spatula little stainless steel spatula and I just pressed down on the sample and then
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:40.960]   smeared it okay that's it and then I took a look at the smear because this was the thinking
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:49.360]   if these guys said that solvents get trapped inside the crystals okay of C60 because you
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:55.200]   know C60 isn't individual molecules like you don't well there's this one product that
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   looks like that but but you know it's not it is you can't just buy like a little vial of
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.440]   individual molecules because carbon doesn't work that way most stuff doesn't work that
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:09.000]   way I mean carbon like anything else it has an electrical you know attraction to itself
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.600]   and so it's going to stick to each other so everything sticks to each other and then what
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:18.040]   you see by the naked eye are the clusters right I mean just try to imagine that that
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:24.600]   you know for C60 the molecule is one nanometer and put that in perspective you line up you
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:33.060]   take C60 molecules and you make a line of them it would take 100,000 C60 molecules to
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:39.240]   span the width of the average human hair that's how small it is so if you can see it you're
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:45.220]   looking at gigantic clusters of it at a molecular level I mean we're talking just millions
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:50.560]   and millions of molecules stuck together just so you can see a tiny edd grain of it okay
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:58.420]   so that's keeping that in mind so so I figured well if I just smear it and crush those you
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:06.160]   know crush the the crystals just smear it onto on the back of something white you know
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:12.160]   maybe I could see something and and that's what I did so let's start the very first sample
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:20.560]   is a 99.95% purity C60 from SES research it was acquired I'd say about six months ago
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.040]   before they started putting out a browner product this was there probably the last few
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.700]   runs of their black product and so on the left side you'll see a picture of what it looks
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.400]   like and and this is the thing that I discovered because I just want to you know disclaimer
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:41.000]   here I'm just a regular guy who bought a microscope so I had a lot of challenges using this puppy
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.920]   because I didn't think about it from the standpoint of it's like you're using a satellite and
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:51.080]   you're trying to look down on a mountain and so this right here is like the tip of the
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.920]   mountain but you know because it's a little pile of powder you can't see you know it's
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.000]   like the way the camera focuses you can see what's closest you can't see what's far away
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.680]   and that's why these pictures are all fuzzy so you know so that's kind of how this worked
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.320]   out and I learned this as I was going and I had to do a lot of you know dinking around
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.600]   to get that to get as good as pictures as I could that's why I'm encouraging anyone
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.400]   else that that is interested please you know you know do it yourself and and see what you
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:22.880]   can see so this is the best picture I could get at 200x using the optoscope and you can
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:28.720]   see this is it this is what it looks like this is what the C60 looks like it was a little
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:33.160]   grayer than I thought it was gonna be and then there's some some brownish in here now this
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:40.480]   was pretty brown see SES cuz SES most recently their product started coming out brown as
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.840]   opposed to black and I'd actually emailed Chris Bruce and and I said you know why is it brown
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:49.960]   and he said because they are now pulverizing it and so they're making a finer particulate
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:56.200]   size product and basically per him the finer the product the more brown that it is and so
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.920]   I'm like okay cool so but so this is what it looked like just just sitting there on the
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:07.320]   card and then I smeared it and then this is the smear so you can see that there's you
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.800]   can see that there's there remains some black in here and then you all can see this there's
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:19.560]   this amber colored particulates and then there's also brown particulates in here so I'm gonna
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:24.440]   blow this puppy up so you can see it just a little bit closer it's a little difficult
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:31.800]   here whoop little difficult and there you go so this is what I found inside the SES sample
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:37.320]   and what was interesting was that you can definitely see black which is obviously the
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.920]   color of carbon the brown which would be the you know the finer particulates of carbon you
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:47.640]   can see the brown up here the black right here right and then you can see but this is the other
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:53.320]   thing all these little yellow crystals little yellow crystals all over and so that's kind
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.560]   of what I found in the SES one and I'm not here to say what these are because
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.920]   I have no way to tell you what it is I want to make that so clear I don't know what all of
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:09.320]   these different things in here are it supposedly solvent-free C60 but this is what's in it when
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:16.200]   you squish it and and you smeared across the card okay so that's that picture and the next one
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:23.800]   is a as an undisclosed source but it was 99.95% C60 validated by Solaris and this was actually
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:30.760]   came out of the first batch of bulk C60 that the telegram C60 chat group co-op acquired
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:36.360]   and the reason I don't that it was the source was undisclosed was quite simply the
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.640]   individual that was able to get us such a good price on it which was I think one 120 a gram
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:47.560]   they didn't want to disclose their source because they had basically cultivated the source and they
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.800]   didn't want to kind of like didn't want to give it away and have to share the source with people
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:57.560]   so and I respect that and so but but you know we did you know like anyone else we're like okay
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:03.560]   well is it really real and so samples were sent to Solaris and Solaris verified it with
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:10.920]   HPLC that this is C60 so that's why it's an undisclosed source but it was 99.95% C60
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:16.440]   validated by Solaris and so here's what it looks like it's very brown it's and it looks like it's
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.240]   you know it's what's really interesting is that they all look different now this one it's really
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:28.680]   really really brown and and but it just and it looks really like way more granular than the
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:36.440]   the ses sample but then when smeared it was like really really really full of these again
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:44.520]   you can see the sample of this inside the smeared you can see all of this of this
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:49.560]   yellow crystals you could see the the brown and of course you could see the black but
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:54.120]   if you take a look you know at these like if I could you know it's hard to do side by side but
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:23:00.920]   it's almost as if this one has it even more so the yellow stuff in it than than the ses sample so
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:07.400]   that that's sorry that's that's what that looked like now sample three is the MTR and and so
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:14.280]   they are one of the few along with I think sigma Aldrich where you can get samples of sublime so
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:21.240]   they they they advertise this as sublime and so under a microscope you know you look at the
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:28.520]   absolute utter difference in how this this C60 product look it comes out as little
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:33.960]   like BBs little pebbles and that was really interesting to see that C60 because it was like
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:40.040]   wow that really looks really cool and then but when I smeared it and I smushed it then this is
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:47.960]   what it comes out to looking like so this was the what they what they what they is claimed to be
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:56.360]   and advertised as sublime so what's really interesting here is that there's a lot more black
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:05.480]   clearly but then there is still these amber colored crystals within the sample and so
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:11.320]   you know you can start to form some some conclusions or not at least not conclusions but
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.960]   some opinions about like what is that stuff you know because but then you look like okay
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:22.920]   I'm sorry right over here in this corner in this I noticed that you know it was like that that
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.000]   looks like just all carbon right that is all carbon it's like one of those little pebbles
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.880]   got crushed and there was like there was nothing in it but here's the point about my whole you know
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.680]   examination was when you crush these little crystals or these little pebbles or whatever
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:41.800]   you're looking at you know there's stuff inside of them that's my whole point right here there is
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:51.320]   stuff inside of these and it's this yellow brownish amber colored crystals okay so that's
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:56.520]   that sample let me try to get back to okay so that's what that looked like and then
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:02.520]   now the next sample sample number four and you know you might find this interesting but Bob
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:09.560]   Gresco was actually very very gracious enough to give me an actual sample of the of his powdered
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:15.960]   C60 I wanted to include it in this examination because you know quite frankly you know it's a
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:22.520]   little his his product has been looked at you know quite negatively by a couple of his competitors
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:26.120]   so I decided well let's take a look at it as part of this sample because I'm going to compare
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:31.800]   them all why not and surprisingly he gave me a very small sample of his powder because you
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:39.240]   can't get his powder you just can't get it he only sells you know C60 in with sunflower oil right
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:47.320]   so so I got some of his powder so I could you know kind of do your comparison here and then
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:52.760]   under a microscope the powder just looks kind of like car it just you know I mean when you look at
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.520]   it what do you think the first thing I think of is it looks exactly like I would think when you
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.640]   said carbon you know it's just clusters of black stuff and so you can see little tiny
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.520]   itty-bitty pieces and easy big giant you know crystal size and then when I smeared it this is
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:14.360]   what it looks like okay so in when I'm smearing it there is nothing else in there and you remember
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:19.720]   now everyone says you know they're all all five manufacturers are saying there's our solvent
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:24.680]   solvent free but here you go here you here you have a product that says hey it's solvent free
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:30.280]   and there's nothing but the white is the you know the business card and the black is obviously
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.920]   carbon so this was really surprising because I did these in order and so when I got to this
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.880]   one I was like whoa there is nothing in here there really really isn't anything it's just
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:44.520]   black so that you know and all of these are data points put them together connect the dots
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:50.200]   however you wish you know this is um this is all you know basically I'm just sharing what I found
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:57.640]   but yeah I thought this was amazing that there is just just carbon it looks like carbon it's carbon
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:03.000]   right and so and there's nothing else in there there's no other color there's no other crystals
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.840]   and there's no crystals at all it's just carbon right so and so here you go that was that was
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.680]   interesting I'm sure there's no tiny EDB-D mic you know at 200x you really can't get into it
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:17.400]   okay so the fourth uh I'm sorry the fifth sample is a sample from red line and this is
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:24.440]   the red the red line um their newest uh c60 a year ago they were outsourced they were outsourced
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.760]   where they would buy a third-party product pulverize it and sell it and make oil with it
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:36.040]   and then this year they are actually producing their own c60 in there in their on their plant
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:42.440]   and then they're taking that and pulverizing it and um making product with it so now it comes
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:50.040]   in ethanol okay that's the 200 proof alcohol it's the kind you drink um and so it basically be like
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:54.600]   200 proof vodka or something like that ever clear you name it but that's what it comes in
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.240]   and so you know because one of the tricky things about this product here and this product here so
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:06.120]   you've got the grasca c60 and the red line c60 is both of these two as opposed to the other three
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:12.760]   not only do they advertise that they're solvent-free that's the new puppy not only do they advertise
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:19.400]   that it's solvent-free but they also advertise that they sell it in a mono molecular form and meaning
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:26.840]   that the particulate size is way smaller than uh then you would normally get in a commercial
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:32.360]   grade c60 powder in other words it's pulverized it's crushed and then it's very very small
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:39.800]   so uh and and so how grasca sells his product he sells it basically you know suspended in sunflower
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:46.760]   oil and then how red lion sells their mono molecular pulverized c60 they sell it in ethanol then you
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:51.880]   you know i have videos about what to do with it so so now what i did was is now when you when you
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:57.320]   get the when you buy it you get this big syringe and this little tiny black cap that seals off the
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:01.960]   tip of it and so this is how i you know because how are you gonna do this right it's not a powder
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:07.880]   it's a liquid so i took the cap off and there was just a little bit of residual c60 you know
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:13.160]   there was some c60 on the on the end of the cap and i just put that down onto the business card
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.240]   okay that's what i did and i just rubbed it off on the business card and then i put the cap back
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:26.440]   on the syringe and so this is what the c60 looked like uh at 200x um it's really black there's a
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:31.960]   lot of little white shiny things in here um you know you can just see them and then under a microscope
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:38.520]   uh this is i'm sorry after i smeared it this is what it looks like and so again i i want to point
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:43.480]   out if you and you i'm sure you immediately notice that there's no other colors in here
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:49.560]   it is just black but then you can see all of these little crystals and and so you know i don't
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:54.840]   want to start trying to guess what these other things are when you look at all of these different
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:02.280]   samples but this is what uh is sold as solvent-free and it comes in alcohol and and that's what it
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:07.800]   looks like when you smear it there is there's no yellow there's just these little tiny white clear
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:12.760]   crystals like like they look like sugar uh okay and that's what the inside of that one
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:18.680]   so this and this is what it looks like um i took this picture because i a lot you know i can't get
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:25.880]   the video out and so um whoops sorry about that i'm trying to refocus here so this is what the
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:32.520]   five samples look like i put the sample here smeared it took a picture before i smeared it
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:37.240]   smeared it took a picture you know um and then i went to this one this came out of the co-op
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:42.840]   mtr sample the the gresca sample and then the the red lion sample so this is what the back of the
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:49.800]   business cards look like when i was done and that and how i got the pictures using my little usb
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:58.120]   camera so that's what i wanted to share i think that it's uh interesting i think that it will help
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:03.400]   you uh you know understand a little bit better about what's going on when it comes to solvent-free
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:09.160]   and so i just want to let's just discuss it for a minute a minute again i want to point out
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:16.520]   that all of these samples uh were sold are being sold as as solvent-free there's clearly
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:25.560]   other particulates other types of material in four of the five samples clearly okay so there's
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:31.080]   something else in there with the black and you know carbon it's black okay and so there's something
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:39.400]   else in there in four of the five samples and the thing that was most interesting was that the
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:48.360]   samples that are sold or as prepared and then sold as monomolecular didn't have any of the yellow
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:55.400]   coloration the red lion sample having a coloration or you know let's just say it's another type of
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:32:00.360]   particulate right and it has a different particulate in there than the other four and it's the only
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:05.880]   one obviously processed with alcohol so there's an assumption there that you know that maybe
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.200]   right so i just kind of want to point out that three of the four
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:20.200]   are produced with uh actually i'm sorry these two are produced with toluene or benzene or something
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:26.200]   um and there's there's something else in there and it's this coloration this one is advertised
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:34.360]   as sublime but it's still there so question mark question mark is it really sublime
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:39.560]   because it looks kind of like that so that's interesting um then of course you've got this one
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:45.480]   which is just there's nothing else there but black then there's this one here where there's black
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:50.600]   nothing else no no yellow amber anything and then but you've got those clear crystals so
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:55.400]   you know it's interesting when you start comparing and and you're looking at these things and they
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:00.440]   look different and they're not supposed to look different you know and then what else is that and
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:06.280]   what in other words what is that stuff in there so i you know i like i just really want to be clear
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:11.080]   that there's no way i could tell i you know i'm just a regular joe i just could buy a you know
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:16.120]   a ninety dollar camera and take some pictures and share it with you i were at this point right here
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:21.320]   i'm right here hey man uh you know if there's any like real scientists out there who have access
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   to a lab could you please for the community for all of the thousands of people who are taking this
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:32.040]   thinking that they're going to get healthy can you please please please please test that that
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:37.160]   yellow stuff test that clear stuff what is it i mean because i can just see it you can just see
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:41.880]   it now i just shared it with you but what is it you know and and uh you know people are ingesting
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:48.600]   this stuff and we are the human experiment you know this is um all not FDA approved stuff it's
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:54.360]   it's just you know i'm just concerned because it's out there and and i want to know more but i can't
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:34:01.240]   now that was at a 200x 200 magnification and that's kind of where i stop i just want you all
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:07.240]   know that's where i stop looking at this stuff i looked into getting microscopes to get me higher
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:12.680]   power magnification so i could look really closely at those crystals you know get get closer to them
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:19.800]   and um the next one up is like $700 and that's just the microscope doesn't even come with the
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:24.920]   camera there's just no way i can afford that and i also don't have any access to or enough money
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:30.520]   to run all this stuff to to a lab to see if they could test it and see what that amber colored
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.600]   stuff and the crystal stuff is so you know i just want to say that's as much as i could do
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:41.560]   being an armchair uh you know scientist guy and and so but that's what i can do so it's kind of like
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:50.200]   where you know where there's a possibility for further exploration then there definitely should
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:56.520]   be more exploration and i i should hope that um you know access uh people who have access to labs
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:01.320]   can take this to the next step okay please because there's definitely something there
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:06.440]   there's definitely it's definitely not c60 it's not that's not carbon it's different color
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:12.360]   and so what is it and is it harmful to everybody so now i really now with that said okay keep this
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:20.360]   in mind that you know c60 has been studied a lot in terms of its toxicity so that means these
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:25.560]   products here this stuff this right here this you know these products have been on the market for
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:30.360]   quite some time and they've been used and study after study after study after study and then the
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:34.680]   study says hey there's no there's no toxic damage you know the whole rat study thing was about
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:40.120]   trying to kill some rats with c60 and they live twice as long so you know the studies show
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:45.720]   that even taking it in this form you know where you've got this this yellow stuff in it uh you know
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:50.760]   is not toxic and then if you read and and i've you know i've read a lot of these and if you read
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:55.160]   the studies that say that there's no toxicity uh you know that you look for exactly you know like
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:36:00.760]   what did they look at to make that declaration well they've said that there's no tumors in the mice
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:05.960]   the rats the zebrafish and all that kind of stuff that they use uh there's and they didn't see any
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:10.520]   damage in their liver they didn't see any damage you know wherever they but they and they they
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:15.960]   basically said hey it didn't hurt them okay but what they what i did never have found and this is
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:21.160]   because you know it's this it hasn't been around that long actually um you know since the late
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:26.520]   90s or late 80s right but i haven't found any studies that said what's the long term because it
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:32.360]   hasn't been long term but what's the study of the long term bioaccumulation of taking C60
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.160]   when you know that it's been processed with solvents you know that that hasn't been studied so and
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:41.080]   they didn't study like you know let's say take let's go through the brain and see how much of the
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:46.120]   salt you know they didn't look for the solvents in the brains in the livers and so forth they just
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:53.720]   basically said there was no damage and so it's C60 i want to just really make sure that that everyone's
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:59.320]   you know understands where i'm coming from is that these studies stand up they do they stand up
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:07.080]   100% that if you you know the if you're a rat you take C60 in oil you're gonna probably live
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:11.400]   twice as long you know you're not going to have any damage in your liver or your spleen you're not
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.040]   going to have any tumors so it's it's an awesome freaking thing to take i mean that's why so many
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:21.880]   people are just jumped up about it okay so you know the study stand they they they are real then
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:27.320]   and but what's what just keeps nagging at me is that there's you know the solvent free thing it
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:34.440]   really nags at me because nobody's looking at okay what's the long-term impact of taking this okay
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:40.840]   because it sort of implies you know that there's there's stuff in there and that and then this is
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:46.200]   very clear you know that that you know this is the the theory right here and then this actually
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:54.360]   proved it so okay food for thought or let us say should i say um C60 for thought or
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:38:01.080]   so anyway i wanted to just share that with you um and that's what i did this last couple of weeks so
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:07.720]   thank you for spending your time with me um i've just welcome your comments about this this has
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:13.880]   really got me perplexed and but uh hey i just want to say thank you thank you for taking your time to
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:18.560]   to watch my video. Have a great day. Aloha!
