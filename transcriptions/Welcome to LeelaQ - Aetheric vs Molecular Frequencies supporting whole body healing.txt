[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   Hello everyone, and welcome to another Tiggers Academy video.
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.240]   I'm your host, Kay Almer, and this video
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.120]   is another installment in the video FAQ series
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.840]   called Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla Quantum
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.600]   Tech and Quantum Uprate.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.480]   So what we do is we pluck out frequently asked questions
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.640]   in the telegram chat groups, and either I answer them
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.720]   or Philip answers them, the owner operator
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.600]   of Layla Quantum Tech.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.000]   So in this particular video, Philip
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.880]   is addressing the question about etheric versus molecular
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.000]   frequencies as a support for whole body healing.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.680]   And what's the difference between the two
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.480]   and essentially what works?
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.840]   So here we go, let's hear what Philip has to say
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.000]   about the difference.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.640]   All right, and then the other one here that kind of came up,
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.880]   someone was asking me, and it was kind of a good question
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.280]   I wanted to ask you, which was, I guess it's
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.480]   in the marketing description.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.040]   So in the marketing description of HEAL 360,
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.440]   and I'm sorry, I didn't go back and verify
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.600]   what the words were being used.
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.320]   But there was just a question or clarification request
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.320]   because it implies the way that the wording implies
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.360]   that the HEAL 360 is, quote, whole body healing,
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.960]   soul, emotions, you know, all of that.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.240]   And so the question was, it was, hey, I thought HEAL 360
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.240]   was all molecular.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.680]   So how does, how does, if so, right, if so,
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.120]   how do molecular frequencies affect etheric situations?
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.680]   Like with the soul and the emotions.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.400]   So, or is it just purely molecular and the wording's weird?
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.840]   - Well, first of all, a molecular frequency
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.800]   is never just molecular, right?
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.880]   It's not physical anymore anyway, right?
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.880]   So it's already sort of etheric as you use it, right?
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.520]   Because it's purely energetic
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.000]   and especially when it's then also upcharged
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.160]   with a high consciousness field,
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.080]   whether that is charged in a card
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.320]   or it's in the quantum algorithm.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.400]   So that's important to note.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.720]   So it's not the physical thing anymore.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.400]   It just came from something physical.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.360]   And it does not matter because you can have,
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.920]   you can have molecular frequencies
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.800]   that work on all kinds of different aspects, right?
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.300]   So it doesn't mean just because it came from
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.440]   molecules that it couldn't help the energy bodies
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.120]   and all of that.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.000]   I mean, this is a great example.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.160]   So it definitely is possible to do that.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.160]   I think it's more difficult to do that, but it's possible.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.560]   - Okay, okay.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.040]   Yeah, that's a really good way of thinking about,
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.640]   'cause I was a little like, when I got asked a question,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.960]   I was like, well, that's a really good question,
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.760]   'cause I was thinking molecular was physical,
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.600]   etheric was a theorem, right?
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.680]   But now about what you just said makes complete sense
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.560]   because it's not molecular frequencies are not physical.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.840]   So yeah, you would definitely have etheric effects
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.880]   from frequencies.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.720]   So, okay.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.400]   - In addition, also it's also not even true
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.360]   that it's a hundred percent molecular
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.600]   because there's also an additional etheric part in it, right?
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   So the benzene gas neutralization, for example,
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.000]   that is something that did not come
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   from any physical molecular substance as an example.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.600]   - Okay.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.760]   - You know, we added that later.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.560]   If you remember, that was a frequent contest,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.000]   but we still--
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.840]   - You added it.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.440]   - Basically added a couple pieces, yeah.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.360]   - Okay, all right.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.320]   No, that's cool.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.440]   Okay, so that's really great.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.600]   That's good to know.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.000]   That's a really good way of looking at it.
