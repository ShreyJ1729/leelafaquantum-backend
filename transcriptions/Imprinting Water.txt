[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and in
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.360]   this video I'd like to share with you the research that I've done on the idea of imprinting water.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.880]   Now if you're someone who's interested in health and healing and performance and longevity then
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.600]   this video might be of interest to you because this is how you use water to achieve improvements
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   in those areas. So first things first is really what is imprinting water? Well at the end of the
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:38.640]   day imprinting water is simply the idea and the practices behind programming water which has
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.960]   the ability to hold memory with information and that information can come in the source of molecular
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.440]   information. It's also known as molecular imprinting. You can also imprint water with your thoughts and
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.880]   emotions, your consciousness. You can also imprint water with different frequencies that can do a
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.880]   lot of different things for you and also you can imprint information in the form of energy by
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.280]   charging that water with positive life force energy. And that's the basic idea. It's information
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.800]   being imprinted onto water that holds a memory. And one thing that I do want to point out that
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.000]   it's not just the water you drink but you yourself are water. Now the amount of water in any human
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.400]   being depends on their age but the average adult individual right now is composed of 65% water.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.040]   So we're not talking about just imprinting water for you know for drinking as you would take like
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.040]   a supplement but you also can imprint the water within your own cells with all of the same things
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.400]   that I've mentioned just now molecular emotions, thoughts, frequency, energy and so forth. So the
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.520]   thing that I want to do share with everybody who may not be familiar with the concept of water
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:57.520]   having memory is the history of that concept being developed over time. So in the 18th century this
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.800]   started way back in the 1800s by the gentleman called Samuel Hanuman who was literally known as
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.240]   the father of homeopathy. Now he established that remedies which was the process of creating diluted
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.960]   water. So he would take a remedy, he would dilute it in water and dilute it down and dilute it down
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.720]   and dilute it down and that's the foundation of homeopathic remedies and to his surprise he had
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.920]   discovered back in the day we're talking you know almost 200 years ago that he discovered that
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.080]   paradoxically the more diluted the remedy the longer its action and the deeper its effect and
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.680]   the fewer doses needed. So he discovered and was one of the first individuals that came out with
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.640]   the idea that hey you know you can literally imprint molecular information onto water and that water
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.120]   then can become a therapeutic. Really fascinating and there's a documentary about Samuel Hanuman.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.960]   Oh by the way everything I'm covering today I've got tons of the research all of the links are in
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.000]   the video description attached to this video if you want to watch any of the documentaries go take
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.800]   a look at any of the products that I mentioned and so forth it's all going to be in this video in
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.320]   the video description. Now the next thing that really pops out which is literally 100 years later
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.000]   but in the early 20th century in the well in the 20th century an individual by his research
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.120]   scientist in France his name is Luke Monteer. Now he was an award-winning Nobel scientist where he
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.240]   had discovered the HIV virus. Now his work with water is literally one of the most profound studies
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.160]   that had ever been done on the idea that water has memory and he further worked off of you know
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.680]   Hanuman's work and he proved that water has a memory but not just from the standpoint of using
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.960]   it as a as a remedy but he actually went and further demonstrated how the information signal
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:00.480]   of virus DNA could be captured in water and transformed into a digital signal that can be
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.280]   emailed to another computer on the other side of the world and that's what he did. The digital
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:14.480]   file received by the other computer then reconstituted the virus DNA in a glass of water.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.760]   So what he discovered was not only does water have memory but it can literally be broken down
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.520]   and digitized and sent somewhere else and then reconstituted in a different class of water which
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.280]   that's what imprinting is and he award-winning you know this we're talking about a Nobel scientist
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.960]   who then went and proved what Hanuman had discovered and then again too I want to point out water has
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.000]   memory this is one of the most famous scientists who had come up with this you know it basically
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.720]   you know added to the body of work in the idea that there are hidden messages in water and that
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.480]   water has memory and that's a doctor Masaru Emoto he was a Japanese doctor and he did this in the
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:04.080]   20th century as well and now Dr. Masaru's experiments prove that molecular structure of water can be
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:11.120]   altered off of your consciousness off of thoughts and emotions now this base now this was based on
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.640]   water's ability to train to retain the memory of everything it comes across so positive words and
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.040]   good thoughts can bring positive changes to water now he had documented his work in a couple of his
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.600]   books one called the hidden messages in water and another book called the true power of water and
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.000]   if you wanted to watch a fascinating video about water holding memory is the video called messages
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.600]   from water where it covers all of Dr. Emoto's work and how you just simply you know really
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.400]   talking to water or writing down like the word love and putting it on a glass of water can transfer
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.360]   that conscious emotion into the water and then of course you would then you know be able to drink
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.200]   it but in his work it is one of the most fascinating works that has ever been done on top of Luke
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.640]   Montaier and Samuel Hanuman so that just you know really kind of just definites the idea that you
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.240]   know water does have memory and if it has memory you can program it so now why would you okay so
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.360]   as I had mentioned just a little minute a few minutes ago that you know the idea of imprinting
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.440]   water whether it's water you drink or yourself the water in yourselves is for health purposes
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.600]   and the idea is you know supplements and and and positive you know just positive emotions and
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.520]   and just energy you know just giving yourself energy giving yourself you know just the emotional
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.320]   states that you want psychologically and emotionally but the whole idea is your health and all of
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.560]   its different you know meanings can be affected by simply imprinting the water that you drink or
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.240]   imprinting the water that's inside of you and another really huge area of imprinting water
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.880]   and why you would want to do that is in the form of healing because you know there's a million
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.840]   different things that can go wrong with people and there's a million different remedies for all
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:09.120]   of those things and one idea of imprinting water is to imprint the remedy which is homeopathy you
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:16.400]   know remedies but the idea also is you can imprint any type of frequency any type of molecular substance
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.720]   into the water that you drink in this water that's in your cells to assist your body in healing itself
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.560]   so not only you know like taking the the physical substance you know but you could also imprint that
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.840]   that frequency of that substance into the very water in your cells and the water that you're
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.800]   drinking that replenishes that water to help you heal the other one is performance and the one
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.080]   thing about you know being a biohacker you know i've been a biohacker tinkering person for a long
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.600]   time is the idea of performance and one of the things that I do is I really you know in terms of
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.320]   brain boosting you know I really want to be sharp and you know as I get older you know boosting my
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.440]   cognitive abilities is really important to me as well as longevity which is the fourth thing
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:05.680]   so you know how you perform and also the longevity aspect of it because you know as we age we start
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:11.920]   to fall apart you know we really start breaking down from a physical standpoint so not only could
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:18.320]   you improve your performance but you can also extend your life by using some of these
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:24.000]   by you know basically it's a biohack for you know imprinting water to help your body maintain
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.440]   full vigor you know and and just like everything from you know as you know we when we get older
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.800]   right we know we start decreasing our levels of choline we decrease our levels of you know up
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:40.000]   testosterone and estrogen you know all of these things just we start we stop making a lot you know
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.600]   we just stop making it and you can actually help your body by imprinting the water inside you and
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:51.040]   the water that you drink with some of those things and substances that'll help you extend your life
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.720]   and and also improve your performance so these are the four really important reasons why you
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:02.800]   would want to imprint water and and you know this and this is exactly why I do it so now how do you
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:09.520]   imprint water this is where it gets really really complicated because there's so many different
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.560]   ways and I wanted to kind of make a video to kind of you know consolidate all of that and kind of
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.880]   just explain you know how do you imprint water if you are interested in imprinting and adding this
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.080]   to your life and adding this to your you know your your process of just keeping yourself healthy happy
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:32.480]   living long and all that and so the first one as I'd mentioned earlier with with with Hanuman and
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.600]   which is the idea of dilution and so now this is not that view I'm not going to get too deep into
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:43.920]   dilution if you want to understand how to make homeopathic remedies is the key phrase type that
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.200]   into YouTube and there's going to be a whole bunch of different videos on how to go ahead and make
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.720]   molecular imprinted water and or homeopathic remedies but that's really the oldest one I mean
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.080]   that's where it all started right so if you want to imprint water dilution is is the way to go
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.600]   and it's been that way for a million right I mean for hundreds of years now the other concept of
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.440]   course as I mentioned with Dr. Imodo is imprinting water through consciousness through your thoughts
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.120]   and feelings so I would really recommend if you're interested in doing that then you would
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:20.320]   definitely want to take a look at Imodo's work and then you get into the concept of biogeometry
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.560]   magnets and magnetic patterns you could also imprint water you know which is a lot of the
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:32.400]   products that are on the market today that help you or that you know actually do water imprinting
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.200]   our electromagnetic devices and there are a few that are actually using the idea of quantum
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:44.640]   mechanics to also imprint water so there's six basic ways to imprint water and their dilution
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:51.200]   consciousness biogeometry magnetic fields electromagnetic devices and actual quantum devices
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.000]   or at the end of the day you could just buy it and there's a whole industry around that and there's
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.280]   one primary you know business that actually sells it and they call these imprinted water they
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:09.680]   they've come up with the term infosuticles and and you could just buy it if you didn't want to make
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:16.080]   it yourself the main difference now I do want to point out amongst all of these is it can go from
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:22.240]   free or you don't have to pay a dime to imprint water and then you can get as fancy as you want
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.920]   and get into the literally thousands of dollars worth of stuff you know to go ahead and imprint
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:34.480]   water if you want to really get into it and base and and also have a ton of more options
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.960]   in terms of what you put in the water you know the more you want to do and the more you want
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.840]   to get into it you know the more expensive it's going to get and that's really the main different
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:49.600]   you know difference honestly when I did all of this research was really just the cost factor
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.440]   and the amount of effort you want to put in it because you could just simply do it simply
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:59.200]   for free and not and you know you can imprint water with your thoughts but then at the same time
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.840]   if you really want to get into it you know you can spend a lot of money and and really just have
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.920]   so many more options than just doing it through your consciousness you know and through dilution
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.560]   so you know that's those are the ways so let's talk about each one of those ways now I did talk
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:20.800]   already about dilution I talked about consciousness so let's jump right into number three bio geometry
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:28.640]   now one of the ways you can definitely imprint water is by using a hack it's it's a hack you know
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:35.120]   called bio geometry and and one of the most amazing items that I had run across in the research was
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.600]   a you know I've been familiar with bio geometry for years but I ran across a podcast with the actual
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:46.720]   founder of the concept of bio geometry at Dr. Abraham Karim now there's a link in the video
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.120]   description below to this podcast and if you're interested in water and you're interested in bio
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.960]   geometry you really really really want to listen to this podcast it is awesome and he really gets
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:04.560]   into the idea of of basically sacred waters and and and how he had discovered is his lifetime work
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:11.600]   is this one thing which is bio geometry and what bio geometry simply is and in in my definition
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:18.000]   it's essentially how he discovered and he's one of the many people that I've run across and all
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.080]   of the different research that I've done that has figured out how to hack the ether and you know
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:29.440]   ether ether you know it's the energy all around us right and and so it's basically you know it's
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:35.680]   just a hack he discovered how it works and then he came up and he and from his perspective there's
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.720]   multiple different perspectives on how to hack the ether but he you know he came at it from a
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:46.480]   geometry standpoint because he's a trained architect you know and so he looked at it from a geometry
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.760]   standpoint and built up this you know this this incredible body of work called bio geometry
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:59.520]   now in his book bio geometry signatures okay he basically documented a ton of different ways
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:07.120]   you could actually use geometry right you know based on hacking the ether and using that in
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:12.800]   print water so now if we take a look at his work and if you just you know this is just one of his
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.680]   books he's got several books on the idea of bio geometry but he has a book called bio geometry
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.320]   signatures and if you just simply if you want to learn how to do it you just you know he's
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.440]   basically great book but then at the very back you know he's discovered we're talking about a
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:33.520]   lifetime of work this is his body of work for his life and he's basically come up and discovered
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:40.000]   through tons of testing what are the different geometric shapes that affect the ether around us
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.760]   and so he's got all of these different shapes that he's discovered that will do different things for
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:51.040]   the human body and so there's you know there's shapes for brain there's shapes for ears I mean
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.400]   just everything that you could have an issue with with you know here's one for eyes food intolerances
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.760]   and so forth heart you know heart health hemorrhoids jaws and I mean it just goes on and on and in
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:07.600]   his book he basically you know shares with everybody in this one book called bio geometry signatures
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:13.760]   all of the different shapes that affect different things in the ether which is us and so all you
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.720]   would do to imprint water with bio geometry signatures is you could print it out you could draw it
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.640]   and just put the water on it just literally put the water on the shape and let it sit there
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:31.360]   and that you know basically the the essence of that geometry that bio geometry will then imprint
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:37.680]   into water and so it is fascinating and I highly recommend listening to this podcast and understanding
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:43.520]   the concept of bio geometry from the concept of the life force in water and then he goes into you
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.920]   know how he discovered that so it's a really great podcast now the other one too that
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:54.080]   that I do I do this one all the time I haven't really played around with bio geometry
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.720]   as much as I played around with magnets and electromagnetic devices that's sort of my
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:04.960]   my thing but one of the things is you can use magnets to imprint water I did an entire video
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:11.920]   a few months ago called bio magnetics which is the concept of magnet therapy and so now there's
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.600]   you can I got a link to that video if you're interested in imprinting water and or magnetic
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.440]   therapy there's I did a whole video on that separately but just in a nutshell there's a couple
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:29.200]   of really great books on the subject and of course really deep research done by scientists and one of
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:36.000]   them is the magnetic effect done by Albert Roy Davis and Walter Rawls and they discovered as well
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.760]   as what the work here in magnet therapy of a doctor of William Philpot now these two teams
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:49.680]   separately now basically did a lifetime again you know 30 years of research by these individuals
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:56.400]   each into the idea of using magnets to help heal and and for health and they discovered
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:02.880]   in their work you know that the north pole of a magnet produces a different energy
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.960]   than the south pole of the magnet and they do different things and the thing about the north pole
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:14.480]   is that it is it has a very very very strong healing effect and so by imprinting water with
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:21.040]   north pole magnetic energy you produce essentially what is a healing water and I'll leave it at that
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.920]   but you if you want to watch the other video there's tons of information about this specific topic
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:31.760]   but bottom line is you can use magnets north pole only now don't know I want to point that out is
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:39.520]   north pole energy on water will imprint healing frequency or healing energy into the water that's
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:45.360]   incredibly therapeutic for you know anyone that you know that wants to take it now the other thing
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:52.400]   too which is really interesting is that a a gentleman who had also spent a lifetime of his you know of
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:18:01.040]   his life on the research where he had combined right the idea of biogeometry with magnet therapy
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:06.320]   so he put the two together and he wrote this book called the paper doctor that it's really
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:12.400]   fascinating because it's the combination of the two so it's not only just you know magnetic energy
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:18.800]   but also biogeometry combined into what he called magnetic patterns so if you take a look at his work
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:27.040]   in his book called the paper doctor then essentially it's the same concept as magnet therapy where you
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:32.640]   would place water on the north pole of a magnet to you know embrace you know to to receive the
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:40.640]   north pole energy but his thing is he he would he had a a little uh i guess called a board that had
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:46.000]   a north pole facing magnet and then he would put a shape on top of that board and then put the water
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.760]   on top of his shape and then when you get into what his you know what his discoveries were in his
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:19:00.160]   research where he had spent a lifetime you know uh you know discovering and testing and experimenting
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:06.000]   was he'd basically come up with a whole bunch of different shapes that would amplify the magnetic
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.640]   energy to even further enhance the healing uh of you know energy of the water you know that you
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.840]   would you know you'd place on the board so you'd have the magnet the the shape put the water on
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:23.520]   and then you would have he had remedies for everything from traumatic events which is the here's the
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.720]   shape for that you know these are his quote his own bio geometry shapes that he had discovered
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:34.640]   for that now lifting you know lifting your spirits if you're poison ivy the shape for that
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.360]   there's here's you know for bee stings the shape for that and so you can see the idea
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:47.120]   where not only did dr kurim discover bio geometry as a way to hack the ether and then using that to
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:53.280]   imprint water but then don jirard also discovered that there are different geometry shapes as well
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:59.360]   to use with magnets specifically with magnets to also imprint water so it's a fascinating
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:07.040]   use of the combination of magnetic therapy and also bio geometry therapy in terms of how to
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.800]   imprint water with healing properties so those those are two you know actually well three amazing
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:19.760]   ways to do it and the next one is of using electromagnetics for imprinting water now this is where we get
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:26.160]   into powered you know electricity using devices and there's a full spectrum of these things and I'd
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.000]   like to walk you through them because they're quite fascinating and I know a lot of you guys
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.240]   are really into gizmos and products as much as I am I mean I'm really into it and so I knew that
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.760]   this would be interesting for you and and I'm just going to walk you through and kind of give you a
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.880]   little you know just a little video that I took out of all the different tutorials
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:50.320]   but so let me walk you down the list of just the the top you know like there's literally like I
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.840]   think nine or ten that I found that I kind I want to share with you in terms of okay now if you just
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:02.240]   want to subscribe to a service or buy a gizmo and use that to imprint water then yeah totally go
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:08.240]   for it I do it as well now the very first one and this came and this really kind of kicked off with
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:14.720]   my last video where I interviewed Richard Jordan from New Image Lifestyles and so he's
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:20.640]   he's an affiliate for A/O scan and the company's called Sollex and the product is called A/O
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.680]   scan and what that product does is it does diagnostics and it uses a smartphone
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:32.960]   or a little pad that you connect to the smartphone because it's like an app and then using that to
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.840]   imprint water so not only does it so it would basically scan your health and then it makes
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.640]   recommendations on here you should imprint this into water and then drink it and that's what the
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:49.360]   Sollex A/O scan does. Genius Insight is another company that's literally another app that you can buy
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:55.760]   that will also imprint water and it also does diagnostics and uses a smartphone plus a little
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:01.200]   thingy that you plug into it and here's an example of one of their little things that you plug into
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:08.160]   your tablet or your smartphone you run the app you do your diagnostics it's off of you know using
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:14.560]   your voice voice analysis it's that whole Sherry Edwards thing it then it then takes in your voice
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:21.520]   it doesn't analysis of your diagnostics of your health and then make recommendations on you know
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:27.680]   here's a sound file that then you would play into water and and then go ahead and drink it as in
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:32.720]   regards to imprinting water and so that's how these two products work now there's another
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.280]   company out there called Frequency Shop and they're just basically a library of frequencies
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:44.240]   and then that is connected to an app and then you would subscribe to those frequencies and then you
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.960]   would through your app then you would play you would put your water on that and you would then
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:56.000]   imprint water using your smartphone Infopathy is also another company that does the same thing it
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.720]   is a giant library of frequencies and you just pick and choose which ones you want to use
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:07.360]   and it sells different products by that you connect into your computer and or phone or tablet
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:14.240]   and you can you can imprint water using Infopathy using a PMF which is a pulse electromagnetic field
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.760]   like little wand paddle thing or you can use speakers to do you know to actually transfer
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:26.640]   the audio file from Infopathy which is a frequency file to the water so you can imprint water using
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:33.600]   those methods another one is called Spooky 2 now Spooky 2 is it started out as a huge
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:39.040]   rife technology company which is Raymond Reif you know frequencies for healing and health
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:45.360]   and so it does Spooky 2 has a feature in it and now it is basically a very large software program
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:50.000]   you would run on a computer and then you would connect to your computer a frequency generator
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.200]   here's an example right here they have basic two models of generators and also then you could
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:01.200]   then from the from the software it tells it tells the frequency generator what to output
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.400]   the frequency generator then goes to an accessory so the accessories that you could use to imprint
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:13.840]   water with Spooky 2 is either a PMF wand again like Infopathy you can use cold laser and that's
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:19.280]   what this picture right here is an example of using the cold laser accessory that Spooky
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:25.520]   sells to actually imprint water using bio photons or the light coming from the laser you could also
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:32.880]   use their plasma antenna to do that as well to transfer the imprinted frequencies onto water
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:40.000]   via bio photons or photons and then plasma I'm sorry that's the plasma antenna and/or scalar
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.760]   and then they actually have a scalar device that you can actually use a scalar generator
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:48.160]   but these are all the different things that fall under Spooky they sell a ton of different stuff
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:53.040]   but they have four different ways that you could actually connect to their system using a generator
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:25:00.720]   and then outputting whatever you want to imprint into into water and they have a huge library
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.800]   now if you ever want and this is another thing about Spooky the cool thing about Spooky the software
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.040]   is free so you can always download the software kick it off and then just go and produce it you
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.880]   know and kind of just figure out what's in the library so you have full access to the library
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:18.400]   but you need the equipment to use it Infopathy same thing giant library but you need the you need
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:24.080]   the equipment and but with Infopathy if you just have a set of really good speakers you don't have
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:29.120]   to buy anything else other than just access to their library now there's another one here called
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:35.200]   soda instruments and soda instruments used to make a product called lightworks you can still find
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:42.240]   them used on eBay but they've switched to a different led light you know product right now but
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.120]   the lightworks that I'm going to show you in the video is just one is I bought it back in the day
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:54.560]   and I've used it for imprinting water now this specific product has it's it has a very small library
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:01.200]   primarily of a set of frequencies called the nozier frequencies and they're very you know they're
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:07.280]   all healing frequencies and you simply use the the light one which is basically an led light
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:14.080]   device and you would place your water on that and it would imprint water the frequency through
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.960]   photons into the water so you can imprint water through light and that's the point I want to
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:24.560]   make just like you would use a cold laser light with spooky you can use any type of
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:29.840]   you know like if all of you guys who have red light devices well you could capture right the
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:36.240]   frequency coming off of those lights whatever kind of lamps you use I have red lights and also
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:42.880]   have a UV lights you know for vitamin D and I've actually captured those frequencies in water
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:49.680]   and and and you know and for that purpose from the aspect of imprinting water using photons now the
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:56.160]   last one too as I mentioned with Infopathies you can use just audio a file and then using speakers
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:02.320]   to output the sound and putting water in front of that and imprinting your water with whatever audio
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:07.440]   you want to imprint on now I did another video called copying frequencies with the Leila Quantum
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:13.760]   Block I'll put a link in the video description below and that video covers a bunch of different
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:19.840]   libraries that you could find available for free out there in the world right that you can then
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:25.440]   extract audio files from health and healing and longevity and you know all that kind of a performance
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:31.840]   type of sounds that then can be imprinted into water then then could be transferred from the
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:36.240]   from the speakers and then you would imprint water just putting the putting the water right
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.800]   there in front of the speakers and again you know you can buy it now there's a company I don't want
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.960]   to leave them out so they're so important and they're and they're one of the you know one of the
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.360]   good companies out there that are doing this and then they're called NES health and now they provide
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:55.760]   a diagnostic service service where they do all the diagnostics just like A/O scan and genius insight
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.480]   but what they do is they give out the diagnostics and then they tell you you know hey this would help
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.680]   you and then you would buy you know then this is there like you know this is just a small snippet
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:11.600]   of you know their quote library but their library is in the form of infosuticals so instead of you
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:16.480]   having to make it yourself you would just then go ahead and buy whichever you know remedy that
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:22.640]   they recommend and then take it that way all right so that's that's the body of electromagnetic
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:29.920]   it's a lot of different products and there's a lot to learn and just as an FYI for me I've used
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:37.760]   info pathy I've used spooky too I used the soda light work so I also use speakers to imprint water
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:43.920]   so I do the last four right here and then I also do the Leila quantum tech and a light life ring so
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:50.640]   now this we get we're getting into another subject now this one here is using quantum mechanics for
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.760]   imprinting water now it's a different approach none of these are powered devices but what these
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:02.080]   are are quantum devices that can then transfer the information in the water right that's what
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:07.520]   imprinting is you're transferring information into water and so by transferring information into
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:12.880]   water you can do it through a quantum effect and so the quantum effect now some of the products out
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:18.160]   there for imprinting water through that you know means right through quantum mechanics
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.760]   there's one product out there that's just one of the pinnacle products for this area
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:27.280]   is called the Analema wand and what they've discovered throughout you know through their research
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:33.920]   and there's a fantastic interview I watched last night with the CEO of Analema where he was discussing
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:39.200]   all of his scientific research and and basically how they discovered and then they've been doing
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.600]   tons of studies on it but they basically discovered what they call the mother water
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.920]   and the mother water that lives deep in the earth that's full of all this incredible life force
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:53.120]   energy and they've been able to replicate it to and then they put it inside of this little
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:58.960]   it's a quartz crystal wand and simply by stirring water with that wand you transfer that mother
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:04.320]   water frequency into the water you're drinking so at the end of the day they only sell one
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:09.680]   you know one quote product of four imprinting water which is mother water but you can import
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:16.080]   but the idea the idea here is through the quantum effect they're imprinting or you can imprint
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:23.200]   the the frequency of the mother water into whatever you drink using an analema wand okay
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:28.080]   now also here this is the one area of all of the stuff I just mentioned that I'm actually the subject
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:34.400]   or a subject matter expert on which is the Layla quantum tech now what they do if you're not
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.960]   familiar with them is they sell quantum devices and they and they sell all sorts of different
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:44.000]   devices and this one here is called the quantum block and this is just a little video that I made
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.440]   you know while I was actually imprinting actually I was copying the frequency of browns gas water
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:54.080]   so I was basically using a browns gas generator and bubbling that into water and capturing that
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.800]   frequency onto a card but you know it just it just stands as an example of how you could
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:04.720]   put water in one of their blocks to then imprint the water with quantum energy you know life force
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:10.640]   energy and at the same time you can put frequency cards along with that water and you could put
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:16.160]   whatever you want in that water whatever you have like if you got a you know vitamin C tablet you
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.880]   throw that in the block with the water and boom the water picks up the vitamin C uh you know the
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:27.760]   frequency of it so it is definitely one of the most versatile and and and easiest to use but
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:34.160]   not cheap okay but it is so easy and I'll tell you you've got so many more options with the the
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:40.960]   Layla quantum tech cubes or blocks and so you can definitely use that now the other thing is
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:47.520]   something called a light light ring and also known as a tensor coil now these are another type of
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:54.160]   device that goes back to an individual his name was Slim Spirling and he discovered something
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:32:01.440]   remarkable about copper wires and and so he basically created what he calls and it's just a it's
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:09.440]   literally a coil of twisted copper wires but he discovered just like Karim yeah or just like you
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:17.040]   know Karim Dr Karim just like Don Girard with the magnetic shapes he also discovered that the geometry
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:22.800]   and if you want to hack the ether geometry is critical and so what Slim Spirling discovered
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:30.000]   is that specific lengths of copper wire when twisted together in a certain direction and then
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.280]   connected together created a ring and that ring would then basically hack the ether and it would
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:40.080]   basically produce positive life force energy it would it would actually generate that it would
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:45.440]   actually collect it from around the environment and then really concentrate it around this little
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:51.440]   ring and so now for years and years and years I was just tinkering around with with this technology I
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:57.440]   you know basically replicated all the different products that they had as a DIY project and I
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.120]   made you know I made little tensor coils that I would put around and I would just carry it around
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:05.680]   with me and I would just put it around anything I was drinking and so you can imprint water
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:11.120]   with light life rings or life light sorry life light rings and you could just put the ring around
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:16.480]   the water glass and let it sit there and it's going to just infuse life force energy into the water
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:22.720]   using that quantum effect using those coils so now here I want to show you just a little like
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.040]   compilation video just so you can kind of visualize how all these different things work because I
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:32.720]   know that you guys like this kind of stuff so let's kind of walk you through that now this right here
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:40.560]   is the this is AO scan and now I AO scan basically does as I was mentioning is you basically take
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.960]   the water that you have and you would basically have the app running and you would place the
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:52.080]   water on top of the app and through this fractal amplifier it's going to imprint whatever AO scan
[00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:58.400]   is saying that you should whoops whatever AO scan is saying that would you know they're recommending
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:04.080]   for your you know specific you know results of your diagnostics it's going to then go ahead
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:10.000]   and imprint those you know those healing frequencies into the water and that's how you would imprint
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.120]   water with AO scan so now the next one once this guy stopped oh yeah this is the next one now this
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:21.920]   is genius insight now what they're doing is they're using something called a remedy plate you
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.720]   connect it into your tablet smartphone you run this is running this is genius insight running
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:31.360]   here it's done the diagnostics and then it's now going to basically transfer through the remedy
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:37.840]   plate this is the frequency shop frequency shop is simply using the smartphone again and you're
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:42.560]   basically again you're placing the smartphone or the water on top of your smartphone you're running
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:47.760]   the program and through fractal you know amplifying just like the other one this one is info pathy
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.560]   now they use little pucks they're like little PMF pucks and they basically then transfer the
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:59.120]   imprint onto water by just placing the glass on the puck this is spooky scaler a spooky scaler has
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:05.920]   this large little suitcase thing called a spooky scaler generator and then this is how you would
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:12.640]   use it the one thing I do want to kind of point out about spooky scaler and we just kind of go back
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:19.280]   here is it's just the probably the absolute most complicated way to do it because you've got to
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.760]   run the software you've got to plug in the frequency generator you've got to make sure it all works
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:28.480]   because it doesn't just happen magically and then you have to go through the generator through the
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:34.720]   menu actually what you would do is transfer the software programs the different frequencies
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:39.760]   onto your generator it can hold up to I think 20 or 40 and then you then go through your generator
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:45.200]   pick the one you want like here's one that says cold coughing so someone who's got a coughing and
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.720]   then you would then run that through the generator into one of those four devices you know those
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:57.040]   accessories PMF laser so forth or scaler generator and then play the frequency through the the
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:03.040]   accessory to then imprint water so you can imagine as I just described there's a lot of steps involved
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:09.520]   um I don't even use spooky for imprinting water it is complicated and it just it's a lot of effort
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:14.320]   you know and I'm kind of lazy but that's just kind of the the thing I do want to point out now this is
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:19.920]   the life this is the light works wand by soda instruments and this is the one that only has
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.320]   no gear so just to kind of like on a limo where they've only got one thing you could use to imprint
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:29.520]   water that the light works device only has the no gear frequencies I think there's only about nine
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:34.800]   this is NES health and now this is where you would buy NES health now they have basically they're
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.520]   telling you take like five drops of the water they you know and then you would basically just drink
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:44.480]   the infosuticle directly from the little bottle now this is the onolima wand this is what I was
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:49.600]   talking about earlier the mother water in the onolima wand is inside that little crystal
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:54.480]   vial and then you would stir uh you basically stir based on the quantity of the water and then
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:37:00.080]   you're transferring you're imprinting the water with the mother water in the vial to the water
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.360]   here's Philip von Holzendorf now he's showing basically how to imprint water using a lela quantum block
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:10.720]   now the thing I want to point out is that you would like you saw in my little video doing browns
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:15.680]   gas you place the water in the block but you see this thing right there that little card a
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:21.120]   lela sells their frequencies on cards and so you would put the frequency card in with the water
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:26.960]   and at that point the the frequency then copies to the water it quote imprints the water with the
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:32.400]   frequency this is slim spurling with the like life rings and this is what they look like and his
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:38.080]   here's he's basically in an interview talking about how he came up or discovered this idea in the
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:43.120]   geometry behind it and what it does and his testing that he's done and that's kind of what you know
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:49.040]   that he had created were were these rings and that's what they all look like okay so now let's get
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.600]   into frequently asked questions because I had a bunch when I got into this and I'm sure you do
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:58.400]   too so now you're like wow okay water has memory there's a bunch of different ways I can imprint
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:04.320]   water these are great reasons why but you know hey what are the details behind it so let's talk
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.400]   about you know like what's the best water to use how long you should use it and blah blah blah okay
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.440]   so here's some of the questions that I kind of came out with and so what I had done was I went
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.040]   through every one of those sites that I just mentioned every one of those companies and I went
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:23.200]   through their FAQs and took a look at all the different information that they provided and it
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:28.560]   kind of boiled down to just four out of like nine that really kind of just talked about imprinting
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:34.720]   water you know there's they do so much different stuff but if they had any specific FAQs about
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:41.040]   imprinting water then I went through all of those and then basically condensed it into this little
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:46.480]   tiny section here for you so you can kind of get a feel for what are the are the answers from quote
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:53.120]   the experts who have made you know companies out of doing this so you can kind of get a general idea
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:57.600]   about you know like how you know how do you go about it and and what what should be some of the
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:02.640]   the ways to do this if you're interested in imprinting water so not only are there ways to do it
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.800]   but here's some of the questions right for you that I've kind of dug through the FAQs
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.640]   so first what you know first question really is like what's the best water to use for this
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:16.000]   and so now all across the spectrum there are people using distilled water there are people
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.280]   using RSO water which is reserved for reverse osmosis water spring water has been mentioned
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:27.200]   in the literature mineral water has been mentioned structured water and energized water so any one of
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:34.640]   these six different forms of water or combinations thereof are perfectly fine for imprinting there's
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:39.360]   you know and so that's kind of what I found in all the different FAQs and in all of the different
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:44.080]   imprinting water tutorials that I watched you know which I've been doing nothing but for two weeks
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.200]   and so that it really comes down to that and the only thing that I think that I would you know
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:54.560]   this is from me which is the one thing you don't ever want to use and you shouldn't even be drinking
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.280]   this anyway you should definitely don't drink tap water I mean even no matter where you live
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:05.680]   you know the municipalities put crap in that water and you do not want to drink tap water so
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:10.720]   you definitely want to have it filtered and you want to have it purified and then you want to use
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.520]   the best clean water you can but I want to point out that you know perusing all of the
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:20.960]   literature on the subject you know anything goes in terms of of you know how do you want to or what
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:26.960]   type of water you want to use for imprinting and I do want to caveat that it did come out in in a
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:35.440]   couple of places where the idea of using spring and or mineral water is is you know had a better
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:40.080]   effect in terms of storage of the frequency on the water and and that kind of makes sense if you
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:44.960]   think about it because you know distilled water is if you put a T you know TDC meter in it it's
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:51.120]   going to show zero PPM meaning there's nothing but water in there but if you put or you have mineral
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:56.000]   mineralized water or spring water it's going to have minerals in it you know the natural
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.760]   natural water it contains minerals you know dissolved minerals in the water and that I would
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:07.520]   have just you know I'm just assuming that you know because the the literature is saying that if you
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:13.440]   use mineral water the frequency stays in the water longer that implies to me and I'm just
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:20.400]   assuming here that it gives you know the minerals in the water gives the frequency something to bond
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.960]   to you know that's kind of what I'm I'm coming up with here but that's the idea is that you know
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:30.240]   that mineral water is probably one of the best forms of water to use based on the literature
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:34.800]   but you can use any of the any of the various different six waters that I mentioned now in terms
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:39.440]   of how you know should I clear the water first now this is something for those of you guys who you
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:43.920]   know who use crystals for healing then you know that you know that you know that you know that
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:51.200]   anything that you use anything you get which water is a liquid crystal it and it has memory and because
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:57.120]   of that it's going to have memory when you get it so even coming out of your tap and then going
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:02.000]   through your filtration process and here you've got this glass of water well it's already full of
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.120]   memories and so those memories that have come through all of the different molecular substances
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.120]   that the water has included because you know this is something everyone should realize through what
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:16.960]   I'm trying to say here is even if you take water from your tap and you run it to your RSO system
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:22.880]   or whatever filtration process you use and you poured into a glass you may have gotten rid of the
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:28.240]   actual you know sediments pathogens etc you know like you know forever chemicals and all that crap
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:32.960]   you know that's a fluoride you know that stuff that they're trying to kill us with and so but you
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:38.800]   might have a purified glass of water you've got rid of all that crap but because of molecular
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:46.000]   imprinting you know i.e. the work of Samuel Hanuman the work of lukemonte air they proved that even
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.680]   if you got rid of that stuff the water has the memory of that stuff still in it and so the question
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:57.040]   is is should I clear that memory first and so what's interesting is in the FAQs that I went
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:03.120]   through and on the different products that I ran through with you that only AO scan and frequency
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:07.760]   shopper saying yeah you really should clear the water first nobody else talks about it and just
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:12.000]   those two and they say yeah AO scan frequency shopper like yeah you should clear it and they
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.080]   actually provide a frequency you can run on the water it's a clearing frequency before you then
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.560]   imprint the water and so there's there with their answer to the question should I clear the water
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:27.760]   first as a resounding yes and they actually give you the means by which to do so what's interesting
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:33.440]   is nobody else mentions it but I did talk with Philip Leila quantum tech about that and he was
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:39.280]   basically telling me no you don't need to clear the water because his device you know infuses quantum
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:44.160]   energy into the water and that clears the water so it's kind of like it's got a built-in clearing
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.960]   frequency in it so he's saying no you don't need to clear the water first by the process of putting
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:53.520]   water into a block you've cleared it already and then you put the frequency card and then you
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:59.280]   imprint so that was kind of you know his take on it now the other question to ask is what's the best
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:05.040]   container to use across the board everyone's using glass now you can use so I'm just going
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:10.720]   with the answer to that is glass and I also you can also use paper and so I use paper cups a lot
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:14.880]   when I'm transferring frequencies back and forth and the idea really is to just put the most
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:20.960]   you know to put the least barrier to the water as possible so you know just so nobody says use
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:26.720]   metal they all just use glass so that's the answer to that or me I use paper as well now the other
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:31.760]   question here that really comes up in a lot of the FAQs is how long do I run imprinting you know
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:37.040]   how long do I run the the you know the imprinting file and so forth well that really depends on the
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.560]   method that you're using you've got like as you just watched there's a ton of different methods
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:48.080]   so like how which method are you using and how much water quantity of water are you trying to
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:53.920]   imprint so each one is different there's no one size fits all answer on that and the answer is
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:58.560]   it depends on the method you're using and the quantity of water so if you buy a product or you
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.520]   subscribe to a service you got to go check with them on how long you should run that now I did
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:08.560]   check with Layla Q for you block owners and basically his his think comment was follow the
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:13.440]   timing guidelines on charging stuff you know so you just look at the I created a quick reference
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:18.400]   guide so you just you just use follow whatever the timing is that it takes to quote charge whatever
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:24.560]   it is and in fact charging water is in that quick reference guide so just take a look at your quick
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:30.560]   reference guide depending on what block you own so you know how long you should quote run imprinting
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:36.480]   i.e. charge water okay now the other questions here is how long does the frequency stay in the water
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:42.560]   now this was interesting nobody had the same answer the different FAQs had different answers
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:48.240]   based on their products so now frequency shop basically just said quotations four months frequency
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:55.280]   stays in the water four months once you imprint it info pathi was was basically saying hey if you
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:46:00.080]   use distilled water it's three days if you use mineralized water 30 days that's kind of where I
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:04.560]   got that whole mineral wise you know mineralized water hold frequency longer and again you know
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:08.960]   these guys are the experts in their field so that's what they're saying so anywhere from three
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.680]   to 30 days depending on the type of water you use now anolema was really interesting because
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:19.440]   they're saying basically hey they've tested it up up to four years once you create anolema you
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:25.200]   know you create anolema water which is also known as mother water once you stir that in there and
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:30.320]   you you've transferred there imprinted the water it can store for up to four years but you know
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:34.720]   who stores water for four years but the idea is that you know it really would last a long time
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:39.600]   and that's according to them now according to philip at layla quantum tech I asked him about that
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:46.080]   and he says you know they tested the idea they tested it where they know you know that hey if you
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.160]   put water in there in a frequency that you know that the water will pick up the energy it'll pick
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:56.880]   up the frequency but they didn't test for how long and depending on so his his comment was was
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.280]   yes it definitely does that because they've tested that but they have never tested like you
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:05.760]   know like anolema literally tested and you know and they tested it year by year by year by year
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:11.120]   to figure out what that four-year mark was but layla hasn't tested to say you know how long so his
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:16.800]   answer when I asked him about this was philip basically says it depends on the strength of the
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:22.720]   charge we haven't tested yet we don't have an answer and so I would basically say based on that if
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:28.640]   you're charging water using a layla block the thing that philip did stipulate was that water is
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:35.120]   incredibly dynamic and it will lose its charge in a very short period of time you know like days
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:40.080]   and he said that what they did notice was that the frequency left the water faster than the charge
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:47.120]   than the energy and so basically and he didn't say this but I'm saying it is you know based on what
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:53.360]   he was telling me using imprinting water with a layla quantum block probably means
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:58.720]   you should drink it as you make it okay until we know more all right now in terms of like how
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:04.640]   you should store imprinted water this came from only two places commented on this in terms of
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:10.160]   storing it's another frequency shot basically said hey you know what it's it is recommended
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:16.000]   that 18 inches or two feet are a safe distance to protect your imprinted water in reference to
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.600]   electronic electromagnetic frequencies emf producing devices so in other words don't put it
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:27.520]   you know don't store it anywhere near like two feet away minimum away from your wi-fi routers
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:31.920]   you know electrical outlets you know anything you know that would produce an emf and then
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:37.280]   info pathy also said in their FAQ that icy water should be stored at room temperature away from
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:43.120]   direct sunlight and and at least one meter away from electrical devices so they were also kind of
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:47.840]   you know basically reinforcing the frequency shop in terms of like how you should store so if you
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:53.120]   make this and you don't drink it right away keep it away from electrical devices and keep it out
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:57.200]   of direct sunlight and you know then that kind of goes to you crystal guys you know this right
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:02.000]   you want to clear a crystal what do you do put it in the sun for 24 hours you know for two days
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.280]   or i put you know you used to clear crystals myself i used to put them in the sun based on
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:12.080]   all the advice from the crystal experts out there and sunlight will clear so if you put it in the
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:16.240]   sun you're going to clear out the frequency you put it next to electrical magnetic devices what's
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:20.720]   going to happen that's going to override your frequency and you're going to end up with emf
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:26.240]   water so yeah definitely keep it away and keep it out of sun and you know depending on what you
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:30.000]   made or what you used to make it you've got your storage length of storched
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.240]   information there the other question that i had was like you know how often should people drink
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:40.960]   imprinted water and so this was an interesting response was the frequency shop came out in
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.440]   their FAQ and they said basically hey the longer you have this is a recommendation the longer you
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:49.600]   have an illness the longer you will have to use imprinted water as an example a person who's been
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:54.720]   sick for seven years may require up to a year to heal right the shorter the illness the quicker
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:50:00.560]   you will heal a rule of thumb to is to use imprinted water for each month of illness a person who's
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:05.920]   been sick for six months will require six months of usage the more toxic the person the longer it
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:10.720]   will take to heal that kind of makes sense now info patty had a very similar take on that and
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:15.840]   it basically they're saying hey it does not matter whether you drink 250 milliliters of ic which is
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:20.400]   you know ic water that's what they call it or one liter so it didn't matter how much you take
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:25.120]   one glass of ic water contains the same amount of information as two classes and that's a really
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:30.160]   good point right at that you know whether you're drinking a glass or a pitcher it's you're still
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:35.440]   taking the same amount of frequency because this is imprinted frequency into water but what's
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:41.520]   important according to info patty is that to drink the water two to three times per day this is because
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:47.360]   we need to periodically supply and influence the water with ic that's the frequencies in order to
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:53.600]   cause an informational effect on the body so there you go it's kind of again it's all over the map
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:59.520]   depends on on you know it really depends but you know from me my perspective is is I make it right
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:04.160]   you know I drink it as I make it and I'm always drinking it I mean my all of my water that I
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:10.240]   drink is imprinted with something so that's kind of my approach to it now in terms of FAQ can I
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:15.520]   replace physical supplements with imprinted water this is a really big subject and this is
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:20.720]   something that's been coming up in our our quantum you know chat groups for a long time
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:28.080]   and so here's the recommendation or the FAQ on that now info patty was the only one to even you
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:33.680]   know touch this subject and they said that the ICs are not substitutes for real substances
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:38.720]   it is usually a good idea to keep real substances as part of the diet however some people may have
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:43.920]   problems related to the substance as difficulty with digestion and absorption allergic reaction
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:49.040]   lack of access just like the taste or smell etc so to ensure people are still able to obtain the
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:55.040]   benefits associated with the substance they can try infosuticles okay so kind of like your FDA
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.320]   safety statement but you know they they're they're not gonna stand on saying hey yeah you can go
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:05.680]   ahead and replace it but you know that was their opinion on it now the only other company that even
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:12.880]   made it made a statement about this in their FAQs with NES health and specifically a question was
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:19.040]   is you know can I replace my medications and the answer was no and infosuticles are meant to help
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:24.960]   clear the human body field and provide healing assistance to needed areas and that's all they're
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:31.920]   going to say so they're also saying no you can't replace the physical supplements physical medications
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:36.080]   with imprinted water so nobody out there is willing to put their neck on the line because
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:41.920]   you can just imagine you know the legal consequences however in my last interview with Richard Jordan
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:47.360]   of new image lifestyles great interview by the way fantastic incredibly smart individual
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:52.800]   now he's an AO scan affiliate which means he's an AO scan subject matter expert now him and his wife
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:59.120]   did a one-year trial the two adults for one year where they had replaced their physical supplements
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:06.160]   we talked about this in the interview with imprinted water okay and so after you know for one year and
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:11.760]   now and and the I want to kind of point out and that Richard's 77 years old and so as you guys
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:17.680]   that you know if you're reaching your older years you know that being that age you know it's kind
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:23.200]   of like if you don't upkeep your health you know regiment you know you fall apart fast you know
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:28.880]   you ain't eating a spring chicken no more and so now so at their age you know him and his wife they
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:35.520]   replaced and stopped taking physical supplements and they only took imprinted water as their supplements
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:41.520]   and they showed no detrimental effect after one year and this is detrimental effect as measured
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:47.520]   by AO scan and instead they actually you know basically experienced positive improvements in
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:53.360]   their health using imprinted water solely and then I think this is the only and I mean I've been
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:54:00.480]   searching for an answer to this question for a long time and you know and in talking with Richard
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:05.680]   about it was fascinating because here's the first time anyone's you know I've heard of anyone
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:10.880]   actually testing it and especially you know testing it at their age but they did it and
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:16.400]   they their year into it so one whole year into it two adults you know it says something now that
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:22.960]   it's not the definitive answer on this question but it is definitely a information point that I
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:27.360]   think everyone should keep in mind and go ahead and listen to that interview if you haven't it's
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:32.000]   a great interview so now so that's the answer to that you know can I replace it well maybe
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.040]   the the people that sell it to you don't want to don't want to commit to the answer but
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:41.040]   but there is an example out there in the world that does exist that shows that it might be you
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:45.920]   know might be a okay thing to do now lastly you know before I go I just want to kind of share
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:50.320]   with you as you probably at you know wondering like what is my approach what do I do exactly and
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:56.960]   I got to start off with a I'm lazy and I always will default to the easiest thing to do I'm like
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:04.400]   water I fall the easiest path and and so what I do and this is my thing is and you know because I
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:08.640]   take physical supplements and after talking to Richard I'm really starting to think maybe I want
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:14.240]   to give that a try you know you know because I literally spend thousands of dollars every year
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:19.440]   on supplements and so after hearing what his experience was I mean I'm like wow okay so I'm
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:26.800]   actually going to start tinkering around with you know replacing physical with imprinted water
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:31.040]   in terms of supplements but for you know for all this time now for years and years and years and
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:38.160]   I've been doing this research for 20 years plus so my kind of like my standard operating procedure
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:43.600]   when it comes to water is you know I have you know first of all I run it through a whole bunch
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:49.360]   of purification processes so I get the absolute cleanest water you can get okay and so then what
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:52.960]   I do is I you know I keep it in the fridge so I've got a couple of these pictures this is an exact
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:57.360]   picture of what I use yeah I know it's plastic but I drink a full one of these a day so it never
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:02.560]   sits in there more than two days and so I fill up a picture and then whenever I fill up a picture
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:08.240]   I do the emoto thing you know the Masaru Emoto thing and you know you got to watch that documentary
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:13.440]   it's fantastic and so I get and I bless the water and I bless the water based on whatever I'm
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:18.480]   feeling that moment okay so sometimes it's love sometimes it's healing sometimes it's whatever
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:23.760]   you know I just life force energy whatever but I bless my water you know and you know I just kind
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:30.960]   of on a on a little tiny side note you know there's a reason why all of our cultural practices going
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:36.240]   back as far as we any of us can remember there's a reason for the concept of blessing and I'm not
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:40.880]   getting into religion I'm talking about just simply blessing like you know like why did all
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:45.360]   the ancients and you know like why did we grow up with our grandparents you know saying grace at
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:51.360]   the table you know all of these concepts of blessing the food and the water that you eat
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:57.680]   here we go Amaro is you know Masaru Emoto proved hey man that makes a difference and so that's kind
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:02.720]   of what I do I just as a practice I fill up the picture and before I put it in the fridge I bless
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:08.320]   the water okay and I use and I use that technique using consciousness and then the next thing I do
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:14.320]   is after I pour a glass of water I use a magnet as a coaster and so I just sit it on the magnet
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:19.120]   North Pole facing up and it just sits there so not only do I have the the conscious blessing of
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:24.160]   whatever love or whatever in the water but it's sitting there and I'm energizing with North Pole
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:28.800]   water now so those of you guys asking well geez you know you know for people who know me you know
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:33.760]   I own like six or seven blocks and it's like well you know I don't want to why aren't you using
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:39.680]   your block well it's because it's like I'm lazy and it takes three minutes and so so I do it but
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:44.560]   I do charge my water every now and then you know when I've got time I'll put the picture in the
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:50.160]   quantum block and in fact I actually made I actually made my own quotes you know like I
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:55.440]   forgot what I named it I named it like something something water but I actually made a water
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:58:01.200]   frequency and you know and just kind of a hint you know I a friend of mine you know who you are
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:07.840]   out there you know sent me the frequency on a Lima water and I took that and I took frequencies
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:13.280]   from like you know deuterium depleted water and hydrogen water and browns gas water and all of
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:18.880]   these wonderful waters and and all these positive stuff and I made a frequency set that I call my
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:23.440]   water frequency and I will then you know every now and then when you know when I've got you know I
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:28.320]   just you know I have time I'll actually put the picture and I'll put the frequency card in there
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:33.600]   and I'll charge my water that I'm going to be drinking with my you know you know calmers water
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:38.960]   frequency and I'll embed all of that wonderful stuff into that water and so but you know these
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:42.400]   are the three different things that I do and I do it depending on how wherever I'm feeling that
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:48.560]   day but that's what I do so I definitely I'm all my waters imprinted one way or another or
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:53.440]   multiple different ways and that's how I do it and that's what works for me all right so otherwise

[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:24.000]   just as an example my I use metal water bowls for my dogs and I have charged all of those bowls
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:30.560]   with the vitamins you know I buy dog vitamins and so I took all the dog vitamins and and and I
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:36.080]   imprinted the dog vitamins into that bowl and so when the water sitting in that metal bowl the
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:42.240]   frequencies will imprint onto the water so I'm always serving my dogs imprinted water as well so
