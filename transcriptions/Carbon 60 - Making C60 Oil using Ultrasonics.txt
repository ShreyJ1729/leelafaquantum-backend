[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   Hi and welcome back to the Carbon 60 series. I'm Kay Elmer and this is going to be a little short video
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.600]   I just wanted to give everybody a heads up on my experiences with making C60 oil using an ultrasound and cleaner
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.840]   I was quite the escapade yesterday and I just wanted to share with you what I did so that you could kind of see it
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.680]   I know I've had several people inquire as to how it went and I know that you're interested. So here we go
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.920]   First thing right out of the gate. This is what I used. I went with a cold-pressed organic coconut oil
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.240]   Used 16 ounces that only cost me five dollars and then as I mentioned in the last video part three
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:45.280]   I used the 99.95% purity C60 from Bucky Labs and it sells for 110 grams
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.600]   So I use half a gram at 500 milligrams is 55 bucks. So my total ingredients cost was $60
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.600]   To go ahead and make this batch. Now at this
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.880]   Math at 16 ounces it comes out to the total amount of fullerenes and oil in the same
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:10.920]   Jar was it should have been if it would have completely dissolved it would have been 1.06 milligrams per milliliter
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.800]   But as you remember from everything I've been saying the the actual saturation rate in the rad study and with most of the
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.000]   Commercial grade producers is 0.8 milligrams per milliliter. I went with a little bit more
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.320]   because
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.680]   My digital scale was not working. So I had to eyeball it
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:38.600]   So now what I did was is I sterilized the ultrasound and cleaner with boiling water for five minutes to make sure it was super clean
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.520]   And nothing living and then I heated on the stove 16 ounces of coconut oil
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.080]   And I placed it in the sterilized cleaner after that I added in the 500 milligrams of the C60 powder
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.400]   I stirred it up and then I ran it for a total of 94 minutes as it's a weird number
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.840]   I'd show I was shooting for a hundred but I went with 94 and then I'll tell you why in a second
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.360]   And then while it because the ultrasound and cleaner only has a timer that goes so far
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.240]   Every time the timer would run out. I would stir it up again turn the timer on stir it up again
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.080]   turn the timer on and stir it up. So that's kind of how it went last night and
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.280]   This is the results that I actually ended up with oh, I'm sorry. These are the issues that I ran into first the issues
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.520]   The first thing was was I remember I bought one of these guys. I got it on eBay
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.120]   30 bucks and you know had good reviews and everything and that thing just stopped running
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.800]   I mean I ran it for 30 minutes and boom it just died
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.920]   And I was so frustrated and so I pulled out this little guy
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.180]   Which is what I make vitamin C liposomal vitamin C with and I had to move and I had to pour the oil over
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.920]   Into the little jewelry cleaner
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.760]   And I think that while I sterilize it first and I put it poured it in there
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.880]   And then this guy goes for 30 minutes out of shot
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.560]   But this guy only goes the little guy only goes eight minutes out of shot
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.360]   So I had to just do it for eight times. I had to keep going back
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.160]   You know every eight minutes. I go back stir it up turn it on stir it
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.840]   You know it was it was really a lot of fun actually, don't let me tell you
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.800]   So anyway, so had I just had the big one
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.440]   I could have just set the timer three separate times and and just let it run a little one
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.400]   I had to really babysit so I did end up using two this guy for the first 30 minutes
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.680]   This guy for 64 minutes and that's how I ended up with that weird number
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.240]   And the last thing as I mentioned that my digital, you know, it's just one of those days
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.280]   I I go to turn on the digital meter and it's not working. I put new batteries in
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.800]   It's just it's not working
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.440]   For you that don't you know for the guys that don't know I live in who I am half a mile from the ocean
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.600]   Are you know our electronics don't last very long and I was quite surprised that I didn't have a digital meter
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.360]   So I had that little vial of this c60 powder and I had to eyeball it
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.680]   And so I dumped in half what was in there
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.560]   Uh, and that's kind of how I'm coming out with my guesses
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.600]   So I want to just give you a disclaimer. I was guessing
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.960]   I didn't have a meter. So my numbers are
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.800]   Estimates, okay, so that's it. So let me just kind of just show you
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.280]   uh how it went
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.800]   Uh
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.560]   From a visual standpoint, so that's the little guy after I'd moved the oil over
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.600]   And this was just after the first 30 minutes, okay
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.920]   So the oil was really light light light lavender and you can see the fullerenes as the machine is
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.720]   You know making that sound you can see how the oil is moving. That's from the ultrasonic waves
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.360]   But what was interesting was that the fullerenes would kind of form this little weird pattern on the bottom
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.280]   Um, but I would just let it run it would just let it run for 480 seconds
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.200]   Which is here as you're seeing the the countdown
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.600]   And I just stir it up and stir it up and just try to keep the whole thing going
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.960]   Now what this is is after the full 64 minutes the hour long later
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.640]   Um, I
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.000]   This is what this is what it looked like and it had went from a light lavender to a dark
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.480]   Lavender, I mean a really rich color
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.120]   Um, and so I went took it out of this cleaner and this is the residue
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.760]   And so you know without a digital meter, I didn't know exactly how much you put in there
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.480]   But also too, I don't have the equipment to measure it
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.440]   So the way that I'm doing it and I'm sure you're doing it too at home
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.360]   Is you're going to have to eyeball the the color of the oil to see how much darker did it get
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.800]   And then look inside your cleaner and then you're going to get this oil. Look at this oil right here
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.560]   This is what I produced
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.160]   Uh after you know basically 94 minutes and it is
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.080]   Purple, I mean it is exactly the same look
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.640]   As the when I when I first started doing this I started with purple power and that's the bottle
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.320]   I use I save my bottles and and so you know when when you look at what's left over, I'm guessing
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.040]   That I probably left about 40 percent of the fullerenes in the cleaner
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.920]   But if you look at the oil, it is definitely dark purple. It does look like I mean
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.440]   There's definitely um
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.560]   Fullerenes that had dissolved into the oil. I definitely made
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.880]   Lipole fullerenes. It is not exactly what I'd hope to do
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.200]   Which was 0.8 milligrams per milliliter because if you look at that and you eyeball it
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.720]   You know, I'm kind of guessing like I left 40 percent of the fullerenes in the in the cleaner at the bottom
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.600]   But at least 60 percent and these are all guesses now
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.240]   Okay
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:26.120]   But I'm guessing that at least 60 percent of the powder dissolved given the color of that because before I started that
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.800]   That was clear
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.160]   Okay, the coconut oil is clear. So it definitely did dissolve. I'm I'm pretty sure I got more than half
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.520]   dissolved into the oil
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.640]   Right and I made myself a batch and you know, I was I just showing you right there that it was uh
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.920]   Still warm to the touch. So with that in mind
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.560]   Look
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.240]   The idea here is that you know, this is what I think at the end of the day
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.680]   That I actually I think I dissolved and this is an estimate
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.720]   60 percent of the oil and that would have came out to about 0.63 milligrams per milliliter
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:08.760]   Okay. So in my estimation, uh, I did make lipo fullerenes with a little machine that meant to clean jewelry of all things
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.120]   Okay
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:16.600]   And I did it in 94 minutes and it came out to a little bit less than the commercial grade
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.920]   So I'm going to call this home grade lipo fullerene for 60 dollars
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.240]   As opposed to commercial grade lipo fullerenes and the same bottle, which was you know, that's 16 ounce bottle
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:33.080]   So right after the video I poured the uh, the contents into the you know, my my did jar
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:38.280]   I mean the bottle that I I bought and that bottle right now sells for 370 dollars. So
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:44.120]   Home grade for 60 buy it off the shelf for 370. It's it's i'm garens
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.840]   It's not the same saturation level, but you know, I'm kind of a good enough
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.880]   Home lab guy. So, you know, that's just by the way. This is the first time
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.240]   This is my first experiment using an ultrasonic trying to make
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.680]   Lipo fullerene. So I think for the first experiment with all the things that went wrong
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:09.160]   I'm pretty happy and so i'm glad i'm actually taking it. I took some this morning and i'm, you know, doing my thing
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.520]   Now the other things that i'm going to be going off and making some more
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.200]   I'm going to be doing other kinds of like, you know experiments and i'm thinking about
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.880]   What would happen if I lowered the temperature because I had it really hot
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.080]   Um and what and then I was thinking what if I stirred it overnight because as while i'm doing this coconut thing
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:31.400]   I've also got a half a liter of or of olive oil fullerene spinning on the magnetic stir
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.280]   You know, the dog takes the olive oil. I take the coconut
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.040]   So i'm thinking, you know, if I stir it overnight because well, I was really surprised with this
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.760]   With the beaker that's sitting on the magnetic stir
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.760]   Because that thing was the oil was light green and I checked at the next morning and it was black and I was like
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.240]   I was very surprised that we got that dark that quick
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.720]   So i'm thinking well, maybe if I stirred overnight and then put it in the ultrasonic cleaner
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.680]   It might be better. So i'll be trying that next and then you know, what if I added more c60
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:04.680]   So i'm just thinking out loud i'm brainstorming i'm sharing with you what happened what I did what what the results were
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.280]   I know you guys are trying this at home. I'd love to hear how your experiments went
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:13.480]   And uh, that's it quick video. Thanks a lot. I really appreciate your guys support
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.440]   I read all your comments and I am so humbled. I really am. I'm just really humbled
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:24.760]   And how much you guys appreciate what the work i'm trying to share with you and i'm just going to keep going and
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.160]   Thanks a lot for your support. Thanks for your time. Have a great day
