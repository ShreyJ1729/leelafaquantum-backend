[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.680]   Kay Elmer and this video is another installment in the series. Welcome to
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.400]   Layla Q otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech and what these video series is for
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.080]   is for new customers and existing customers to cover the most common
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.960]   questions that pop up in our telegram chat groups
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.400]   as to where to get help you know what the differences are between the services
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.000]   and the products and and on and on. Now this video specifically
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.840]   is how to use the frequencies. So the first thing I want to kind of convey
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.400]   is that part of Layla Quantum Tech there's two big things happening with
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.040]   Layla Quantum Tech and then if you kind of understand the nomenclature of this
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.360]   kind of stuff. One is energy, energy medicine, energy
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.280]   healing and all that energy stuff right but then they're also doing what's
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.400]   also known as vibrational medicine are also known as
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.360]   frequency medicine so there's two different modalities
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.200]   at play here so you can just get quantum energy and you know it's just boosting
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.280]   up your life force, energy kind of thing or you can also kind of play with the
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.920]   frequencies. Now the frequencies come in two different
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.600]   flavors and one flavor is you know through the quantum upgrade you can have
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.720]   different frequencies you know you know broadcast to you
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.680]   or whatever object you've chosen to subscribe
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.600]   and then in the in the physical world you can carry around a card or a capsule
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.680]   and have that frequency vibrate you know near you and then you can expose
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.600]   yourself to that way. So those are the two ways to experience the frequencies
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.480]   but the most common question that I see in the telegram chat groups is
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.640]   what frequency do I use for what right and so what I wanted to kind of do is
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.560]   make it a little bit simpler than how it's currently on the site so that you
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.000]   can kind of just you know maybe just you know save yourself some time
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.280]   I tried to make it as you know kind of just more user-friendly than the way it
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.040]   is now and the way it is now is on the product side
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.480]   you know when you go to pick out a frequency it's just a big long list of
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.640]   frequencies and then there's a separate 20 something page PDF
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.120]   that just gives you the description of each one
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.560]   or if you're on the website and you click on a particular frequency
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.840]   under product description you can read what that frequency is but it's just
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.960]   this really long list I think there's well over 30
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.200]   frequencies at this point. Now on the on the upgrade side
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.280]   what Layla's done is they've broken the frequencies into different bundles
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.720]   so you've got the abundant bundle the heel bundle the source bundle there's a
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.840]   booster bundle which is the ones I created and then there's an animal
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.800]   bundle so they kind of broke it into five different categories
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.640]   and then they kind of like you know basically categorized them in this
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.480]   manner okay but one of the things about this manner is it still
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.800]   ends up you know basically creating a lot of questions because people are always
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.920]   asking well you know because it's not really clear
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.600]   you know what do I do you know like which frequency do I use for what
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.200]   you know because the word source doesn't really mean anything honestly and
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.800]   abundance is just one specific frequency it's not all other ones
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.520]   in there and boosters you know what is a booster right so
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.040]   so what I kind of try to do here in this videos and and there's going to be an
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.320]   accompanying PDF there's a link to that in the video
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.960]   description that comes with that I'll be walking you
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.920]   through the PDF but I think that there's a better
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.000]   alternative way to categorize these frequencies to make it a lot user-friendly
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.840]   and and just really make it easy for everyone to kind of decide what to do
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.120]   so there's a basic premise here that I want to convey
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.880]   and that is there's three basic categories in my mind how these frequencies
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.080]   should be categorized and the first one is is
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.600]   health you know does it have to do with your physical health your biology
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.360]   you know your biology right and so if it has to do with your health
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.840]   it has to do with the performance of your health
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.600]   then I think that that is a category the other one is healing if there's
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.880]   something wrong with your health then you're going to want to heal that and to
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.520]   me that's a separate another category then the third one is is manifesting
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.760]   these are things that you want to bring into your life
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.520]   or like you know you want the vibration of you want your home to vibrate
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.480]   at you know at happiness that sort of thing so there's really
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.800]   in my mind there's three separate categories not you know instead of
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.160]   bundles I look at it like three separate categories
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.640]   and then if you're on quantum upgrade and you say well
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.640]   if I have the u subscription you know which one of these three categories
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.160]   apply well that all three of them apply you can definitely because you are you
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.360]   know you the human would definitely want to work on your health and
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.320]   performance you know like cognitive performance
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.680]   physical performance and on top of just your general health
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.640]   and then of course if there's a healing issue if you're in pain you got
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.880]   something wrong an illness or disease and you need healing help
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.280]   then there's healing and then of course you want to manifest stuff you want to
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.160]   bring stuff into your life prosperity abundance
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.400]   and that's all manifesting so definitely these three categories apply to
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.440]   you under the u subscription and of course you
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.560]   if you buy the card you're carrying it around or you're wearing the capsule
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.240]   or even if you put you know a frequency in your block and you're broadcasting it
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.600]   throughout your home or entangling it with you with a photo so
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.240]   that's how you would experience those three
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.840]   or you know the frequencies in general in three different ways
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.320]   so now back to the quantum upgrade now if I had a location subscription
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.840]   then if you think of your location and you think of your car
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.760]   it's a place right your car is a place i'm in my car i'm
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.440]   in my home right so then honestly you know your health
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.080]   and healing they don't really apply to that
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.560]   because the your home is the concept of home your car is a physical thing
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.680]   your home and property is a giant space and the question that
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.600]   a lot of people ask is like hey if i'm in my home
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.160]   and all of the family members are in there
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.040]   and i broadcast let's say heal does everybody in there get heal
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.440]   technically the home the vibration of the home is experiencing
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.720]   the healing frequency and then while everybody's in it yes they are
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   you know kind of like tangentially right but here's the problem with
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.120]   sending heal and healthy and i'm sorry health and healing frequencies
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.680]   to a location is that because it's so personalized to the
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.600]   specific individual experiencing whatever they're experiencing
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.960]   that you know if you send that type of a frequency into a home
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.440]   and not everybody's on the same page then you know it's not gonna really help
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.680]   the whole group you know in other words a one person who's like let's say in
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.040]   pain and there's pain frequency being sent to the home
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.240]   well the other people in the home you know they're not in pain
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.640]   and it really won't help them you know i mean it's not going to do anything
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.280]   right if they're not in pain so that's just the concept that i'm
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.800]   trying to convey here is that in my personal opinion and all of this
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.440]   is my opinion by the way is that you know locations and car is better
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.280]   suited for manifesting you know like what are like what what kind of vibe do i
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.480]   want to have in my house what kind of vibe do i want to have when
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.320]   i'm in my car and i think that's just you know and businesses as well
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.360]   because a business definitely doesn't have a
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.560]   physical biology you know biology health issue and it certainly doesn't have a
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.560]   biological healing issue so businesses cars and
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.840]   location subscription i think are more suited
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.320]   to the manifesting frequencies right and if you have a health and healing
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.400]   then it's you should get a u subscription now i do you know again you know i do
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.440]   know that people want to just kind of like get a home and treat everybody
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.680]   but treating everybody does not really you know it just doesn't work
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.640]   because different people are different levels and different spaces and
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.040]   all that stuff and you know different uh every different everything actually
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.840]   so that's that now the other thing about the
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.640]   different frequencies are now if you have a phone that's now that the phone is
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.960]   a little bit different it's not a place it's a thing
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.400]   and because we carry our phones around with us all the time
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.600]   i i kind of just feel that it's like the same as a u
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.280]   so if you had a phone subscription or a u subscription i and you want to play
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.000]   with the frequencies i would treat them the exact same way
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.600]   because the phone is you because who doesn't have their phone
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.280]   near them all the time right so you know so that's and then the phone has a
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.640]   field and you're going to be in that field so it's pretty much the same as
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.240]   you in fact you know you know you really don't need a phone if you have a u you
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.440]   don't need a phone subscription because you are you right
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.960]   and then the other thing too are there's pets there's frequencies for pets
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.480]   and that's a separate category and definitely there's health and healing
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.680]   frequencies that go with them and then there's health and healing frequencies
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.360]   for plants okay so again you know if you had
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.120]   if you have like a large farm and you want to treat the farm
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.800]   with you know like heal for plants uh then you know you put the location
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.080]   there you sign up you know actually i'm sorry you can't do upgrade for
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.880]   plants you only can do it with a physical block
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.800]   but the same idea let me just go back and i'll just do this analogy with pets
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.920]   you have pets in your home and yeah could you send
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.240]   your home you know like to heal for dogs frequency uh yeah but you're kind of
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.280]   wasting the opportunity there because why don't you just sign up the pet as a
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.480]   pet subscription and not send pet frequencies to your
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.080]   home and instead use that opportunity if you have your home
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.640]   use that opportunity to like you know have your home vibrate with inner peace
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.240]   or have your home vibrate for happiness i mean those are the kind of things you
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.560]   know i that's how i look at it i want my home to vibrate at a certain vibe
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.600]   you know and if i want to do something with my pet you know i got a subscription
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.640]   just for those two guys uh and that sort of thing okay so
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.120]   just keep that in mind that's kind of how i'm looking at it
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.920]   now uh just as an fyi i just you know i did uh i do want to try start doing
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.840]   slides in both english and german for german friends over there in europe
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.720]   so here's the same information here in the german language
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.920]   and then also to in the handout so now this is the the table that i've created
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.600]   that's in the quick reference guide and i've expanded it a little bit and
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.440]   to kind of just convey those three concepts of health heal and manifest
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.880]   and so now for the lay the cue frequencies the first thing and this is
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.240]   going to be in that uh you know that downloadable pdf
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.560]   for the for you guys to you know access but the idea here is that there's
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.000]   multiple columns and so here's a list of all of the different frequencies
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.920]   that are available uh and then if it comes on a card
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.840]   and or if it comes in quantum upgrades you can see there's some blot
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.280]   their blanks here so there are some frequencies are on a card
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.480]   and not on quantum upgrade and then there's some frequencies that are on
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.160]   quantum upgrade and not on a card so that's what these two columns are
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.360]   just the x's just say hey this is where you know how you can access the
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.680]   frequency now here in terms of health what i've
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.040]   tried to do is just basically with an x
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.720]   categorize which frequencies go towards health
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.360]   which freak you know to you as a person that you would want to
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.720]   either you know use for yourself use for your phone or you know again if you
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.920]   have a physical object such as a block or a capsule
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.920]   these are the kind of frequencies that are great and are designed for
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.080]   you so here's your health this is all about your biology i call these in my
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.440]   mind the biologics and so these are like the biologics these are things that
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.000]   are actually going to be doing things for you
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.240]   so you know like focus is a cognitive thing calm and rest right detox
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.920]   DNA support you know so that's what all of these different frequencies here on
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.440]   this column of health where you see an x then that's an
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.520]   actual frequency design for your biology okay and this is what you would prefer
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.240]   i mean this is what you would use you know like if you know for weight
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.120]   management so forth right you know your business doesn't need weight management
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.920]   but you know so it's going to apply to your health and so and then all of this
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.600]   is just to make things fast and simple and easy for you to use okay
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.280]   now in the world of healing and this is the number one question
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.360]   always people jump into the telegram chat group and go i have this or my
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.760]   family member has this issue what frequencies the best one so that's
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.520]   where you get into um like how do you help this person
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.440]   from a quantum healing standpoint actually it's actually not quantum healing
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.360]   it's this category is vibrational medicine so how do you help them with
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.000]   like you know vibrational medicine uh you know a work right and so this is
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.880]   when you would use frequencies and so that's when you need to look
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.520]   undergoing well you know what's really that person's
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.720]   issue and what are the available frequencies and so obviously there's
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.560]   there's the pain one the the newest ones are the pain one
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.760]   and the heal 360 so right off the bat if you've got
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.400]   any issue you know someone that you want to help
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.600]   and they've got problems if they're in pain use the pain one
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.720]   if they're just having a problem use the heal 360
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.520]   and that's really well i mean heal 360 was such
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.120]   a great frequency that was the result of the contest i had that we had
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.640]   or they had earlier this year that they actually you know they made a
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.600]   product out of it now there's a capsule for heal 360
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.920]   it's that credible of a of a frequency so if you have someone who's suffering
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.680]   from xyz then heal 360 is where i would go
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.040]   if you just know that they've gotten inflammatory issues like
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.680]   you know they spray their ankle and they're all swelled up then that's a
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.600]   specific one for inflammation of course you know for healing you know
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.960]   there's less emotional healing if someone's going through a really tough
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.520]   event in their life the inner piece is a great
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.280]   healing frequency for that so you can see where there are frequencies that cover
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.160]   both worlds okay and so you've got resurrection
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.520]   resurrection is a trauma-based frequency it helps you release trauma
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.800]   trauma is tied to physical ailments sometimes releasing trauma
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.280]   will actually cure physical problems and it's true
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.480]   seasonal support again that's if you're you know you're suffering from allergies
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.440]   which i want to just make sure that you know allergies meaning
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.880]   you know hay fever outside pollen that kind of thing
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.560]   not to be construed as allergies like food intolerances and that sort of thing
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.000]   hold another subject video on that okay so but anyway so if you've got
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.920]   allergies you need to heal from that you're
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.920]   you're suffering from a problem then you're going to want to use one of these
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.520]   heal frequencies not to be confused with the word heal
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.560]   or the acronym heal which is Layla's copyright
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.480]   okay so then now the last one is the manifest i talked about manifesting
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.320]   so this is where you know it's not biologic it's completely
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.480]   vibe thing so you want to like bring into your home
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.040]   into your life and you can apply this to you all right you can easily you know
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.800]   you can definitely apply this to yourself you want to bring this into your life
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.720]   so any one of these manifesting ones you could do it's just a separate
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.680]   category as opposed to being a biological thing
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:58.640]   it's a manifesting thing you want to bring this into your life
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.840]   or you want your home business whatever to kind of vibrate
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.840]   at this kind of level bringing abundance you know this whole forever young
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.560]   thing freeing your mind if you actually read the
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.600]   descriptions of each one of these and you just take the word out
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.520]   the word you out and put your business it just
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.480]   perfectly reads you know like oh yeah i want my business to do that
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.440]   i want my business to have better you know everyone getting along better and
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.480]   and i want my business you know business to you know be more unified
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.040]   than that all that stuff so it kind of actually applies quite well
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.960]   so there's gratitude there's happiness and of course the lay live frequency
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:38.480]   multi-dimensional free protection self-love is actually quite quite a
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.320]   good manifestation for relationship issues and unity and that sort of thing
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.000]   so that is how i have categorized is for a
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.680]   quick at a glance what would be the best frequency
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.000]   to use for x right whether i want to have a physical problem
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.440]   or a physical issue you know i have a physical thing i want to address like
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.040]   my weight or a physical issue i want to address that
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.400]   is a problem i want to fix uh or you know at least treat
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.960]   and then of course i want to manifest something into my life
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.480]   now the next page here on this pdf is going to be where
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.280]   there's of course they lay the frequencies for animals there's five
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.840]   different animals frequencies that are available
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.480]   horses cats dogs and just in general and so if you got a kind of hyperactive pet
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.120]   definitely the calm for animals would be a great one
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.880]   it's for their health just calm them down and so forth so now there of course
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.440]   there's both they double as the heel for dogs cats and horses
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.600]   does you know they do double for both a good it's a great frequency for just
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.840]   general health and then of course if they've got a
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.800]   physical issue you want to heal them then you could you know that's a great
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.800]   frequency to just play all the time i've got an older dog and he's got knee
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.080]   problems and he's running heel for dogs 21 so
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.360]   and then of course there's heel for plants now this is again just on a physical
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.040]   card but it's it's all just the same as with animals it's both
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:00.320]   for healing and for health okay so with plants uh you know i i've
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.400]   actually you know charge different things and stuck them in pots and they all
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.520]   have the heel for plants frequency and that's how that works now
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.120]   the second the third and fourth pages are the exact same content for you german
