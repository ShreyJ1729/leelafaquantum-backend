[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another video by me K. Elmer and in this video I
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.200]   would like to share with you something very very unique and very special and
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.040]   in its infancy of getting the word out to the world about what this is all
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.560]   about it is just really the most surprising thing I've run across since I
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.400]   ran across C60 two years ago and I just have been researching this doing a
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.400]   very deep dive for the last couple of months and doing a month of
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.560]   experimenting on my own and I just wanted to put this together to share
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.520]   with you what I've learned so far which is pretty much the theme of my my
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.640]   YouTube channel here. What I'm talking about is a substance called Brown's Gas.
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.200]   It's also known as HHO and it's been primarily used in the welding industry
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:04.160]   since the 70s and it's it's it's entry into the health and wellness space is
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.520]   very recent there is not a tremendous amount of research being done on it up
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.920]   till now and it's it's very much very very new it's like you know just it's so
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.360]   interesting how it replicates the interest in C60 so it's something that I
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.720]   just kind of stumbled across actually and I just really really just have just
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.920]   very very surprised that the results that I've gotten and and with my
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.600]   experience with Brown's Gas and the question here that I'm putting forward
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.880]   to everybody is is this better than carbon 60s so let me share with you what
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.440]   I've learned and what I've been experimenting with and the results that I
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.000]   have and then you know chime in let me let me hear what you got to think now
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.560]   this video is part of my electrohealing series as opposed to the carbon 60 series
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.440]   because it takes electricity to generate Brown's gas and what Brown's gas does is
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.560]   it affects your the energy of your body with the whole concept of electrons and
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.960]   protons and let me go ahead and I'll get into that in a moment but for you folks
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:21.280]   that are interested in C60 and are and are actively in taking C60 and you know
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.360]   that C60 is an electron donor and it's a super antioxidant way do you hear what
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.840]   Brown's Gas can do for you so it's gonna get a little science nerdy here for a
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.560]   few minutes please bear with me but if you follow along you'll understand the
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.400]   progression of the information I'm about to present so first things first let's
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.680]   jump right in disclaimers the statements made in this video have not been evaluated

[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.200]   material discussed in this video is theoretical and conclusive evidence
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.720]   remains to be published so for those of you who'd like to comment about things
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.040]   that I say that aren't proven science yes I know it's theoretical so let's bear
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.920]   with me and come for the road and cover the right okay so the very first thing
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.640]   that I just want to do a real quick intro what is hydrogen and the and the
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.440]   reason that I even got into hydrogen to begin with them specifically molecular
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.760]   hydrogen and its health benefits okay so first of all you know it's start all
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.120]   started with C60 a couple years ago you know the recommendation at the time was
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.800]   say Eden Apple after you take C60 because the hydrogen works really well with C60
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.360]   blah blah blah blah and the next thing you know almost everybody I know that was
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.480]   taking C60 started also drinking hydrogen water from one of those little bottle
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.440]   things or taking the tablets and so forth and so it became kind of this
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.160]   really good combination and people found out that they really did work well
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.520]   together because they're both super antioxidants but you know let's start
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.400]   with what is hydrogen which is you know how I got into hydrogen so what is
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.480]   hydrogen well it's basically if you look at the periodic table it is the
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.160]   smallest and lightest element on the entire periodic table it is only
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.640]   comprised of one electron one proton and when you look at the human body and you
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.160]   break it down to its atomic particles what's really interesting is that the
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.320]   human body is 64 percent hydrogen and 24 percent oxygen now of course you
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.200]   combine those two and what do you have is you have H2O and we all know that we
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.080]   are literally walking saltwater aquariums right you're most average human beings
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.200]   are like an 11 half gallon saltwater aquarium I mean you're just all water
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.720]   pretty much and then there's 12 percent carbon we all know that and then there's
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.040]   two percent others all the other minerals that compose all the hard the
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.840]   hard parts of your body but you know the thing is is we're we're the majority of
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.240]   us is of our bodies is hydrogen so when you think about taking hydrogen as a
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.040]   supplement and how do you get hydrogen in your food in your area you know it's
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.720]   you really start getting deep into the whole concept of hydrogen and finding
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.480]   out you know how important it really is and it's really overlooked I think I
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.240]   think it's very overlooked in maintaining our health is the concept of taking in
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.560]   hydrogen so real quick science lesson here how is H2 produced to you know to
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.040]   provide as a supplement and well first of all H2 is the hydrogen atom which is
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.720]   one proton one electron and combined together to form to form two hydrogen
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.040]   atoms forms hydrogen gas so H2 is two hydrogen atoms and that's H2 it
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.280]   represents the hydrogen gas and so how it's produced and if you have one of
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.200]   those little bottles and actually made a video about those bottles and this
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.360]   membrane called the PEM membrane and some of those older bottles the cheap
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.200]   bottles don't have this membrane and they produce all sorts of weird chemicals
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.600]   and things and is not good for you and then I the video I had said well you know
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.320]   it's not good for you but not worse for you than tap water that was the outcome
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.520]   of that one video but I this is like the third video in hydrogen I've done so but
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.880]   but this puppy your basic hydrogen bottle set up or your hydrogen machine
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.280]   whatever you've got is that you've got this membrane usually a PEM membrane it
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.080]   takes the H2O the water that it's that it says you put you fill it with water
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.480]   and then you just turn on you just do an electrolyzer you've got an anode and a
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.960]   cathode positive negative you put an electrical charge into the water separated
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.360]   by a membrane and on the anode side the plus side is gonna be producing oxygen
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.400]   and oxygen comes out one side and then hydrogen it breaks apart that H2O thing
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.680]   and the oxygen goes one side hydrogen goes the other side and the H2 gas gets
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.720]   broken off from the H2O O goes this way H2 goes this way follow the green arrow
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.000]   and then basically this comes out and then you would then this bubbles into
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.840]   water that you would drink the hydrogen water or if you have a machine for a
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.040]   hydrogen inhalation you'll be breathing hydrogen gas through the machine okay
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.600]   and that's just really as simply as it gets it's just an electrolyzer in water
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.520]   and so now what are the health benefits of just regular old molecular hydrogen
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.360]   well this is the one thing that's not theoretical there's actually I mean
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.880]   hundreds and hundreds of science studies on the effects of hydrogen and and and
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.240]   why it works how it works what does it do it's actually being used today in
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.120]   hospitals because it is got some remarkable health benefits of just basic
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.360]   hydrogen gas first of all that's a super antioxidant when you start taking a
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.280]   look at some of the most popular antioxidants that people take for
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.080]   supplementation you know you're looking at Q10 look how big this thing is 863 atoms
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.080]   in this giant molecule even vitamin C has 176 atoms that forms this molecule of
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.080]   vitamin C so it's quite large and you get down into the carbon 60 here 60
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.480]   carbon atoms formed into a sphere to form the carbon 60 molecule that's one
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:02.400]   nanometer in in size which is like one nanometer if you took carbon 60 this
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.840]   little molecule and you lined it side by side and formed a line it would take
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:13.640]   100,000 carbon 60 molecules to form the width of the average human hair that's
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.760]   how small these things are but take a look at this hydrogen only has two just
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.560]   two atoms and it is literally the smallest thing in in our universe right
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.360]   now that we know of you know in terms of atoms okay there's quarks and all those
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.160]   other things let's not go there so and so the whole item idea here is that it's
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.960]   literally the smallest one it's way smaller than carbon 60 and what makes it
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.320]   really unique is because of its size and because of what it does so it it
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.560]   basically here's the health benefits it reduces inflammation hydrogen gas
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.520]   reduces risk of metabolic syndrome it provides neural protection for various
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.440]   diseases and types and types of cranial injuries it reduces side effects
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.320]   associated with cancer radiation treatment prevents liver damage for
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.920]   diabetic patients it reduces the effects from Parkinson's and every one of these
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.640]   statements is made and you can go find some studies for it I'll tell you where
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:09.960]   to go find them too so hydrogen is very molecular hydrogen there is a lot of
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.280]   data it's a lot of science all out there super super good for you and so
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.920]   there's been a hydrogen industry going on for a long time you know and that's
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.400]   where you know and that's how it got tight into C60 and and where those
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.040]   industry have produced commercial products is you know these little bottles
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.440]   that people buy or you take tablets now I had one of these bottles that I found
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.320]   out it didn't have the membrane and it made chlorine and I didn't I don't like
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.960]   the taste of it so it's you know no worse than tap water but I don't like to
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.640]   drink chlorine in tap water anyway so I just kind of threw my bottles away and
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.080]   I've been using these tablets the Viva tablets and the h2 elite tablets and
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.480]   that's actually how I've been taking hydrogen for a couple years now just
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.440]   using the the tablets you know and it works out just fine that's I mean a
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.880]   video on that too and then if you know other folks will get these pictures and
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.080]   the electrolyzers are sitting inside there and they split the water and they
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.560]   bubble the h2 through the pitcher and you drink the water you've seen these
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.160]   things these water cangan type of machines Jupiter machines and they also
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.760]   they produce quote alkaline water but they also create hydrogen in there so
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.240]   you're drinking hydrogen water and these and then the water actually just comes
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.360]   right out the spout it's not a bubbler you can't breathe it but then you've got
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.920]   these machines over here which are actually hydrogen inhalation machines
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.520]   that produce hydrogen gas that you can then put the bubbler you know put a
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.560]   bubbler on the end of the tube and stick it in water to create hydrogen water or
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.840]   take the the tube stick it up you know I'm not sticking up your nose but put a
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.160]   cannula on it and then you could just breathe it too so it's an inhalation
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.560]   slash bubbler and then and then that these that's what these things do and so
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.360]   these are all the different products that are out there to support all of the
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.920]   different science that's going on and people have been benefiting from hydrogen
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.040]   for quite a while now I'm and that's it that's about hydrogen now okay so and I
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.600]   just for more information about hydrogen you know these are two guys that have
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:03.160]   done a tremendous awesome superior body of work it's Tyler LeBaron for the
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.480]   Molecular Hydrogen Institute you can Google him YouTube that guys tons of
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.400]   different great interviews awesome site there's like if you want to look up
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.280]   hydrogen studies this is the site you go to links all in the video description
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.560]   and then there's Taiwan Hubbard on YouTube and he's got the H2 minutes
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.760]   YouTube channel and he's just got tons of videos about how fantastic hydrogen
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:30.400]   gas is for you and drinking hydrogen water so by all means hydrogen is awesome
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.380]   but this video is about Brown's gas but I just wanted to give you the the
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:40.080]   groundwork here how great is hydrogen and is there something better and then
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.580]   let's bring in Yule Brown so now Yule Brown which is what the gas was named
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:50.280]   after because he submitted the patents for it a Bulgarian born Australian
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:56.320]   national born in 22 died recently 1998 he was a trained electrical engineer in
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.720]   a professor from Australian University he basically as an electrical engineer
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.720]   tinkered around with trying to improve the efficiency of welding equipment and
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.240]   welding fuel and he's all about welding now okay that's why this is so uniquely
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.120]   different about Brown's gas is it hasn't really been looked at as a health
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.680]   remedy until just these most recent like 10 years just very similar to you know
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:27.800]   660 and so in 1974 he filed a patent for Brown's gas and in 1976 he filed a
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.240]   second patent for it which he was awarded now what he did was he showed
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.560]   that hydrogen and oxygen could be separated from water which we know know
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:42.120]   that's possible but then burned cleanly and most importantly safely if we all
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.040]   remember the Hindenburg that's why people just don't burn pure H hydrogen
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:53.680]   gas hydrogen gas is extremely explosive and so you just do not want to you know
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.140]   try to use that as a fuel most welders you know they're using acetylene oxygen
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:01.840]   so forth right propane butane all these different things but you know and most
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:09.120]   people do not try to just burn hydrogen but he came up with an hydrogen oxygen
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:14.040]   combination that burned cleanly using many different objects and you know
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.120]   what's really really unique about this and here's just the abstract from his
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.160]   one of his 1974 patent and I'm just pulling this up because because I want
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.680]   you to understand where he was coming from and he never got into the whole
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:32.160]   health aspect of Brown's gas by the way he only focused on the welding aspect of
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.240]   Brown's gas which makes this so unique but you know when he put it all together
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.920]   and he submitted this for a patent basically he was talking about his
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:47.240]   patent was on a gas that utilizing mixture of hydrogen and oxygen generated in a
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.840]   substantially stoichiometric proportions in electrolytic cell by
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:56.040]   electrolytic disassociation of water more importantly it relates to atomic
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.000]   welding now when I first started getting into this I never heard the phrase
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.680]   atomic welding and what that means is that Brown's gas when lit when burning
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:11.680]   changes the the atomic structure whatever it's put on the flame is put on it's
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.880]   just unbelievable I mean it's it's like I was very surprised to learn about this
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.200]   because I didn't know it existed but you know if you're a welder you probably
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.600]   knew about this for 10-20 years already but with the welding guys they all know
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.960]   about this but the health guys are like just finding out kind of cool so now
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:31.600]   how is Brown's gas produced okay and that's what's really unique here unlike
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:40.560]   H2 gas that's produced Brown's gas is produced with an electrolyzer okay you've
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.560]   got the anode in the cathode you're passing electric current through water
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:50.440]   that's also includes an electrolyte the most common electrolyte used is sodium
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.480]   hydroxide which is also a lie which is the stuff that used to be in all our
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:00.080]   soap a hundred years ago or sooner I don't know but what happens is is that in
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:05.880]   between the anode in the cathode in the between the two electrical plates where
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:10.720]   you've got one side is pumping out oxygen one side's popping out hydrogen
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:17.840]   gas just pure hydrogen gas just pure oxygen O2 H2 in between the two anode
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:25.400]   and cathode is produced a third form of gas and this gas is when when is when
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:32.040]   is brought up and collected is a form of gas called and which is they gave it
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.920]   a name they called it Brown's gas they also called it oxyhydrogen or H H O
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.040]   okay you'll hear the H H O a lot if you look for YouTube videos you'll most
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.040]   likely find Brown's gas called H H O H H O generators for welding and so forth
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.800]   or there's very few health videos out right now I think this video that I'm
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.680]   making right now will be one of the first there are a whole bunch of other
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.800]   interviews George Weisman and so forth but this will be one of the first set
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.520]   actually covers it from a health perspective and and so this gas comes
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:09.760]   out and it's 66.6666 percent hydrogen and 33.333 percent oxygen so you've got
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:18.800]   the oxygen gas O2 and two hydrogen gas molecules H2 H2 and it forms a gas a
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.240]   different kind of gas combined together that is now called Brown's gas and what's
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.720]   really amazing about this about this gas and here are some of the properties
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:34.680]   that now of course remember now Brown's gas created wrote his file this patent
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:40.080]   in 74 so he'd been tinkering around with it for what 50 years right I mean this
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:43.640]   thing has been around for 50 years it's kind of like you know C 60 you know they
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.260]   came out in 86 and got the Nobel Prize in 96 so you know it's been around for a
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:53.280]   while really used in welding but now it's being looked at from a health
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.240]   perspective and the story behind that is amazing so but here's the properties
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.080]   behind ground bounce gas now what's theorized and this is where we're gonna
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.280]   go into theory now because this is all really kind of like okay everyone's
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:10.320]   trying to figure this out from a like what exactly is it is it's theorized
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.360]   that Brown's gas is a mixture of diatomic and monatomic hydrogen and oxygen
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:24.880]   which is meaning that it's monatomic but O1 H1 one atom of oxygen one atom of
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:32.000]   hydrogen and diatomic two atoms of oxygen to form an oxygen gas and two
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.640]   atoms of hydrogen to form hydrogen gas so you've got different elements of the
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.960]   same or different forms of the same elements within the gas you've got just
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:48.000]   an oxygen atom oxygen molecule hydrogen molecule hydrogen atom all mixed up
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.160]   together with water H2O vapor in the gas and something that's theorized and
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:00.320]   called electrically expanded water and I'll get into that in a second and so
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.400]   it's got these four separate components that forms this one gas and then one of
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.960]   the things that you know and it's been you know they've been dinking around and
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.280]   tinkering with this for years now okay and so they're fine this is what and
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.400]   there's actually in the links I highly anybody who's interested in this there
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.880]   is a demonstration link to actually you'll Brown doing demonstrations is really
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:27.640]   old video on YouTube like posted you know years ago but anybody's there and
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.080]   he's doing his demonstration he's talking about browns gas and he does all
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.840]   these different demonstrations and of course so they've been experimenting
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.080]   with this for a long time and so here's the here's some of the unique
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:43.840]   characteristics that that differentiates brown gas from just H2 gas that it has
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:51.680]   400 it puts out 442.4 kilocalories of available energy in the gas versus 115.7
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:58.960]   kilocalories from just regular old O2 okay so the combined gas has literally
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.680]   four times the amount of available energy you know when using as a fuel
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:09.360]   all right now and then one of the things is as a as a welding torch you when
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.840]   used as a welding fuel browns gas has zero emissions burned it's literally
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.800]   water in right you put water in a tank electrolyze it browns gas comes out you
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.640]   know if you set it up right and you burn that gas there are no fumes there's no
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:30.080]   exhaust the exhaust is it forms back in to water now it also alters like again
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:35.160]   atomic welding it alters the molecular structure of what's being welded if you
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:41.000]   watch that video it's it's it's it's it's amazing what what he does with this
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.560]   flame this brown glass you know browns gas flame and it changes temperature when
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.800]   applied to different materials and in the video he actually demonstrate that it
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.440]   can sublimated the sublimation is changing a substance from one state to
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:00.120]   another which is he takes tungsten which is one of the hardest metals in the
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:05.520]   planet and it takes 6,000 Fahrenheit degrees 6,000 it's like almost the heat of the
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.360]   Sun to get that to to sublimate to get that to melt right and he takes the
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:16.140]   browns gas flame and he and he just basically passes it over tungsten and it
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:22.440]   heats up and sublimates right and it but but that but that same flame he runs it
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.480]   passes arm and all it does is cinches hair and it doesn't even burn his skin
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.640]   and then he then he sits there and while the flame is on and this thing just
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:37.160]   melted tungsten so this this flame in the video melts the tungsten 6,000
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:42.000]   degrees Fahrenheit and he reaches over and he grabs the tip of the torch and he
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   just holds on to it with his fingers and it doesn't even burn him because they
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:53.880]   flame is it hot the flame is a completely different it's basically an
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:21:01.440]   implosive reaction of water it's literally water on fire and it has a
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.680]   completely different property then you would have had like let's say if you had
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.200]   a propane torch or an acetylene torch where there's no way you could touch the
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.960]   tip of the torch because the torch is hot because you're creating an explosive
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:21.200]   thermal reaction as opposed to a non explosive and implosive reaction it's
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.660]   just fascinating what he does in that video and then when now when you take
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.360]   browns gas and you bubble it in water and this is what's really interesting for
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:36.040]   those of you who drink H2 water the half-life of browns gas in water is 24
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:41.160]   hours versus only 20 minutes for H2 so for all these years I've been taking H2
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.480]   water and I can't tell you how many times I made a glass of water with some
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.840]   tablets and spaced out and forgot about it and it's been more than 20 minutes
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.840]   but within 20 minutes all the H2 gas just evaporates out of the water because H2
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.840]   is so small it goes in every direction and it's just gone and you have to start
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.920]   all over so you have to when you're making H2 water you got to drink it
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.280]   really quickly you got 20 minutes to get it in or it's gone you know and then
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.440]   you have to start over but with browns gas water it's you could make a batch of
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.360]   water in the morning drink it all day and you've got your browns gas water for
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:19.040]   the whole day so it's very different than H2 so the other properties we'll get
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.920]   into in a second here but what I want to do okay so I have a quote from George
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:28.520]   Weisman so now you'll brown passed away in 1998 and in and before he passed away
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.520]   another gentleman who is a tinker an inventor came along his name's George
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.440]   Weisman and his company's called Eagle Research and he started producing
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:43.440]   browns gas or H2 welding generators in the US market and he started experimenting
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.520]   with it and he's a tinker and so he started tinkering around with it and so
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.560]   this is one of his theories from one of his books which is he states and this
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:56.480]   is where I get into the electrically expanded water aspect is he believes
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:01.040]   that matter has four phases solid liquid and gas right and then there's this
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:07.880]   plasma phase and so like electrically expanded water exw is water this is
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:13.320]   George Weisman's quote is water that has soaked up extra electrons to become a
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:18.720]   negatively charged plasma phase of water electrically expanded water is not the
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:23.080]   same as the misnamed easy water of George Pollock which is quote the fourth
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.080]   phase of water right if you read that book easy water is not even water it's H3O2
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:33.000]   and exists in a gel like state and that's that's George's quoting so what George
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   is saying and if you read the whole you know section of that book is he's
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.840]   theorizing for those of you guys who are really into structured water and and
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.600]   messing around with water because water is a very unique thing this isn't the
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:50.200]   fourth phase of water per George he's thinking that this is literally a new
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.680]   thing that has not been discovered before and he's calling it the fifth
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.640]   stage of water or electrically expanded water and what's interesting and I want
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:05.600]   to point out was he recently spoke George recently spoke at the 2019 water
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.880]   conference on the physics chemistry and biology of water in October that was
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.600]   hosted in Germany where Gerald Pollock was speaking and numerous just you know
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.560]   very well-renowned scientists were giving speeches about about water and
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.760]   all the different aspects of water and George was presenting there as well and
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.960]   during the Q&A session right at the end the gentleman who had just produced
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:32.300]   who just had done a presentation on easy water popped up and and and and
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.400]   spoke spoke to George and theorized and said you know maybe this is not
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.920]   necessarily you know electrically expanded water but maybe this is also
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.760]   maybe this could be easy water with extra protons and so now there's some
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.160]   debate and there a lot more research needs to be done again this is all
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.760]   theoretical but why I bring that up and this is why it's really important this
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:59.080]   is why this is electro healing this is why this may be better than C60 is because
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:04.440]   if it's if George is correct and it's got a lot of extra extra electrons that it
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.680]   picks up and it's that fifth stage of water and that's what the gas creates is
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.120]   this water or even if it's easy water which stands for exclusion zone or fourth
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:17.880]   phase of water structured water with extra protons what that means and this
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:23.080]   is why it's so amazing as a health thing is what that means is it's charging our
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:28.040]   body and it's charging ourselves when you take it in okay and then so I want to
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.400]   point out something here that that a lot of folks don't forget because from you
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.360]   know remember your chemistry days in high school I don't you know but the idea
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.760]   of pH okay pH stands for potential hydrogen so here we go we go back to
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.600]   hydrogen again and the thing about pH and we don't know this right I mean most
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.480]   people remember that but hey you know that our bodies run on an optimal level
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:54.560]   of pH around 7.35 okay and but the here the here the thing is is what is pH how
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.280]   do you measure pH well if you've ever had a pH meter it's got what two prongs
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.080]   it's got an anode and a cathode you stick it in water and you measure the
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.080]   current between the two and whatever that current is or you know it then tells
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.440]   you what the pH so there's a corresponding you know basically translation
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.920]   between pH is the same thing as voltage because it's measuring the
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.280]   voltage across the anode and a cathode in in a pH meter that's what pH is it's
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.800]   measuring voltage in the body so the corresponding voltage of the body and
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.880]   this you know there's tons of science literature on body voltage is about 20
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:34.240]   millivolts okay negative 20 millivolts and so your optimum you as a as a human
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:41.520]   being your body has an optimum pH level that it runs that's what is designed to
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:48.000]   run on at 7.35 pH right at and also and which also means at a negative 20
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.240]   millivolts and so that's your optimum range so anything above that you know
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.960]   that the number goes higher as you start taking in antioxidants and
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.600]   anti-annual alkaline foods and things for the numbers go higher it means it's
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.040]   more alkaline or if the numbers go lower it means it's more acidic and that's
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:10.760]   also translates in the same concept of alkaline and acidic high pH low pH high
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:16.920]   voltage low voltage is the same concept of electron donor the more alkaline
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:23.000]   something is or the higher the pH is or the higher the negative voltage is the
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.200]   it's an electron donor your donut your get your gaining electrons right which
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:32.920]   is then puts you into a healing mode up to a certain point but any anything
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:39.080]   past the threshold of negative 70 millivolts or 8.23 alkalinity if it's
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.400]   anything more than that then it starts getting into unhealthy because your
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:47.120]   optimum is down here remember so up here is bad but this little range in here
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:52.920]   right here is normal healing and so I'm theorizing that what makes this so
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.880]   incredible what makes brown gas so incredible for our health is the fact
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.840]   that it's got those electrons as electrically expanded water or if it
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:06.720]   is easy water it's got those extra protons and let me show you what that
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.800]   means but now if you take in acidic stuff it's an electron stealers so acidic
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.560]   stuff is I mean literally like a soda touching chemicals food preservatives
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:20.400]   the crap in the air emf I mean literally emf cell phone all that stuff is
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:25.160]   electron Steelers and it causes your body to become more acidic and it causes
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.480]   your voltage to go up to a positive and if that happens you start getting sick
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.120]   and when you when you live at this level down here or you live at this level up
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.640]   here then what not only are you ill and your cells become damaged you end up
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:47.560]   with chronic diseases so it's all health optimum health is all about pH and
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:53.120]   voltage and how you can help yourself stay in a natural form of healing is by
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.640]   making sure that you're getting rid of those radical oxygen species or that
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:03.920]   oxidative stress right by ingesting or exposing or exercising or eating the
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:08.120]   right foods that are alkaline in nature so that you've got electron donation to
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:15.040]   keep you in this range of of voltage in this range of pH to stay healthy or if
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:20.160]   you don't you become unhealthy and again too much is not good so like I'm for
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.720]   one I'm not for drinking alkaline water I don't think it's good to drink alkaline
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.480]   water I think you should get you should raise your voltage and get your don't
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.120]   your donated electrons from a different source because your your stomachs got
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.360]   acid in it and you don't want to mess with the natural balance of your of
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:39.000]   your stomach that's my personal opinion okay don't beat me up over it but that's
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.640]   my opinion about alkaline water I think hydrogen water is awesome but I think
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.400]   browns gas water is even more awesome because we do you hear what it does so
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:51.040]   one more time about this concept now when you actually look at how our cells
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:57.280]   every cell in our body has what they call a cytoskeleton which kind of keeps
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.720]   it rigid so it doesn't get squashed okay and around that is our cell membrane and
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.960]   what's really I think just so fascinating about this because when you talk about
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:12.280]   browns gas you're talking about structured water okay now our bodies are
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:17.240]   made up of structured water in a gel like state so that's easy water right and so
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:22.000]   on the outside of all of our cells is this membrane of water of structured
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.400]   water in a gel like state that's high in electrons and then what happens is is
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.800]   when we are exposed to light okay when we're exposed to light or are we ingest
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:37.000]   things that have you know are like basically nutrients then our bodies our
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.880]   cells will extract protons from that they'll extract protons and electrons the
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.040]   electrons stay within these structured water and the protons then get sucked
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.720]   into the inside of the cell through these cavities through the cytoskeleton to
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:56.600]   come into the cell then which then does a couple of things as those protons come
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:02.080]   into the cell which normally runs at 7.5 so the cell itself runs at neutral pH
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:06.880]   for your body but we have these things in our cells called lysomes what these
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.240]   lysomes do is they run at an acidic low pH right they run their various
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.120]   acidic to do their jobs because what do they have to do from an acidic nature
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:20.800]   well what lysomes do in our inside of our cells is to eat up all the mitochondria
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:26.320]   and cook and waste of that yourself because your cell produces waste and it
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.160]   just dissolves and eats it all up and gets rid of it and so you need your
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:35.440]   lysomes to be able to attract and bring in protons in order for it to do its
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.040]   job for your cell to run at an optimum level and at the same time through your
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:44.440]   cytoskeleton these protons come in through the cavities and also feed your
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.880]   mitochondria and now if you know what your mitochondria does is it's your
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:52.320]   energy it's your generator every little cell has a little generator in it called
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.520]   a mitochondria and when it pulls in these protons it creates energy and
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:01.240]   otherwise called ATP production and that's what gives you energy that's what
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.680]   makes you walk around and so it's through this process of ATP generation and
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.120]   lysomes doing the you know at waste production or waste elimination your
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:14.360]   mitochondria producing energy this cell is a very happy little cell but here's
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:20.680]   the thing what happens when you have positive charge on the inside negative
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.040]   charge in the outside okay you have a little battery and this little battery
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:32.200]   is again essentially your bio-electromagnetic life force of this cell and so
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:37.360]   your body requires electrons your body requires protons to operate at an
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.320]   optimum level and of course if you're ill chronic diseases whatever it doesn't
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.600]   so what happens if something comes along and pumps you full of protons and
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.040]   electrons and you've been feeling down you're stressed out you have a lot of
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:52.840]   you know oxidative stress in your body you have illnesses damage injuries
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.400]   whatever when all of those electrons come in from the brown gas or the
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:02.760]   protons that come in from the easy water or both when it comes into your body it
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:09.160]   does amazing things so now if you want to know a lot more about what it does you
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.240]   need to listen to George Wiseman talk about what his customers have been
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.040]   telling him now what George Wiseman himself has has actually published because
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:23.320]   George Wiseman is the inventor of several different gizmos mainly the you
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:27.120]   know the A.A. the H.H.O. or the brownscast generating a welder welding
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.600]   equipment but he's got an incredible story and his incredible story starts
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:36.200]   around 2005-2006 when one of his customers one day told him that he took
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:41.040]   the gas from his welder that George sold him and he said yeah you know he
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:47.040]   put it in you know he made bubbled it in water and he had a melanoma on his forehead
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.720]   and according to George what the customer did was he took a cotton ball
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:56.320]   and he dipped it in the H.H.O. water and he taped it to his melanoma and like
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:01.720]   within a week or so it was gone it just dried up fell off or and and it healed
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:06.440]   over over course of a few weeks but boom it was gone and the story goes on
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:10.920]   and on about more and more customers reporting to George that oh you know I
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:15.160]   was I had my welder and I decided to you know bubble it in water and drink
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.400]   the water or I had my welder and I decided to breathe the fuel I mean who
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.040]   does that but they did and so more and more of his customers started doing that
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.360]   and reporting these incredible health benefits and what George basically did
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.240]   was he didn't believe it I mean who would but after 10 years he decided I
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:35.840]   think it's like in the early 2011-2011 early teens right in the years
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:40.720]   2000s he decided to try it himself and so then he started trying it and I
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:48.320]   believe that he probably kicked in around 2014-2015 till now so here's a guy
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.000]   who all of a sudden decided you know what my customers all keep telling me
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.760]   that it's really good for me or good for you as a human so maybe I should try it
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:00.800]   and so he started trying it himself and the results were amazing so then he
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:05.240]   eventually developed a brown gas generator for health and then a couple
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.920]   of other folks have done so as well because it is in its infancy the brown
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:15.320]   gas health craze has not started yet it's in its infancy and it's all kind of
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.960]   started with George and so this is what he said and in his in his
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:25.960]   writings about what happened to him since 2014-2015 this is for George and
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:30.760]   it's amazing and he says my site is improved he's worn glasses since he was
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.600]   nine years old and he doesn't wear glasses anymore except driving his hair
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.840]   continues to darken and now if you look at George's old videos you can tell he's
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.600]   looking a little older than he looks now it's pretty amazing it's subtle it's
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.280]   very subtle but it's it's it's there and you could see you could tell the
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:50.920]   difference his skin has changed and so he's saying that you know is he feels
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:55.240]   that his hair is growing back that he used to be bolder and then a psoriasis is
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.480]   gone that he used to have thick you know thick peeling skin on his elbows and
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:03.800]   knees and feet gone breathing and drinking brown gas water his skin smoothed
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.520]   out became supple age wrinkles gradually disappearing his scars that he had since
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:15.000]   childhood started disappearing his age spots disappearing his neuropathy's are
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.040]   gone he can feel perfectly in his feet and hands and his shins again he had
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.840]   just a tightness sorry and it's that he had that it's still there but barely
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.600]   noticeable he also went on to say that his warts are gone that he had handworts
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:34.360]   and planters warts which are caused by viruses gone his arthritis gone and it
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:39.720]   hadn't been six since 2005 oh I'm sorry I guess he started 2005 I got it wrong
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.560]   and he lost weight and he used to have a heart murmur and his doctor reports he
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.400]   no longer has the heart murmur now in the conference in october he also mentioned
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.240]   in his in his presentation that they started now experimenting within the
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:55.880]   last few years on farm animals and so they gave it to some chickens and the
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.720]   the for like the first week the egg production of the chickens literally
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.360]   doubled for one week it went back to normal after that
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:06.920]   but it did something and and it definitely doubled the amount of eggs that
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.840]   the chickens put out and so they're definitely an area for more research
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.440]   and he also talked about increasing plank growth um in that's in in his
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:19.000]   presentation he talked about when you bubble browns gas and water
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.880]   and you feed it to plants in soil that the growth rate increases by 30 percent
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:29.320]   but if you do it in hydroponics the growth rate you know explodes up
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:34.440]   60 percent more growth if you put browns gas in water in a hydroponic system
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.920]   so what does all of this mean and and so it's like it's like the early days of
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.280]   c60 and if you remember what happened in c60
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:47.960]   the carbon 60 molecule it was discovered in 86 they won the nobel prize
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:51.960]   the first application of c60 is a commercial lubricant
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:55.480]   that's what they use it for they use it to lubricate ball bearings and stuff
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.120]   and there was then there was some interest in it and from because it was
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.560]   really good for oxygen you know radical oxygen
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:05.400]   species it would it was antioxidant they started using it in the cosmetic
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.440]   industry about 10 years later in the early 2000s
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.520]   but they only thought of it as a commercial industry thing and they
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.960]   didn't really think about people like actually eating it and ingesting it in
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.840]   oil and that's kind of the exact same story here
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.400]   it's like you know these guys use it for welding
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.360]   for 30 years all they did for it with it was welding
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.280]   and now within the last let's say 10 years send 15 years
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:32.760]   people are taking it for their health and this is just one guy's story
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.040]   about what it has done for him and it's amazing
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.160]   right and then if you listen to him talk you'll hear about other customers
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.360]   and he's also now trying to get studies going
[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.360]   with people who took browns gas and one of the biggest challenges
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.320]   is that he said he went back to look at all of the material
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.360]   on all the studies that of the hydrogen studies
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.080]   and discovered that some of those hydrogen studies
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.800]   when you look at the materials and methods of the study
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.320]   that they were actually doing browns gas and not actually h2 gas but they
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.280]   weren't they don't say it that way they just go we tried hydrogen
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.240]   so he's trying to go through all of those studies to kind of pull out
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:12.360]   like which studies actually did a 66 h2 and 3302
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:16.360]   you know study versus h2 study you know and so he's trying to do all of that
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.000]   right now and this is all just happening right now
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.520]   today this month this year fascinating stuff so
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.480]   now as I mentioned earlier in the video
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:30.440]   I have been doing this myself so I ran across all of this stuff because I
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.920]   had been taking h2 tablets for a while now
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.640]   and I really wanted to try h2 inhalation
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.480]   so I went shopping for an h2 inhalation machine and I ran across
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:43.080]   and this is how I even started with this whole project
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.200]   I ran across brown gas generators and so you know I'm me
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:50.280]   I'm I'm me so I'm like what's brown gas generators
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.960]   and that's how this all started and I I was like fascinated
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:57.640]   so I bought myself a browns gas generator one month ago
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:01.080]   and I have been using it ever since so here is my
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.680]   this is my personal testimony my opinion
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.040]   I've been using it for four weeks now and so
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:12.120]   my intake for the first three solid weeks
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:16.760]   was I drank a half to one gallon of browns gas water a day I'd bubble it in
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:20.600]   the morning drink the whole thing and then half a gallon and then I'd come home
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.720]   bubble another half a gallon and try to bang away on that thing
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:26.840]   through the night and then I would sit down at the end of my night
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.800]   and for at least two hours while I was on the computer or on the couch
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.560]   I would breathe yeah I'm actually I've actually got the cannula
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.200]   and my nose right now I'm breathing brown gas as I saw
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.640]   and I would just breathe brown gas for a couple hours every night
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.120]   and I did that for three solid weeks until the holidays
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:45.160]   started and then things got messed up but so
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:49.160]   in week two my eyesight began to change and I didn't really think you know I'm
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.720]   busy I'm just doing this thing it's like I'm doing
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.440]   lots of different experiments all the time and disclaimer by the way you all
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:59.400]   know I take a bunch of supplements and I have and I'm consistently taking C60
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.640]   way before I started this and to this day I'm taking the regular one tablespoon
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.480]   dose of C60 every day so but on top of that I'm doing brown gas
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.160]   so in week two and if you guys have been wearing glasses for a long time you
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:16.520]   can relate to this but you know I'm an older person but not
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:23.240]   geyser no offense to all you geysers and so I've been basically I've been
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.440]   nearsighted most of my life so for over like 30 40 years
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.520]   I've been wearing glasses because I'm nearsighted so whenever I'm
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.160]   walking around outside in my car I'm wearing glasses in my house I'm wearing
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.520]   glasses you know so I could see like you know watch TV
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:42.200]   and drive and stuff and so I've been I've been nearsighted almost my whole life
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:45.880]   and then for the last I'd say 10 15 years you know my eyesight because I
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.720]   work on a computer most of the time my eyesight started to go
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:53.880]   really bad in terms of being able to see my computer clearly and no matter how
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.880]   big a screen I get you know and so I had I was prescribed
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.400]   computer glasses they wish they used to call reading glasses in the old days
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:06.040]   but I was prescribed computer glasses they first they wanted me to have bifocals
[00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:10.520]   no those are horrible so I have I wear two sets of glasses one when I'm
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.120]   sitting at a desk and I take that off and I put my other ones on and I'm
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.240]   always wearing glasses you look at any picture of me
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:21.480]   going back 30 40 years I got glasses on so this is what was weird and but you
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:25.160]   know and every few years right your eyesight changes and you're like oh
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:30.040]   crap you know I'm getting older I gotta go back to doctor so-and-so and go
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:34.360]   get another exam and and then update my prescription so
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.480]   this is what happened and I didn't even I didn't put the two to two together but
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.640]   what happened a couple weeks ago was my eyesight started to change you know
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.840]   and I just was like bumming out because now like I gotta go get more
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.120]   different set of glasses and I just couldn't see very well and I was just
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:52.680]   kind of like it was irritating me and then so one day I was sitting at my desk
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:55.880]   and I just took my glasses off to rub my eyes
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.200]   I looked up and my computer was clear as day
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:05.160]   and I was like and it was just I was shocked I honestly I'm just telling you
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.720]   just honestly I was shocked because it just it like a light bulb went off in
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:13.160]   my head that it wasn't my eyes getting worse that my eyes
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:17.640]   were getting better because when I could see without my glasses and I was I was
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.600]   so shocked by that I just I can't even explain
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.240]   just the concept of like holy crap I can see without glasses what you know
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:28.040]   it's like oh miracle you know I mean it was just weird it was just the
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:31.320]   weirdest thing and I was like wow and then I realized you know that's probably
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:35.640]   going on because you know same thing with my other glasses and sure enough
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:40.200]   week two my eyesight started to improve by week three I'd stop wearing glasses I
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:45.560]   couldn't see well with my glasses after all these years I couldn't see well
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:49.960]   with my glasses and so that kept up where I did not wear
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:56.680]   any glasses until like earlier this week and this is today is Saturday
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.760]   on November 30th Thanksgiving was a couple of days ago
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:04.600]   my daughter's home from college and you know people in the house
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.120]   the holidays everything's very disruptive I'm off work
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:13.160]   so my whole routine got thrown off plus my machine
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.840]   I needed to do some maintenance on my machine and I didn't have time
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:20.680]   so my machine I had to I didn't do it for three days so this is what happened
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.680]   was I did it every single day for literally three weeks and in the fourth
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.520]   week I had to stop and I couldn't do it as much I couldn't drink as much of the
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:32.280]   water I couldn't inhale as much as the gas
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:36.360]   and then literally for three days I didn't do anything until I could get to my
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:42.360]   machine and do the maintenance on it so I did not wear any glasses for the
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.280]   entire third week I'm in week four now I still
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:51.160]   do not need any computer glasses at all I'm not wearing glasses right now
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:55.160]   but what happens was I started to go back to normal
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:59.480]   normal meaning I need my glasses to drive around at night
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:03.640]   and so I realized that you know this is only the first four weeks and there's
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:07.320]   a lot more experimenting to do but for me personally
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:13.960]   this thing has changed my eyesight this thing browns gas also implies to me
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.400]   that it needs to be something that you take every day
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:21.000]   and that and that and that it does accumulate over time because I'm
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.360]   thinking if I did this for six months could I probably skip
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:28.200]   a week probably but doing this just for three weeks and then skipping three or
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.240]   four days you know your eyes revert kind of back to what
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.320]   you want that's kind of what I'm thinking right now
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.120]   so I'm just I'm just thinking a lot I just wanted to share what I'm thinking
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.400]   but that's kind of where I'm at right now which is like my eyesight change
[00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:43.000]   guys my I can't I can't even express how
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.240]   incredibly astounding that is to me to not have to wear glasses
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:52.200]   after all these years and it's true I mean what George was saying
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:59.160]   it happened to me so I'm very ecstatic about keeping up this experiment to
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.600]   continue to breathe browns gas to continue to drink the water
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:06.760]   and I want to do it for a long time I want to see what happens if what
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.600]   happens to George happens to me so I'm just reporting where I'm at
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:14.600]   this is the four-week mark and I just wanted to share it with you because
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.480]   it's just an amazing to me it's just amazing okay
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:21.560]   and and so now I just want to get back into the rest of the presentation
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.560]   how I you know how how you take it for those of you interested in pursuing
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:30.200]   something like this this is what I did was I went and bought the aqua cure
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.280]   which is the browns gas generator that George Wiseman
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:39.320]   sells now there's equally good and I went I went shopping for a long time
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.600]   before I pick one these aren't cheap but they range anywhere from fourteen
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.400]   hundred all the way up to twenty five hundred okay
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.600]   and and the reason that they range in price is because they have
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:52.680]   like this one has more features but the safety features of these are pretty
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:57.720]   much equal I actually if anyone's interested I can do a comparison video
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.240]   because I actually bought this guy and the reason I bought this guy too
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:04.520]   now I've been using the aqua cure for the whole month right but like I said it
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.880]   went down for maintenance and when it went down for maintenance and it
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.960]   takes a couple hours to mess around with it to you know to maintain it and you
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:15.960]   have to do this maintenance thing I was down for three days and after
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.320]   this experience of of of getting my eyesight back
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:23.400]   and then all of a sudden it's starting to revert back because I wasn't you know
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.600]   I was like I'm so I kind of like was like okay wait I'm gonna buy a little
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:30.280]   tiny backup just things like half the size but I want to buy a backup so that
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.760]   the next time this happens to me in the middle of a work week
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.680]   I can just switch right over to my backup and I don't lose momentum
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.080]   and then I can just maintain this thing on the weekends because I just don't have
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.360]   time okay so that's why I bought a backup but now that I have two
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.400]   I can do a comparison video if anyone's interested let me know in the comments
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:50.120]   but so these are all highly reputable companies you've got hydrogen for
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:54.440]   health and you've got alkyl way I've had lots of different alkyl way
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:57.240]   there are water filters over time the last 20 years
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.440]   good filters so I'm sure the quality is just as good with this
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.080]   so these are three different brownscast
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.720]   generators that are on the market right now that I would say
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.560]   are probably a goodbye based on the people that you're gonna get really good
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:13.880]   customer service and believe me customer service
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:18.760]   is essential you will have questions these things are not plug and play
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.520]   devices these things require setup these things require
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:27.320]   maintenance and you will have questions so do not buy one of these off of ebay
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:30.600]   from some chinese faceless company that good luck
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.920]   you're gonna get this thing you're not gonna know what to do the instructions
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:35.720]   will be in crappy english and you'll be screwed
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.200]   so I'm just saying if you're going to get into this do it
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.880]   or you can just like I can email george he'll respond on a weekend I mean I
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:45.160]   emailed the guy one time he's responded me on a sunday I mean george is
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.560]   awesome there's this guy over here runs this thing called steve
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.840]   his name is steve awesome service I mean literally I ordered it and I was in
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.800]   my house in three days so so these two awesome I haven't
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.120]   tried alkyl way I don't really want to buy a third one honestly I don't want to
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:58.120]   buy a third one but I've got these two so this is
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:01.480]   what you can do and if you are interested in a comparison video I can
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.480]   talk about the features setup and all that stuff
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:08.120]   between the two just let me know so that's that and so
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:11.880]   if now if you want more information about browns gas uh george wiseman has
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:15.640]   written two books on the subject and even better book one tells you how to
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.440]   build your own okay so this is why I find this guy really
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.640]   amazing he's not in it for wealth and fame you
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:25.320]   know he's not holding it to himself he literally has the instructions here go
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.720]   build your own and if you don't want to build your own i'll build you one and
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.600]   you can buy mine right but the whole idea is that it's not
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.080]   proprietary it's not a secret he's not holding it to his chest
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.200]   he wants the world to have browns gas generators
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.880]   build it yourself or buy one from him buy one from steve buy one from anybody
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:43.000]   if you want to try doing this for your own health it's up to you
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.080]   um but uh but you can buy the books here on his website so he's got books on it
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:50.600]   as well and that's it this is my story about browns gas
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:54.120]   it's part of my electro healing healing series because
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:58.200]   uh you need electricity to create it and it is
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:03.400]   it is electricity it is electrons and it is incredibly
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:07.800]   healing it healed my eyesight i am astounded
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.160]   i cannot wait for what it does to me next and

[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:27.960]   that i do have a bioelectrical magnetics telegram chat group
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:31.400]   uh link in the description below if you want to join in on the conversation
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:36.040]   about bioelectrical magnetics whether it's about browns gas whether it's about
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:40.680]   bob bex zappers or multi-wave oscillators or rife technology
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.720]   or even quantum stuff which we have a separate chat group for that
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:47.000]   um you know just feel free join our chat group ask
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.960]   questions i'm always really easily in there
