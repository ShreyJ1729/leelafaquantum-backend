[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   Hello everyone and welcome to another interview with Phillip Von Holton door of Leila Quantum Tech.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.680]   This is part two of our original interview. We did a week ago and you know for those of you
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.200]   the link will be in the description below for that part one. This is part two.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.760]   We're going to pick up where we left off and for those of you that are brand new and this is the
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.720]   first video you've seen on Leila Quantum Tech. I do want to introduce Phillip. He is the owner and
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.560]   proprietor of Leila Labs which is a C60 company producing C60 oil and C60 topical products
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.000]   and then he's also now ventured off into this other adventure called Leila Quantum Tech and
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.960]   sees the owner proprietor of that and so we've had an interview before talking about the general
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.480]   basis of the foundation of the energy and the products and now we're going to be today we're
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.200]   going to pick up where we left off which is talking about actual test that actual testing that was
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.840]   done. We went over the certificates in the version of you and now we're going to actually get into
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.960]   the actual how they did the testing and all of this material will eventually be available on
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.600]   the website. I got an early copy that being translated from German to English and you know
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.160]   it's quite amazing because I did a little bit of a deep dive last night into all of this material.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.360]   There were 16 separate studies and it is amazing not only does it validate
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.840]   the actual products in terms of like EMF protection you know like it protects
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.720]   of the body but even more so it promotes wellness and that's what these studies picked up but we'll
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.520]   get into that in a second. So, welcome Phillip. Good morning. It's really early hearing boy.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.880]   How are you doing today? Hey good to talk to you. Thanks for having me.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.880]   Okay so let's talk about the test results and so this is where it gets really amazing.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.400]   Now for me I'm just sort of a nerd but if you click on the research and studies
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.320]   section basically as I understand it right you had 16 different studies ran
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:12.720]   on your two primary products which was your t-shirt which is a shielded fabric so that's
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.360]   kind of like like I was mentioning earlier a brute force shielding fabric which got silver
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.960]   embedded in the fabric silver threads so that would be something that if you were to go to any
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.400]   regular EMF protective type of of sight they would sell clothing materials things like that
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.280]   but then you've charged it with your with your quantum energy and then you've had it tested
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.360]   and so you had test runs on those you had tests done on the the heel capsule itself you know the
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.320]   brass capsule right is there anything else I have only been able to get through about maybe
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.720]   a half of it but but what's new on the website now is is is a write-up of the results from the
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.120]   from the shirt right up of the results from the heel capsule and then of course this right up here
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.240]   on from a second there's two different groups right there's one group called BESA and this other
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.480]   called IEGF so exactly I'm gonna so correct me if I'm wrong but I'm just gonna do a quick little
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.760]   thing here where I want to explain to everybody how they tested because that's something that you
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.320]   know if you've ever seen my other videos I'm really into the whole studies and methods and
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.320]   materials sections of each study whether that's where the you know the rubber hits the road it's
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.120]   like okay well what what did they study and what machine you know what it devices what devices did
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.760]   they use to study and what did they study so I want to just point out to the audience that
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.600]   each one of these studies they they basically took a you know it was just people who did not know
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.000]   what was going on they were just brought in and you know put on a shirt or wear this pen right
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.120]   but they did have no idea what the product was and they basically measured these people
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.800]   they measured them three ways the first way was that just walking in the door sit down let me
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.000]   measure you the second one was all right let me let me subject you to whatever I'm gonna test
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.080]   like whether it's EMF or radiation or you know toxic substances and there's also one that was on
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.600]   where they disorders and pathogens and so there's four different types of exposures that people
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   were exposed to but not in a dangerous way and then so then they would expose them and then
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.960]   they would give them the product and then expose them again and so that's that's correct right Phil
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.080]   yes absolutely okay and then the two different devices so BESA uses a different protocol than
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.000]   IGEF now BESA and this was the thing that was interesting for me and I got a little story you're
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.440]   gonna love BESA uses a bio energetic base test and what bio energetic testing is is it was
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.440]   invented by a doctor Voll who is a physicist and what's really interesting Philip when I was reading
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.960]   this last night and I was really quite surprised that they were using the Voll because I want to
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.280]   just kind of just share with people that are watching this that you know what is bio energetic
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.080]   testing and I want to make sure that people understand that it is it is not woo woo you know
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.920]   hippie stuff I mean this is an actual two physicists a doctor Voll and a doctor Warner and German
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.200]   physicists developed this new approach and what it is it they created a computer based instrument
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.320]   which measures the energy of the body using acupuncture meridian point readings okay so if
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.120]   you understand anything about you know Chinese physiology you know the methodology and their
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.600]   and their belief systems you know they believe is that the whole body is basically an electrical
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.560]   system or of an energy system actually and the energy runs along meridians within the body and
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.520]   there's points along those radians that are very crucial and and that's what the whole acupuncture
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.160]   thing is and and how Chinese doctors help people is wherever they see flows blockages of the energy
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.440]   they'll put a an acupuncture needle in the meridian for that blockage and then it does allows the
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.480]   energy to flow which then promotes healing so that's the concept of acupuncture and radians
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.320]   and acupuncture points and so what these two German physicists did was they studied that Chinese
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:15.200]   medical theory and they applied modern day physics to it from like a physiology standpoint developed
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:22.000]   a device that could then read the electrical signals coming off of it basically the electrical
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.760]   resistance of the acupuncture points and that's what their device does so this is quite real
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:34.400]   and because I've actually run into other types of products that claim that they've been certified
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.120]   and then when I go into those certifications and I look at the methods and materials and I look
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.240]   at the devices used and then I look at you know that I actually look at the device and what people
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.360]   say about the device you know a lot of times these you know like these fake cell phone sticker
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.840]   things you'll find out that it's just completely bogus when you drill down into the methods and
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.960]   materials so you know Philip love you guys but I went and did that and then when I drilled into
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:06.160]   this one I was really amazed they're using a what they call a EVA machine it's a deck of
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.920]   volt electro acupuncture diagnostics and that's what that is and so you know you actually can go out
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:17.760]   and get your own and they run anywhere from 245 to 6 and this is what that machine looks like and
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:24.720]   I want to say something about this is why I'm so surprised is because I have a personal
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:33.360]   story about how well a volt deca device works and this is that story and I want to share it with
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.560]   everybody so that you know that where I'm coming from and my belief system here as to the certification
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.960]   results that Philip's going to share is my daughter is a college student she's working towards a
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.720]   veterinarian degree she's currently an agricultural school at University of Hawaii Helo and as part
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.080]   of her you know senior year she's a research associate on a major problem we have here in Hawaii
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:02.880]   called rat lung worm disease and so right now it's it's basically a big problem in in the in
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:10.960]   the agriculture business in industry and where cattle sheep even pets are contracting rat lung
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.560]   disease and so there's this huge study that's funded by NIH that's going on right now at the
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.400]   University of Hawaii and my daughter is one of the research associates so last a few months ago
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:28.080]   a lady walked in that they were which was friends of a professor and she had a volt deca machine
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:32.160]   with her my daughter didn't know what the machine was nobody knew what that thing was which this
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.560]   lady walks in and they're talking about rat lung worm and so the lady goes let me test you
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.520]   or let me test and see and so what she did was they had five research associates there in the lab
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:48.560]   and and and each one of the research associate they did tests before and after holding a vial
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:57.680]   of the rat lung rat lung worm virus okay and so they they did the tests using the volt deca machine
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:04.320]   on the associates the lady measured the associates and they did these five people on and off for like
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:12.240]   an hour and 100% of the time when they were holding the vial of the rat lung worm that she could tell
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.440]   that they that they had that they had the they had the pathogen on them and when they weren't holding
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:23.520]   it she could tell that they weren't holding it your body picks up the frequency of whatever
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:29.520]   you're next to or touching and so that's really was was there everybody in the lab was just really
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:36.240]   amazed at what this lady's device could she was like a holistic wellness coach and they were just
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.280]   everyone was really shocked that she had this little device because what their entire research
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.840]   project is on this rat lung worm and why they're studying it so much is they're trying to develop
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:51.440]   a test they need a quick and fast test that the veterinarian can go out into a field or to a barn
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.080]   or farm and test all the animals really quickly and see which ones have it and that's what they're
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.920]   trying to develop right now at University of Hawaii is they're trying to develop that rapid test
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.560]   for rat lung worm and here's this lady walks in with this little device and shows them within an
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.760]   hour that here you know this device works here's the problem you know it's a it's it was it wasn't
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.280]   like the university didn't feel comfortable that this was such you like it was an accepted way of
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.920]   testing and so they don't want to use the machine even though she proved it to them which is crazy
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.080]   but that's the true story and this happened within the last few months so Philip when I saw this I
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:29.280]   was just amazed because I know for a fact because of my daughter telling me that this device you know
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.920]   what it did and she was just telling me the story of it I asked her to call that lady and
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.000]   find out what that device was and that's how I know she used the vault she contacted her
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.120]   and said yeah she used this thing and she gave me the name of it and I did the research and
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:50.240]   that's why I know about this device so it's it's it's an amazing thing that that you know when you
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:57.200]   went and did your testing that your testing uh on for Bessa was using a bold eka you know the
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:04.320]   bold eka in my personal opinion is an authentic accurate device that can measure the differences
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.920]   between uh having pathogens on you not having pathogens on you or being you know being exposed
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.840]   to stimuli anyway that's I just wanted to share that Philip because I thought it was amazing
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.840]   yeah that's fantastic actually that that you're sharing this and that you've had this personal
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.840]   experience also with it because certainly you know that's that's not not everybody knows about
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:32.720]   this right and and indeed so Bessa stands for bio energetic system analysis and it's actually
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:40.800]   one of the leading if not the leading bio energetic system analysis institutes in Europe
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:51.280]   that focuses on testing and they use and basically that machine in a in an advanced way
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:12:01.840]   and it's it's very very very very interesting you know and we were we were we were also amazed by
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:09.040]   by the results and everything because we knew what the products would do and you know
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:15.760]   then we have our healers that can see energetically what what happens with people if they were the
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:22.720]   t-shirt or or hoodie or the the lead on quantum capsule and so on but it's then different if you
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:29.520]   you know send of your products to such an institute and then they just have random people
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:37.360]   where those and they test those and it's yeah it's it's it's it's fantastic that it's possible
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.080]   that you can test these things and it's it's also fantastic how the results came back and
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:49.520]   yeah you've explained everything pretty much about how this works which is fantastic no I
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:56.480]   don't have to do it do a great job that you could not be done in a better way and also this
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:02.800]   summary there that you showed I think it's it's helpful for people to understand and maybe we can
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.240]   go into yeah I wanted to do that was actually tested right yeah let's take a look at what was
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:14.000]   tested so there's a bunch of different ones so you know there's so much detail here like I said
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.320]   352 pages 16 studies I you know there's no way we can get through all of it but I do want to point
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:27.120]   out like here's here's this is a really crappy translation by the way I'm just using Google
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:33.440]   PDF translate and so it doesn't come out as nice as the one that's on the website but
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:39.200]   Philip if you could kind of like and this happened with every test right was the they did three tests
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:46.320]   um and then I think the thing that's really I think the most amazing thing when I was reading
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:52.720]   all of this was that you know I would expect that I'm wearing a shielded shirt charged or not charged
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:14:00.560]   that I would get you know results right but what was interesting was that the energy itself
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:08.000]   is in is an appendent and when you tested the pendant you had the exact same results you know so
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.520]   and this is the thing I just if you can if you want to just walk through like here's the the basic
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.400]   testing the before which is you just the person just walks in right and they test them
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:25.680]   and then this was the emf test against the shirt so they're basically the exposure of the folks
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.320]   remember they get measured here and measured here and measured here but the exposure was they
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:38.000]   basically land a smart meter 3g 4g 5g smartphones they actually hand them cell phones
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.160]   bluetooth monitors you know they basically expose them right to what your daily dose of emf is and
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:51.120]   then they measure them and then they have put on the shirt expose them again yep yes yeah you know
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.840]   you know what was interesting was here's the first one where they used the deca and this is the
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:01.520]   lady's name or this is the tester but you know can you explain like here's like here's the first
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.320]   one could you explain what this kind of means uh you know like here's there you know this is right
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:11.040]   out of the door right we're gonna go ahead and test you I mean yeah absolutely and just real
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:17.760]   quick just for the audience so you find all of the studies in english also on the website all the
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:27.440]   summaries as well as from the e-gift institute also the detailed project um yeah document uh it's
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:34.160]   it's pretty long document just what uh k is now referring to and what he translated with google those
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:40.720]   are the the sub documents uh if you will out of the base our studies so you find all the summaries
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.360]   and all that already in english translate but there's just so much content that's very expensive
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:52.240]   to translate it all and takes a lot of time that's why we kind of haven't translated all of it yet
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:59.360]   and um going into the question there so they have these green areas and then they have blue and yellow
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:12.800]   areas um and um the green area is where you want to be right the green is is uh um is very good and
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:19.920]   it's regulated and 50 is actually the the best measurement out of this what you're showing here
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:31.680]   in the diagram right now and blue would be um actually um already um uh degeneration um and
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:40.000]   energetic deficit so that's uh that's uh quite hard that's worse than than yellow even in yellow
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.880]   is um uh already an inflammatory status um and yeah I think that's what I can say about this here
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:57.600]   right now and then the red is red is like really really red yeah red is red actually um is uh
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:04.800]   that's total deregulation so that that happens if they're it's it's like almost a very rapid
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:14.560]   decrease uh and if that happens with three measurements at the same time it's it's sort of um shows like
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:20.320]   an too heavy load on the system that the system really can't deal with and it's very hard so then
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.200]   that shows in red okay and you'll see that a lot quite frankly you know when people were
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:32.560]   exposed to to toxins for example or to you know herbicides and food or season 137 or to
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:42.240]   yeah even emf right you you'll you'll see several red um dots there okay so so uh as you're reading
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:49.280]   these studies or are looking at this is green is good blue means they got issues or they're
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:56.080]   energetically you know uh got problems uh yellow is there just you know almost there and red is like
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:03.280]   it's not good um so as we read this so you know this is what was interesting philip is that
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   every single test study person that walked in the door were primarily in blue they started out
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.600]   really not in a good shape which is amazing to it so that means i mean literally try to
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.960]   imagine how many like you take 20 or whatever dozen people off the street and all of them test
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.480]   that they're in a degenerative state and why we're all living in this electro mugs
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:30.160]   electro smog soup plus if you don't watch your diet and you're eating GMO and all that other
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:35.680]   stuff you know it just gives us amazing that the general public 100% of them are in a degenerative
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   state according to this measurement so they all come in they're all like this too everyone of
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.920]   these studies they all start off around this eye in the blue and very little in the green you know
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.840]   from a wellness standpoint and then of course the yellow and red so that was amazing out of all
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:54.640]   the studies this is this consistent thing where they everyone walking around and not very healthy
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:01.280]   energetically and then uh so then they basically say okay we're gonna uh here sit in this room we're
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:08.000]   gonna hand you a whole bunch of stuff uh you know that's uh you know that's got EMF coming out of it
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.720]   Wi-Fi phones smart meters running and so forth and then this was the result right here which was
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:20.240]   now all of a sudden you know they went from a bad state which was 30 you know energetically
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:26.640]   deficient in blue and they went to 62 red red is bad red is the worst that you could get so yes
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.120]   right so and then the worded of some of the verbiage years as the graphics show many measuring
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.160]   points are in the degenerative black blue area lack energy however the picture is dramatic because
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:44.400]   of the now predominantly measured values in red and so now it just demonstrates how bad EMF is
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:50.480]   is for us you know i'm wondering Philip just out of curiosity but you know your healer network
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.760]   are they susceptible to this or have they been able to transcend and then kind of like
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.720]   have like their their frequency set where they don't feel it because a normal human being
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:08.000]   we're all none of them had issues with it none of them actually so um i note from my wife
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.400]   crew she actually is just basically transforming uh the 5g frequency already in a heal frequency so
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:22.000]   it's kind of like it's very fascinating and Roman he has i mean zero issues with that i mean if
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.920]   you'd ask him he would even say i mean EMF really isn't a big deal at all it's just like
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:33.920]   we're the big deal that we don't remember who we are and don't don't access our power but
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.000]   you know that's from that perspective it's just you know we we just can't expect of ourselves that
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.440]   we're suddenly right there so it's just you know we are where we are and so let's get bridges that
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:52.720]   help us you know on that path but yeah none of them have any issues with that yeah i mean that's
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.200]   amazing i mean i actually know a friend of mine's wife gets a headache every time she drives by a
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.480]   cell phone tower that's how sensitive she is so it's just amazing you know people react we got to
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:08.960]   get her a heal capsule okay so it's sad right it's indeed sad because they're and and what they got
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:17.840]   what the head scientist there at the Basa Institute says is that i mean he says from his perspective
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:25.600]   really EMF is it's it's really one of the core issues that we're facing you mentioned several of
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:31.360]   course and diet and all that and for him that is really that is that is at the core of the issues
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:38.480]   that we're dealing with here currently yeah so now this is this is now there's 16 studies
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.960]   and they're all like this they all have a one two three all the best studies are like that
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:49.440]   and so these best studies all did this with different products and here it is right here they
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:55.120]   now the third test was they said put on a t-shirt and i think they wore it for a little while and
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:01.360]   then they gave them the stuff right that's correct yes okay and so then then they gave them they
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:08.720]   exposed them to the EMF exactly as they did before and then they re-measured them and and this is
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:16.560]   consistent in all 16 studies on the third test when they're actually either wearing a a heal capsule
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:22.080]   or wearing a t-shirt it was it was a hundred percent green it literally transformed all of
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:28.080]   their physiological responses per the Voldeca device they measured their energetic you know
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:35.200]   electrical resistance at the meridian points and they shifted completely into green which
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:43.440]   you know a shielded shirt won't do that a shielded shirt will well and i've done this research on
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:49.040]   shielding because you can watch my video about how well my house is shielded but a shielded shirt
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:54.400]   will will basically prevent RF from hitting anywhere the shirt touches your skin so your legs
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:58.240]   are still gonna get it your head's still gonna get you know because it's like a shield like a
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:04.480]   Viking shield but you know but a shirt won't do this guys and i just want to point that out it's just
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:11.040]   this is the energy in the shirt doing this and even more so if you take away the concept of EMF
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.680]   shielding off together and you look at the test and there's an exact same test like this i believe
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:24.240]   it's not that one i think this one there's an exact same test where they use the here's the
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:30.320]   the results i think this is from the capsule right yeah here's with the leely heal capsule
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.120]   boom 100 percent in the green so i just want to point that out because you know people make
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.280]   confused it says well that all these results are because they were shielded clothing well no i mean
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:44.880]   you get the exact same results when you just wear the pendant that energy and these frequencies in the
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:52.560]   in the in this device it really does what it's supposed to do i'm just really amazed by this this
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:24:01.680]   is pretty wild anything else i want to add i can i'm just i read all those i was not like wow this
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:08.320]   is pretty amazing yeah and you know i think certainly people are different from each other and here
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:17.840]   we've had probably i think up to 16 14 to 16 test persons but then you know if if you're going into
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:28.480]   an area where there's a lot of um radiation emf right a t-shirt would do more charged t-shirt
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:34.320]   quantum t-shirt he would do more than just the capsule because it also blocks like it sits
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:40.560]   around all your main organs right and it also blocks while it's providing you with positive
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:46.960]   energy because so with the capsule if you're standing right next to a tower it the capsule
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:53.120]   still helps you and you'll have huge improvement versus not wearing it obviously but the energy
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:59.840]   is still so high and it's hitting you everywhere that you know there are then some differences i
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:08.080]   think that can be pointed out as well yeah thank you for sharing that uh okay so that was the point
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:15.440]   that um that i wanted to make it was that you know to me um the methods and materials are sound
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:22.240]   the methodology is sound and then the results are pretty amazing and this applies to the shielded
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.920]   products as well as the heel capsule i believe there's one other test that was done and that was
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:34.800]   the one with heart rate variability this was the i-g-e-f testing all of these tests were done
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:41.200]   by these institute these two institutes in in europe now the one thing about the i-g-e-f was
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:47.120]   they used heart rate variability and so that's that's a little bit different um than heart rate
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.040]   monitor you know a lot of us have these fit bits and things like that but i wanted to point out
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:57.360]   what heart rate variability is and links to these descriptions about bioelectric this i'll put the
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.760]   links for these articles uh in the video description so you can kind of see what the methods and materials
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.480]   were or what the methodology was but i want to point out that you know heart rate variability is a
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:12.560]   variation in time between each heartbeat so it's it's basically it's not heart rate it's heart rate
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:17.760]   variability so it's very different and and the and the devices for this are are not cheap you know i
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.480]   went looking to see if i could get my own and they they run around eighteen hundred dollars as opposed
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:28.000]   to a fitbit which is like a hundred bucks right so it is quite different um and so but i wanted
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.600]   to point that out because this was the same type of test done but this time they're using a different
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:41.840]   device to measure the heart rate variability as people were exposed to emf um before and after
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:46.480]   wearing the t-shirt and you can see right here that this is normal you should have a heart rate
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:52.960]   variability um and then this is what happens when uh you're exposed you kind of it reduces your
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:27:00.160]   variability and that's not healthy and this is what good looks like uh and this is um and then this
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.400]   is what poor looks like and so they started doing all these different tests with different
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:09.520]   individuals this is what good looks like this is what poor looks like um and so phil if you want
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:15.200]   to just talk about like here's the same test right where they took individuals and then they exposed
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:26.160]   them yes so the iGEF they use um measurement devices to measure um emf radiation on one hand so that's
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:34.480]   most of what they do so they tested all of our clothing products for example um for that benefit
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:42.480]   right because they can exactly measure okay so if i put on um my my socks my the quantum socks or
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:49.200]   the quantum t-shirt or hoodie or whatever does that really block um the radiation because you know
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:59.200]   there's we wanted to get the certified um and so they verified that it's it's all um um well
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:08.080]   protected then with something like the Lila quantum heel capsule since it doesn't block emf you can't
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:15.600]   use those devices um you have to do you have to apply a different method and yeah so scientifically
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:25.200]   over the last um one or two decades this heart rate variability uh has become one very accepted
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:31.120]   way of doing that because it has a direct impact on the autonomic nervous system i hope i said
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:37.920]   that correctly right and and yeah and that that's what they then do and they they chose 12 different
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:47.040]   test people between the age of 12 to 80 and then um yeah those people were uh tested and then they
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:54.960]   were tested you know with wearing the product um and they also used different time frames so they
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:01.600]   actually also looked into so how does this develop after five hours how is it if you were the capsule
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:10.400]   for two days and uh or three days even and it got it got even better the longer you were the capsule
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:16.000]   it's important to note though that we recommend it to not wear the capsule at night just because
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.880]   we didn't want to get into too many details of taking spheres out and things like that because
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:27.680]   the the capsule stimulates and we didn't want the people to you know um have a hard time sneaking
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:35.520]   also at night so they would wear them um throughout the day and uh yeah you we this also interesting
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:46.400]   here so because out of those 12 people 11 people were impacted by emf right they were definitely
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:52.080]   and significantly impacted by emf but there was one person that wasn't impacted it wasn't one of
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:57.680]   our healers we have no clue who that person was but obviously there was someone that can deal with
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:03.680]   this in a much better way than all the other subjects so and for that one person also um the
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:12.000]   capsule uh didn't yield any um noticeable improvements um because she was already in a in a very good
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.600]   state right so if you if you're doing good you know you don't need to yeah there wasn't anything
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:24.560]   to yield but for all these other 11 that were impacted by emf there were significant improvements
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:29.520]   shown in the heart rate variability and that's kind of what they tested and it was interesting
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.880]   that they used these different time frames too yeah the heart rate variability testing is is very
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.680]   commonplace in a lot of different physiology studies that you can find on on you know all the
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.760]   different city sites and so that's that's a very common one you don't see a lot of people
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:50.080]   using the Voldecca but this is definitely a common accepted practice in academia so I just you know
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:56.160]   as you read this just want to point out like here's a female 80 years without the Layla capsule
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:01.280]   you can see her heart rate variability is is kind of uh you know like like really kind of
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:06.960]   not as and not as variable as that she's in the not healthy stage over here on the left
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.840]   and then you can see the up and down which I pointed out earlier which was like not the healthiest
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:18.640]   and then she puts on the capsule variability goes up and down which is a good sign her health
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:23.360]   indicators move closer to the right which is a good sign and then there's this leveling out of
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:29.440]   the different aspects right here of the of the analysis so it a definite improvement every
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.840]   one of these things is an improvement except the one which was the person trying to find that one
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.480]   is it in here because I remember I remember hearing about it there's this one guy that walks in right
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:43.840]   that without he was this is without this is a guy with but but yeah that's the whole point right
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:51.040]   is that you've got uh that every one of these tests shows an improvement in heart rate variability
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   with uh the quantum heal capsule so you know again another test done another way done by a second
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:05.280]   institution showing the the benefits of quantum energy so uh you know to me this is this is
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:11.600]   awesome because that's the the key thing for so many people was you know where's the where's the
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:17.520]   the science behind how does quantum energy or actually the first question is does it even exist
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:22.720]   is it a bunch of you know woo woo so that that answer I think is pretty clear we've answered that
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:28.000]   today no it's not woo woo it's a real thing and it has a real effect on our physiology
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.040]   and here are the examples here are the studies that were done here you go here is evidence there's
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:39.200]   no longer a question as to this is real or not and what it can do but uh thanks to Leila quantum tech
[00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:45.520]   for bringing this data out into the market um thank you so much Philip I can't say enough about
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:52.560]   how valuable this is to validate the science of quantum energy in terms of just you know like I
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:57.840]   just said it's so important but here you go this is evidence this is studies that'll show you that
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:06.480]   it does help us so Philip I know we have a hard stop in about six minutes so um is there anything
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:12.960]   is there anything else you want to share uh about about your frequencies and and uh the studies is
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:20.480]   or are there more coming out or anything like that yes so first of all thanks again for having me
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:26.480]   and for also um pointing all of this out here because indeed that's one of those things it's
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:34.640]   really for me it's uh science meets consciousness right and there are these two sides if you will
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:40.560]   and it's it's kind of emerging and it's it's good to see now also for people I think that you can
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:48.240]   quantify and qualify uh these things and uh it's helpful and no we're not at the end with with
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:53.760]   with these studies even though we have all these hundreds of pages here but we're doing more so
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:59.600]   there's there's more in the works um I don't really want to share at this point um what it is that
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:06.400]   we're working on but it's it's exciting it's super interesting it has to do with um with animals on
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:14.160]   one hand but also with with sports uh and also with with little ones uh because you know there's uh
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:22.640]   that's actually another point right so babies and little ones you know we they're exposed to all
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:29.440]   that we're exposed to as well and and all their physiological system is is still really growing and
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:37.440]   uh so there are some products that we have like the the baby hat that that is supposed to help babies
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:43.200]   again we're focusing on on dogs and cats but we want to do more research on that and we'll come out
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:50.800]   with some tests and studies um in the near future in regards to that okay no that's great thank you
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:57.120]   so much so uh yeah I want to just say thank you I'm gonna go ahead and uh put this video out I'll
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:01.600]   put in the video descriptions like how to jump to just talking about frequencies how to jump just
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:06.960]   talking about test results and so now all of the all of the studies that I was showing um will
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.440]   eventually be on the website right so that anyone could read any of the evidence and read any of
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:16.080]   the studies it'll all be published there right eventually yes and from all the studies actually
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:23.840]   already there it's just some of the details of those sub projects because the lila quantum t-shirt
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:30.320]   for example was one big project and there's one huge summary of it but then it had a lot of
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:37.360]   different sub projects right where we tested the impact of cesium to the body or toxic substances or
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:45.520]   immune system things like that and all those details we will put them on the website over the
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:51.280]   next you know let's say three to six weeks yeah I want to point yeah I want to point out again I
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:55.600]   mentioned this in the beginning but you know they didn't just test people against emf they tested
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:01.680]   them when they were holding it um you know a radioactive substance very similar to what was
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:08.480]   done in hilo with my daughter holding uh you know on the end the associates holding a vial of rat
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:15.280]   lungworm virus they also were holding vials of pathogens holding toxic substances while they're
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:21.600]   tested with and without them and in every single case when they were holding them they showed a
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:27.440]   definite issue with you know that it was present with them and then when they put on when they put
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:32.960]   it away or in these or in these in these examples that on lila quantum tech when they put the shirt
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:38.080]   on or how to pendant on and we're holding it uh it showed 100 percent green it was just amazing
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:43.520]   it's like as if they weren't uh holding something radioactive or holding a toxic substance so
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:49.440]   it's just amazing it really is so again hey you know what uh we got a hard stop I know we both
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:55.920]   got me to go to well you know what's thank you so much philip I mean this is a huge huge leap
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:02.640]   forward in in bringing quantum energy technology into the marketplace from the fact of actually
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:09.200]   having a valid institutions third-party testing uh and it's just amazing so I just want to say thank
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.400]   you again this is this is what I've been actually looking for for quite some time it's just validation
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:20.080]   you know so many people approach this from like the woo standpoint but it's like just you know
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.840]   here's the here's the evidence now so we've got evidence I can now point people
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:31.360]   to the studies every time they say anything so that's very helpful really helpful thank you again
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:37.280]   thank you k and thanks for everybody for watching and yeah if you're interested uh you know take a
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:43.600]   look and be engaged talk about it if you have questions feel free to reach out anytime yep and
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:53.840]   so again the uh the website is leleque.com so leleque.com um and then we also are on telegram or phillips
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:38:00.960]   on telegram with a quantum power quantum power group is a call group group uh
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:06.960]   for all things quantum energy and look for a lot more to come on that telegram group
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:12.080]   all right well thank you very much everyone and have a good day thank you philip thank you
