[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640]   Hello everybody, this is Kay Elmer and this is another carbon 60 video and in this video
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.120]   I'd like to answer some questions that I've been receiving go over some viewer comments and share with you some really interesting
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.360]   Information that I got in talking with Martin from Red Lion C 60. So here we go. Let's jump right in
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.980]   First thing disclaimers. I just want to make sure everyone's real clear. This is not medical advice
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.600]   This is not a product endorsement. I do mention products, but it does not mean I'm endorsing them
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.320]   I also don't sell any products myself and I don't get paid to mention products or get paid to do videos
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.260]   And I just really want to make that really clear to everybody
[00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.760]   Also, too, there's links to pretty much everything. I'm gonna bring up in the video description below
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.820]   So if you want to have you want to look up anything just go down there and click that link and there you go
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.600]   So first question that I've been getting a lot of which really really is right here
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.480]   Is this should I load and maintain or should I just start taking it?
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.200]   That's a really good question, you know, I covered dosing in part two of that three-part video series
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.960]   But really what's kind of coming from all of the research that I might have doing is
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.000]   It really makes a difference on whether or not you have detoxed before you start taking C 60
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.240]   And what I mean by that is C 60 is a super antioxidant, right?
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.880]   It's a hundred and seventy two times more powerful than vitamin C
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.920]   So if you take C 60 and you have never detox once in your 50 years or whatever a living
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.040]   Then it might not be a good experience for you
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.080]   And what I mean by that is if you detox too fast your body won't know what to do with all the quad it's releasing into your bloodstream
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.080]   So you might want to take it slow if you've never done anything
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.680]   However, if you're someone like myself for over 10 years 20 years
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.180]   I detox constantly by taking a massive amounts of antioxidants and and doing detox types of things like clay
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.980]   And so forth. So if you've been detoxing and you're pretty good
[00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.240]   Then yeah, then you know and then you buy all means then I would say kind of duplicate the rat study do a load up and maintain
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.920]   dosage there after or if you just want to be careful and I recommend everyone take the conservative approach at first just to
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.560]   See how your body reacts to it. It's just start taking it
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.880]   Slowly and then see how it goes and then if you want to load and maintain later, that's that's you know, I'm totally up to you
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.880]   So along those lines
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.440]   I did want to point out that there's a couple of helpful
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.520]   Instructions out there on the internet that I ran across and one of them is for the load and maintain
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.960]   What the folks here at live pet have done and they're the makers of the champion 60 brand is on their label
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.640]   And in fact, they're the only ones that actually have any instructions on on their labels
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.240]   Which is really nice and they actually have the ingredients list to just like an actual regular product you'd get at the store
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.200]   Is they have this little section right here on on recommendations now?
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.800]   I do want to point out it's recommended dosing for dogs if you've seen the live pet guys
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.720]   They've been on Sarah Westall's YouTube channel, and they've been interviewed
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.040]   You know pretty much the product for the animals dogs and horses is
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.440]   Just as much you could take it as a human
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.760]   Clearly because we're all mammals, right? So but this is their quote product for dogs
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.920]   But it's the same if you were to be human and what they've got is their load
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.000]   Starting dose which is a load up and you can see here
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.240]   I just an example to eighty a hundred pounds be three teaspoons a day as opposed to maintenance dose
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.960]   Which is half of that so what they do is that you load up you take a bunch at first
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.720]   You do that for the first week and then you reduce it to half
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.680]   Which is sort of like how they did it in the rat study and so this is really helpful
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.400]   You can go to their website click on products and it's gonna be right there on that page
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.000]   You can pop it up and take a peek at it and there you go
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.640]   So this is kind of some advice and and again, too
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.040]   I want to mention just like on this one here is that
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.120]   Just always recall that the rat study was a study to see how much C60 they could give a rat before it died
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.920]   I mean it was a toxicity study
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.920]   And so what all of these
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.680]   Manufacturers have done is they've tailored it back because clearly you are not going to try to figure out how much C60 it takes to kill
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:10.040]   You and so they've actually scaled it back. I'm not sure what the scaling back of this particular amount is
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.280]   But right here on if you just wanted to start taking it the other resource
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.280]   I want to point out to you is right here
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.520]   And then what this is what what all the vendors have done is they've done a thing called allometric scaling
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.080]   They've just basically said all right
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.480]   Well, you know if this is if they gave a hundred percent whatever that amount was it equals a hundred percent to the rats
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.840]   And that rat study then we'll just scale it back to 30 percent
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.800]   So it's one third of the dose that was given to the rats and they call that allometric scaling
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.640]   I believe obviously this is allometric scaling, but I don't know what to what percent it is
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.840]   I haven't done the math on that but right here
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.120]   For this other helpful little thing that you might all really like which I thought was cool hard to find though on their website
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.800]   But if you go to Bucky Labs website, and you go all the way to the bottom of the page
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.360]   There's this little link right here
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.080]   That says dosage calculator, you know, you'd think it'd be like up here, you know
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.080]   But anyway, so you have to you have to kind of find it
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.000]   I found it by accident and and so basically they have a dosage calculator and if you read all the stuff
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.200]   They do here right here see factor of 30 percent
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.640]   Alometric scaling there you go
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.520]   They did some math but they built you a calculator really simple because not everybody's in exactly the same weight
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.240]   You know and so just for an example
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.560]   Let's say if you're a 200 pound human being or dog or horse
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.480]   It'd be a really small horse by the way, and you're going to take it seven times in a week
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.040]   You're gonna take it every or let's say we want to take it twice it
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.840]   You know you want to take morning and night, but anyway
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:39.120]   So seven times a week right and you've got this little the 30 milliliter bottle or the 60 milliliter bottle because they're giving dosage
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.320]   recommendations by dropper
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.640]   Then you go ahead and click this button in right here. There you go
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.920]   So if you're gonna take a dose you weigh 200 pounds you're gonna take it once a day
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:55.200]   Then they're recommending, but you know this is their calculation is you would probably take 3.3 dropper squeezes per dose
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.080]   Right really helpful, and you can change this all up if you want you can go
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.920]   Oh, you know you can basically go
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.760]   You know if you're gonna take it twice a day or once a week
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.440]   There's actually a point this out later in the video, but a lady that was actually taking a whole bottle every Sunday
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.520]   You know that's how she did it
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.760]   So everybody does it differently don't feel bad whatever, but this little puppy right here is very helpful
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.760]   If you just want to calculate the dose based on alimentary scaling as opposed to trying to use it
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.760]   You know like some kind of a chart and do the math yourself
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.600]   So it really helpful of course the only thing that's kind of limiting is right here is the dropper
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.820]   It only measures off on two different bottle sizes based on the size of the dropper in the bottle, right?
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.460]   And so it's not really like saying hey, you know how much should you take but but if you did pay attention to this little section right there
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.280]   Okay, they're just saying hey
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.040]   That's how many milliliters of the solution or the oil to take so if you just figure this out
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.240]   If you do some math, it's like five. I think it's around five milliliters per teaspoon
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.360]   Is if you're just going to use a teaspoon kind of a thing for me
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.000]   I've been doing this like six months now. I just squished
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.440]   I just you know squished it into the in it
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.920]   I just pour it onto the dog food
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.920]   I just squeeze the bottle and I just pour it on the dog food or I just pour it right into my my protein shake
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.560]   So I don't really I don't really measure anymore
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.680]   But you know but if you are then this is kind of be helpful for you. Okay, so that might help
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:17.300]   Next thing is how to take it now. This was a really interesting viewer comment
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.680]   I really really wanted to share with everybody and I'm so sorry for the individual who shared this with me
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.160]   I'm so sorry. I didn't mention your name. I couldn't find it was just I couldn't find it
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.320]   I took notes, but I forgot to write down who gave me these comments
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.320]   So if you if these are your comments, thank you very much
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.320]   Thank you because you know what this is all about right is sharing how things are going
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.320]   So we're you know, this is a body of work that we're creating and everybody's experiences are really helpful for everybody else
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.920]   No, so what this individual basically shared in the comment sections of one of my videos was that
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.640]   When we research liposomal products, we find they must be taken on an empty stomach if our stomach isn't empty
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.760]   The liposome combines with other food and goes through the digestive process
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.800]   It's still good for us, but we will not get the benefit of the liposomal delivery
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.880]   So that's really interesting
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.400]   But this is what's better is the part where he says a light war he or she sorry a liposome will pass through it empty
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.520]   Stomach into the little small intestine then through the wall directly into the lymphatic system into the liver than out to the body in the blood stream
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.400]   It's quick, and this is what counts
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.480]   This is where he says and this is what's really cool is he tested it
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.680]   I made liposomal niacin using lethicin boom hot flash for me
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.520]   Niacin in pill form took 12 minutes, but in liposomal form only took five
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:32.360]   So that's a remarkable intelligent awesome way to find out whether or not it works and how it works
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.640]   And what's the best way it works and there you go? I think this was a great comment and like I said earlier
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.560]   I just a couple seconds ago
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.000]   I actually been dumping it into my protein shake every morning and now it's like mmm scratching my head
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.200]   Maybe I should try it on an empty stomach and and see what happens so that's something I plan on doing
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.600]   To see if I can well I've got to be able to handle taking it straight
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:59.080]   You know if it ain't coconut oil, it's pretty hard for me to just take a shot a coke or that coke of the olive oil
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:04.200]   It doesn't taste that great, but good information. He's he's got it tested here
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.820]   This is the recommendation keep that in mind good stuff. I really appreciate that. Thank you
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:13.640]   Now we talk about oils then this is where I kind of had this really cool
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:22.680]   Conversation with Martin one of the one I assume the one of the founders of the C60 red lion brand in the UK
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.520]   And I got I got some great information from him, and I think it's just really really good stuff
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.800]   So I want to share this with you and one of the things and by the way, you can go to his Twitter page and you can read this
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.640]   He's he's he's got it all on there
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.760]   But I just take the excerpts here
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.200]   And one of the things that I wanted to share was when he says that we are the manufacturer of C60 olive oil
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.440]   And I've done extensive research on oils. There's solubility and distribution throughout the body
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.440]   Okay, so here's somebody who's studied it
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.640]   You know he didn't hasn't put out a scientific study that you all can share
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:58.240]   But his comments I think are valuable is he says the high quality olive oil is the only is only oil
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:04.880]   Which delivers C60 product to every cell not even low quality olive oil will do that and it's any great scientist
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.600]   He's actually proved it by studying it and he's got some numbers here in which I think it's are great
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.840]   These are all now these other he says here are the solubilities grams per liter figures for because remember now
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.120]   If you guys are buying a product or you're making especially if you're making it at home
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:25.000]   You know the holy grail of making C60 oil yourself is you want to use up as much of that C60
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.120]   Powder as possible. You don't want to leave it on the inside of the flash or the bottom of the you know
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.800]   Ultrasonic or you don't want to waste it. It's so expensive
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.560]   But it's also that fact that you you want to take it into your body and the only way to do it is if it dissolves
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.840]   Into the oil as a liposome
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:45.800]   Aside from the fact that you know it could just be suspended in the oil and floating around not as a liposome
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.080]   But as more of it, you know as a like a little little just you know
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.560]   Specs in the in the oil. Okay, so if you drink it as a speck in the oil and it hasn't formed a liposome
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.960]   You're not going to get as much of a benefit
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:01.760]   But if you take it as a liposome, it will so you're looking for an oil and a process to basically quote dissolve
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.520]   And her make it all into liposomes, right?
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:10.800]   And so this guy I studied and he gave me some numbers and these are different olive oils that he says that has been tested
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.720]   And I asked him how did you test it and he said through HPLC, which is high-performance liquid
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:22.680]   Homiography so he's obviously got the equipment that I kind of don't have obviously never will have but he's got the equipment
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.720]   and he's able to actually tell you know, which oils do the best job of
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:36.680]   Suspending or not suspending but dissolving the C60 in it to give you the biggest bang for your buck on when you're using C60 powder
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.280]   And making your own or you know
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.200]   Also something to think about when you're trying to buy a product that's got C60 in it
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.600]   And so this is what's interesting is he's tested these four that he showed me
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:55.360]   And you know, look at this one. There's this one olive oil brand or I olive oil type that has a solubility 5.97 grams per liter
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.480]   That is huge if you remember from my three-part video series
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:06.760]   I mean the rat scientists they weren't out trying to figure out the best C60 oil they could make right?
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.120]   So they were just trying to poison rats with C60
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.200]   So they weren't you know, they weren't as focused on trying to make the best product as they could so they just you know
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.680]   They just got some of the they they used a an oil. I'm sorry a olive oil
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.400]   derived from Kimlally
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:28.520]   Tunisia, right? It's Kimlally olives from Tunisia is what they used and that's just what they used
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:35.320]   But here's an individual who's actually tested various oils is stating that olive oil is literally the only oil
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:41.040]   That that is that does it that does the C60 to every cell in your body that could deliver it
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:48.080]   And he's tested various different types of oils and here you've got one that's literally almost can can hold six grams per liter
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:54.760]   Which is amazing because if you remember in the rat study, what did they say that they only could hold one actually point eight grams per liter
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:01.280]   That was that that was their solubility factor for the oil. They were given the rats, but here you can get a six times that
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.640]   Using this oil, but you know what's even more interesting is if you read his website
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:11.360]   He uses olive oil press from Corona, Nikki. I don't know how to pronounce that
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:17.440]   But those are the olives that he uses and so I usually I love finding really smart guys
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.840]   I've done all the testing themselves have the numbers to show it
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.640]   And I kind of like to you know kind of copy that so right now
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.340]   I'm going to finish up the the the can of oil that I've got but my next
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:34.640]   Purchase is going to be this this word or word that is and I'm gonna be using that oil just to see how that goes
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.880]   So I thought that was really interesting wanted to share that the other thing that Martin from Red Lion had to say which is
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.940]   Equally is important, and I think this is something that's
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:51.840]   Undoubtedly, you know something we all should be thinking about is is is the reality that you know when you look at lipodomics lipodomics sorry
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:59.440]   We'll show many oils to be the main lipid source for the body, but olive oil has a high content of mutha's
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:06.320]   Particularly octa did not acid and olec acid we have tested dozen of oils and solvents
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:11.720]   But the solubility is not the problem. It's a libidomic problem, and he's got some
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:17.200]   He's got some links here to basically back up his claim links are in the video description below
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:23.020]   So remember now we're taking we're taking the C60 for those you guys making it and the manufacturers themselves
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:29.920]   They're taking C60 they're putting into a fat in all in oil, and they're subjecting the oil to an
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.820]   energy source either through
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:37.640]   Stirring or you know ultrasonic shaking and they're creating this thing called a liposome with the right right inside
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.640]   It's going to be the C60 molecule
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:46.880]   So this is what's really really interesting because I've been storing up and collecting tons and tons and tons of science studies
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.100]   And he's hitting on something that I just recently was reading which is the idea
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:59.800]   That when you create these liposomes that you're not that that the possibility that the C60 molecule by itself
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:06.680]   If you were just to drink it in water would maybe possibly be toxic, but because you wrap a fat cell around it
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.760]   It becomes not toxic because it becomes a separate
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:19.400]   Compound it's an actual you've actually changed it and it's become something different and that in that the idea of how well C60 works
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.680]   It may not be just for the fact that just taking C60 raw like a powder
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:29.920]   but the fact that you put it into a into a into a fat cell or a liposome and you actually create a
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:36.280]   New compound and the issue here at this point is not so much how well C60
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:44.640]   Absorbs into the olive oil, but more so the biggest challenge of making sure that you get the most benefit from C60
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.840]   In oil is that how your body absorbs that fat cell or that fat liposome?
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.160]   So that I think it's a rule rule. I'm going to be doing a lot more study into liponomics
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:00.320]   Because I think that he really hits on a on a flag here that that really the idea is not so much
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.920]   How well you make this the solution which is important, right?
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.400]   But the fact that how well does your body absorb it?
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.800]   So real interesting stuff. This is just the tip of the iceberg wanted to share it with you
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.640]   Because I knew that all of you guys out there are interested in this stuff. You're taking it
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.400]   So obviously you want to know more about it
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.840]   So now the next thing is on using ultrasonics. I chatted with him about this
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.480]   And this is some great information because I'm always out to try to improve how I make it
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:29.360]   Talking with Martin from C60 red line. He says if you're using ultrasonics
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:35.200]   I know this might be difficult but to try to find an ultrasonics machine of 28 kilohertz or lower not the
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:41.120]   Not the normal 40 kilohertz, which is the machines I have been using and then he says and he gives you the secret sauce
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.280]   21 kilohertz is excellent
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.600]   And that's amazing and then he warns me then and in further on along the conversation
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.760]   He says beware that timing is critical and these are my words. I forgot what he wrote
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:57.600]   But he basically says liposomes will break apart if you're subjected to ultrasonics for too long
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.200]   so
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:04.000]   Real important part and so you know this was great timing by the way when I had this chat with them
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.720]   Because that first one broke if you remember from my video
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.720]   And so I had to go that use that little jewelry clean little white one, but I had a bigger blue one
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.440]   And that one broke and on the first try
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.480]   So I was about to order my new one and when I read this or when I hit and I chatted
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.280]   I was able to and he actually makes a
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.800]   Common here that's difficult to find and he's right. I had to look at about 20 different models
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.400]   to find an ultrasonic machine that
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.640]   I could get as close to 20 as I could. I actually finally found one
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:41.200]   And I found it on ebay and I went ahead and bought it's like 119 bucks with $20 shipping
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.040]   that actually
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.080]   Has it goes 20 kilohertz or 40
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.640]   That's the closest I could get to 21, but you know, I'm even basically I'm using
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.560]   You know off the shelf equipment not scientific lab equipment
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.200]   So I can't tune into a specific frequency, but I think it's really it's close. It's 20
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.000]   And so I've got my new ultrasonic cleaner this week
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.320]   I'm really excited to start using it and I'm really going to be doing to be start making
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:13.200]   Ultrasonic C60 oil olive oil using 20 kilohertz and see how that goes
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.240]   Also, too
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.040]   I did get some really great comments from viewers about
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:23.600]   When I did my CBD video about putting a glass flask in an ultrasonic machine
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.600]   The viewer was adamant and and I want to share this with that. Don't put
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.440]   the flask straight on the bottom of the machine because that's where the
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.720]   I forgot the name of those things inside the
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.280]   the jewelry cleaner thing
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.080]   Transducers I think when those things vibrate, you know, that could literally shatter the glass
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.640]   So two key two key takeaways was one
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.440]   Use the basket all those things have a basket they come with so put it in the basket
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.720]   So it's not literally sitting on the bottom of the ultrasonic machine
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.160]   And the second thing that I want to add to that is always use
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.560]   Lab glass do not use like a glass out of your out of your cupboard
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:07.920]   The glass flasks that you've seen in my videos are those Borcelic glass flasks that are made for labs
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.520]   Are made for high temperatures low, you know, they're not going to crack very easily
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.600]   They can take a lot of wear and tear just like um
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.760]   Whatever that other product is that we all have in our house, right? So
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:24.960]   Uh, so just make sure you use uh quality class products put them in a basket and don't go too long
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.960]   So, you know, I was thinking about what is too long
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.000]   Couldn't quite get it out of him. Yeah, I don't I know that you know, he's this is all his secret sauce
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.440]   So he didn't want to share it with me
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.280]   So, um, but I think that I'm gonna be doing my next batch
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.600]   And I think what I'm gonna do is really watch it really closely by the way my new machine
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:47.840]   It has it I can just I can set the timer for as long as I want which is great because I don't have to keep running back to it
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.640]   But um, I'm thinking that I'm gonna watch it and I think that right at the moment that it turns dark
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.000]   Just let it go a little bit after that and stop, you know, it's kind of that's my guess
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   I'm guessing here, but I'm gonna give that a try and lastly, you know, I want to point this out
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.880]   This is real interesting
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:05.520]   He did mention that red lion mixes their product for three to four weeks
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.000]   I was like wow, you know, everyone else is like doing two weeks, but this is amazing
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.480]   So because he's the only product that actually turns red
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.280]   Uh, apparently if you keep going after the two weeks and and you know, you do it
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.480]   Just the way he's doing it, you know, the actual oil turns red
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.840]   Which is if you know what the color spectrum light and this color spectrum is and everybody uses
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.960]   Whatever they're doing and they make this oil and it turns purple
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:35.040]   We'll try to imagine he's figured out a way to keep going so that it goes down the color spectrum from purple and gets to the red
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:40.960]   So, uh, that's really interesting stuff. I mean, I was really really delighted to be able to have this conversation with this guy
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.760]   And the last thing I want to share with you what I got from martin
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:50.000]   Was pulverizing the c60 and this is what was real interesting because I just finished making a batch
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.080]   And I was looking at the flask
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.280]   And you know, there's all these little like grains of sand
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.160]   Um inside the flask after I poured it out, you know, and I hate wasting the c60
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:06.640]   And then I thought to myself wow these little grains of sand are basically clumps of c60 molecules, right
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.760]   You know, a c60 molecule is invisible to the naked eye
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.360]   So if I can see
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:18.000]   These clumps they had to be these giant clumps of of c60 all clumped together into a little green of sand, you know
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.760]   And I was like, oh man all that it's like this is basically you're going to throw this away
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.880]   And and it's not going to dissolve because it is a grain of sand
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.400]   So I was thinking, you know, I should I should you know, try to crush it up like because I have a mortar and pestle
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.920]   You know, uh, I have a rock one and so I was thinking well, why don't I get and I did I actually bought a porcelain
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:40.240]   One that's smooth and I was going to start pulverizing the c60 powder
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   Before I added it to my oil and then all of a sudden I have this conversation with martin
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.040]   And he confirms what I was thinking and I was like, oh cool. This is great
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.560]   You know, he's confirming what I was thinking, which was, you know, that you need them
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.800]   That'd be a good idea and you quote need to
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:59.280]   You should pulverize it, you know, and grind it down to like literally, you know, like the feeling or the
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.520]   The the quality of the consistency of ash. I think it's the best way
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.240]   Uh, and so basically he did say it so he goes
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:12.160]   Because I was you know chatting with him about it and he says well, it's important to grind or actually it's very important
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.480]   Uh-huh, maybe that's how you get to be read grind it in oil for an oxy-free environment
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.080]   So he says this is what he says. It's really important to grind it, right
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:24.960]   Obviously to get the most out of it, but then he's also he also warned me to that
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.320]   It was really susceptible to oxygen as well as light
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.920]   So make sure that you've you've got the whole thing in a little bit of oil
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:38.320]   So that it the c60 doesn't touch air and why you're pulverizing it and so he actually says that he pulverizes
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:44.400]   He's got apparently got some kind of machine that does this and he says we pulverize the c60 millions of times over a week
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.560]   And pulverizing it increases the frequency of c60 whole another subject
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.880]   Uh, and I might sell this
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.840]   He says I might sell this pulverized form of c60
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.320]   Not not in the oil if I thought people would buy it
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:02.320]   So I actually did hit him up for it. I was like well, so me some, you know, and and so he says he's uh going to be
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.560]   Set in some aside for me in his next batch and so i'm going to buy a couple of grams
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:12.000]   And start using his i've been buying the bucky labs powder, but man if I could buy it pre pulverized
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.080]   For roughly the same price. I don't know what the price is yet, but uh, that would be awesome cool because it saved me a huge step
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.600]   And obviously you get a lot more out of it. So real information
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.080]   Uh, I mean room port and information just sharing
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:29.280]   Okay, now next let's talk about the other thing that's coming up constantly and and if you um
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:36.000]   You know, if you if you basically been listening to the interviews you know about this already, but combining c60 with hydrogen
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:42.560]   Uh, basically it you get you get a get a huge kick up in in the performance or the or the benefit of it
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.720]   And so, you know, again, just like my cbd
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.400]   Sixty oil video, you know, if you take a look at the benefits of c60
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:53.840]   Just you know, go to google type in health benefits of c60 health benefits of hydrogen boom all these lists pop up, right?
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:59.200]   And so like like um, you can see where there's a huge huge, uh, you know
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.840]   Partnership that goes on between these two they're clearly both antioxidants
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.760]   Obviously, right and so they both kind of do the same thing if not exactly the same thing
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.240]   So as the aerosol one said, you know, it's greater than the some of its whole parts
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.800]   But that's kind of the idea here, you know that okay
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:21.200]   Well, that's what people are saying is that if you use c60 and you drink oxygen hydrogen in suspended in water
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.640]   You're going to get a huge huge huge puff up
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:30.000]   Uh in the reaction you're going to get or not the reaction but the performance of the supplement
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.880]   So, uh, and this has been proven over and over for me personally when I take c60 by itself
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.080]   It's okay, but man, if i'm drinking hydrogen water all day long
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.480]   It's like it's just amazing energy boost
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.920]   Uh that you feel I mean and everybody I talked to that does that
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.160]   Uh says the same thing so and one of the reasons that's uh, you know
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.400]   Is I have path this is because I couldn't find any specific research about this
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.880]   It's just people talking about it and people doing it
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:59.120]   But I did find something that I kind of want to point out some of the logic you can chew on it
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.960]   I'm anybody finds any research on this please share it in the comment section
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.520]   But the idea here is that if when you take a look at uh, the size of antioxidants
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:13.520]   Okay, uh, and you've got you know, you got your regular antioxidants vitamin e coz in coenzyme q10
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.440]   You know glutathione, these are all you know, I take all these i've been taking these for years
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.960]   Obviously vitamin c you've got this carbon 60 molecule. It's 60 atoms. This was 176
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.680]   So it's one third the size of vitamin c, but then when you think hey, wow, you know molecular hydrogen
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.920]   H2 right so it's two atoms. It's 130th the size of a carbon 60
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.960]   molecule and carbon 60 is literally one third the size of vitamin c
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.120]   So it's really this little tiny guy right here
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.320]   And so the the thought the hypothesis
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:50.720]   Is that these little hydrogen two molecules if you got c60 in your body and you drink in hydrogen water
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.880]   These little molecules get trapped inside the carbon 60 and because carbon 60 can
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:00.960]   Breach the blood brain barrier you can go through the walls of everything that you've got as it's in it literally can
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.480]   I mean hydrogen can just literally leave your body right straight through your skin
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.080]   Uh, it goes through glass. You can't contain it if you have it in a glass jar
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.400]   It's going to seep out through the glass. It's so small
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:16.240]   But the idea though is that it what happens is these two basically help each other and help your body
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.840]   Okay, that's the theory
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.480]   I mean the hypothesis and you can kind of tell well
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.480]   Maybe that you know what they're saying that this little dot here, which is a hydrogen two
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.600]   To get stuck inside this and as this travels to your body
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.800]   Uh, maybe something to think about so one of the things I want to share with you was I went kind of like looking
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.120]   Okay, where's the research on this and I couldn't find anything, but I did find this really cool little um
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.760]   Uh
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.600]   Video
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.080]   And it's not working. Okay, here it goes
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.200]   Um, this is cool little video and this is what's cool about it
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:53.920]   It's this is a simulation of a helium atom inside of a bucky ball or a c60
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:27:00.400]   Fullering uh molecule and I think what's interesting is it kind of just gives you a visual of what it looks like
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.040]   I'm turning off the crappy music here. Um, so
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.920]   This is kind of like the the the simulation
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.920]   So the idea here is that the molecule the h2 molecule
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.880]   Which is this is a helium one a little bit bigger than an h2 molecule
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.120]   Uh, gets stuck inside this c60 and as it's in there and it's trying to you know
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:23.680]   Basically trapped in there the c60 molecule is taking it all over the body because it can cross all the different barriers
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:30.000]   And it can deliver literally be a delivery mechanism for the h2. So I thought that was pretty cool. Now. This is um, whoops
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.040]   I just turned
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:35.920]   Turned it off where it got stuck there and so there it's kind of like bouncing around inside the c60 molecule can't get out
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.600]   uh, the little blue jelly balls here represents the uh,
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:46.240]   vendor walls the the radius the atomic radii of of of of the uh, little mini solar system that each atom is
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:54.320]   And so you basically have this little little ball of molecule and you got another molecule trapped inside of it and that molecule right here
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.800]   Is able to cross the brain barrier and deliver this thing. I think that's fascinating
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.400]   I think it's a kind of a cute little visualization. It's the only thing I can find I can kind of
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.720]   You know describe or show what what this what process might look like, but I think it's pretty cool
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.320]   And I think it has some you know, um, it has some possible
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:16.160]   Mechaned delivery mechanisms is that no one has ever thought about before so that's possible one way of doing it
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:23.120]   Uh to you know to deliver. Hey, what are my videos popped up? Anyway, so it's one possibility for you to consider
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.800]   Uh, and if you want to amp up your, uh, you know your results
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:33.760]   So again think about that combining with hydrogen and just lastly right here boom right there the best source of h2
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.080]   Apples just eat an apple
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:42.960]   After you take some c60. Okay, and if you want to get fancier, you can you know get the little machines that make it or use the pills
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.120]   I can actually do a video on that later if you want
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.480]   Um, let me know if you do, but the idea here is you can you know, apples are an awesome source of hydrogen
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.480]   And definitely something to do with c60. Hey, that's what i'm learning
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.960]   Now next thing is I want to just share with you some information
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.800]   Okay, so before I end the video a couple of things I really want to point out so that you guys are out there
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:07.360]   researching 60 and interested in 60. Uh, there was a great. I mean awesome fantastic interview
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.640]   of fulfill cattle ano and max champi
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.560]   from
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.800]   The uh, the folks that make live longer lab c60 in olive oil
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:22.240]   Um, they were interviewed by a guy from a company called magnawave p emf
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:27.040]   And he interviewed these two guys on february 27 and in this interview. I mean, it's
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:34.080]   Link below. It's awesome because you know what he doesn't just talk about his product and help, you know in his testimonials
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:40.480]   He actually there's a there's a segment in here where he brings on a doctor who has uh, as uh, eye problems
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:47.120]   And and she actually has all of her scans or whatever her test results are showing her before and after
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.400]   Of her, you know, this is the lady taking the one whole bottle every sunday
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.200]   Um, a masculine degeneration knows it
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:30:01.600]   Of her eyes and basically she took c60 and you could literally see she shows up the shows the actual results
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   So how c60 has reduced her degenerative
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.560]   Condition down to where she's practically normal
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:13.440]   Uh, and that's amazing because that's what we're missing and everyone's talking about how great c60 is
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.440]   But nobody's proving it. Okay, and so here's some proof if you need proof
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:23.680]   Watch this video. It's it's a great video, uh interview of the two guys from live longer lab
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.080]   So please, uh, you know, if you're interested in c60 boy. Don't miss that interview. That was a good one
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:33.120]   And then lastly, I just want to let everybody know that I had recently updated my c60 price guide
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.920]   I started doing this back last year. I think november or something
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.960]   Just for me and the people I know that were shopping or wouldn't kept asking which ones the the quote best one
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.240]   What's the cheapest one on that sort? So I threw together a pricing guide
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.640]   Um, and I split it off this time and into c60 just olive oil
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.800]   So you can do a apples to apples comparison or oil to oil comparison
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:58.560]   I guess and then all the c60 products in other oils because it does come in coconut avocado and sunflower
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:03.520]   If you're interested in that but here the olive olive oil guys the other brand other other types of oil guys
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.320]   And I do I do uh, you know, it's aligned by price
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.000]   So you can see right here by the best price per ounce, you know, what's the least?
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.600]   Expensive brand all the way down to the most expensive brand
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:21.200]   And what different sizes it comes in and how much and what they uh, uh, claim on their websites is the amount of c60 in the oil
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:27.040]   And the purity of the c60, uh, that's in there and what's real interesting is since uh, november
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:32.800]   Uh, I'm sorry. Well actually since the last time I updated the price guide was uh, january third
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.440]   Uh, you know, I'm keeping an eye on the market
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.240]   And what's real interesting is that the average price per ounce is now 11 dollars and 14 cents
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.160]   And that's down 13.3
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.360]   Uh, over the past month and a half or or two months
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:52.640]   So, you know, over since november till now the the market price of c60 in oil is going lower and lower and lower
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.920]   Because of increased competition and higher demand to and you know to grow the industry
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.640]   So that's a really good thing for all of us who are taking c60 because clearly
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.560]   It's really expensive, right?
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.360]   And so now the prices are going down because more people are buying and there's more people out there selling
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.120]   And so hey, this is really great link below if you want to take a peek at this
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:18.400]   But if you need some help picking out which oil you want, um, then there's a pricing guide that I create that can help you
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:23.280]   That's it. Hey, you know, thank you very much for sticking out this video with me
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:28.880]   Uh, I really hope that the information I come up with is beneficial to you and I really appreciate you
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.760]   Taking the time to watch my videos. So aloha. Thank you very much and have a great day
