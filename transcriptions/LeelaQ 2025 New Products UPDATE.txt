[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host, K Almer. And this
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.400]   video is a 2025 new products update for Layla Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade. And I've got
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.320]   Philip on the phone and he's going to walk through some of the changes that are going to be in.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.360]   Basically, you're going to be seeing them come February of 2025. So hey, Philip, good morning
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:26.000]   and welcome. Okay. How are you? I'm doing great. So how's Costa Rica this morning? Is it nice and
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.040]   toasty? Yeah, it's somewhat here right now. So it's absolutely beautiful. And yeah, I really
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.800]   like to be here right now and work from here. Yeah, I mean, because your primary residence is
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:46.720]   Florida and I saw Florida got just slammed with snow and cold. And so you had to go escape
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.560]   Florida's for sun, which is hilarious if you think about it. Yep. Did you, I mean, did you get
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:00.480]   snow where you lived or? Well, I mean, we got snow pretty much wherever we moved to, even though
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.560]   people told us it would never snow there. And then it started to snow there every winter. But it
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.840]   has never snowed and went to park, you know, in Florida. So we didn't get any snow. Yeah, that
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.360]   was crazy. That was crazy. I just, I was watching the news the whole time. And it was just crazy.
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.720]   That storm was just wild. But anyway, folks, we are here to talk about the new products coming
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.920]   out in February. And so let's jump right in. So the very first thing, Philip, is I heard that
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.080]   you're having you finally got the pet food bowls, a cat and dog food and water bowls.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.160]   So could you, did you want to describe that? And what's that offering?
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:50.880]   Yeah, so the bowls are out of metal and they have a lila mandala on the bottom. It's hard to
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.000]   see here, but you know, when you pour water in, for example, and you look from the top, you will
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:05.520]   see the mandala still. And they'll be charged with quantum energy in a super strong block,
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.200]   as well as with a respective heel for dogs or a youthful cat's frequency.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.680]   Okay, so are all of your products now being charged in a super block or just these?
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:26.160]   No, not all of them, but we're moving a lot of them to that. It will never be all of them,
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:34.000]   because not all of them would be good to be charged in the in that block. I give you an
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.040]   example, the inner piece card, the common rest card, for example, those are cards that we would
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.440]   never charge in that block. Okay, yeah, there's a lot of people, a lot of the members are really
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.240]   kind of attuned towards the strength of different energy, the strength of energy of different products.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.520]   So okay, so these are charged in a super block, which is really different than the other products
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.840]   that are charged in a 2200 block, right? So so these are way more stronger. So it's great. So now
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.600]   you've got your own offering for pet food bowls. They are charged with the heel for cat or heel for
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.200]   dog frequency. And so if you put water and food in them, then the metal will then charge the water
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.760]   in the food, correct? Yep. I guess the primary question too is how long does it take? And because
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.000]   I know the bottle takes about 20 minutes, so is it about the same? But this this is the bottle
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.560]   actually just the bottle? The bottle takes only about 45 seconds to get the frequencies over,
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.360]   but then to have a super awesome water charge, you know, that couldn't be maximized anymore.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.440]   It'd be like 15 to 20 minutes. You know, that's that's my guess. But but already again, after
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.200]   a minute to three minutes, you already have great water. Okay, it just gets it can get better if
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.680]   you leave it in there longer. And the same would apply with it with the with the dog bowl here.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.480]   Okay, cool. And so they come in three sizes, small, medium and large. Okay. All right, so great.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.640]   That's cool. Now people, if you don't own a block and you wanted to have pet food bowls,
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.440]   here you go. So the other one too, now I hear you've got a new new dog collars. So do these replace
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:23.280]   the old ones? So no, it's an addition. It's an addition. So we were just enhancing the offering.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.600]   Yep. Okay. And then these are also, as I understand, they are also charged in a super block, right?
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.880]   And they're just, I guess the question I had about these was, okay, so they're charged in a
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.960]   super block now that's different than the older collars. They've got the heel for dog's frequency
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.240]   embedded in the in the metal of the of the collar. So my question here is, and by the way,
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.320]   they look, they look great. So my question though is like, how would you equate the level of energy
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.880]   of the new, these two new dog collars to, let's say, a card or a capsule? Like, you know,
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.120]   are they, are they kind of apples and apples or like, how strong are these collars in terms of
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.480]   comparing it to the other products? Yep. That's a, that's a great question because
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:19.680]   really just the metal has such a large field. The, you know, the, the other fabric has some field
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.200]   and, you know, we've, we've figured out a way to actually get this all permanently in there,
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   even even the quantum energy. But the, the actual metal, I would compare it to a card, you know,
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.280]   it's definitely not less powerful than a card. Okay. Maybe depending on the size of the collar,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.440]   be even a little bit more powerful than a card. Okay. All right. Cool. So yeah, because when I,
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.520]   I kind of like, I made my own kind of thing, and I was just always trying to tinker around with like,
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.920]   how much metal do I need to, to, you know, do what I want? And I, I don't want to, I want to have
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.120]   enough metal to replicate, you know, the card. That was kind of like, you know, when I make my
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.440]   own stuff. So okay. So these are kind of like the card. And then the adjustable length, you know,
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.240]   because that's a big deal, because I got like a small dog. So are these for small all the way
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.720]   up to like a regular site like German Shepherd? I mean, that's what it means by adjustable.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.480]   Or do you, do you have like any particular size? No, they are different sizes, you know, because
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.680]   there's three. Oh, I see it. Okay. I missed my little mOMO would, would get a different size
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:31.760]   than, than your larger dog is or German Shepherd, for example, but that's still adjustable, you know.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.440]   Okay. All right. If that makes sense. All right. So it does. Okay. I missed it. It comes in three
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.120]   sizes. So this is great. Okay. So I guess everyone's going to be asking now. Okay. So what about cat
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.960]   and say something so because the way this actually, so the way this came about, I want to tell the
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:54.640]   story also is that, you know, we had sourced these dark colors at some point and people really like
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:03.440]   them and all of that, but then, MOMO got gifted, our little dog, MOMO got gifted a color from a
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:10.800]   very good friend. And it was actually this top one there that has the hearts. And it was so cute. And
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.760]   we just loved it so much. And MOMO loved it. And of course, we then charged it, right? And everything.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:21.920]   And then, then I thought, wow, this is so beautiful. And maybe this would be a great addition. And
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.840]   then I started checking. Okay. So who has these? Where could we get those and do they have out of
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.360]   the ones? And now, now we have these, basically, and it took a while to get all this source.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:42.160]   And they're very beautiful, I must say. So I'm a big fan. All right. Excellent. And so are you
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.480]   going to be making a cat collar or these could? Well, because these have the dog, the heel for
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.200]   dog's frequency suit. Yes. You know, you wouldn't recommend, right? I mean, I wouldn't use this on a
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:58.320]   cat or no, right? Okay. So no, don't use it on a cat. We have the cat colors and and we have no
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.840]   intention right now and changing that. Okay. You know, maybe people can provide feedback. But
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.840]   so far, the feedback was great. And it seemed that there's no need for additional types of cat
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:16.080]   colors. Okay. If there is, you know, certainly let us know. Okay, great. All right. Yeah, I'm waiting
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:22.240]   for the, because you've got the heel for horses frequency. So eventually, I expect that they'll
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:29.840]   probably be a heel like a bridles and and bits for horses. Anyone ever asked you about that?
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:37.760]   Not yet. You make quantum bits and quantum bridles. Okay. Okay. So now, I wasn't going to ask you about
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.640]   pet food containers. So I know that you're you had of it in the works, but I wasn't sure if it's
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:49.360]   going to come out in February. Quantum pet food containers. Is this? I think we're trying. Okay.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:56.160]   It may be the end of February, you know, it's it's hard to tell at the moment. But we're working on
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:04.480]   it heavily. And the pet food container, the idea is basically if people buy bog pet food,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:11.440]   which a lot of people do, they buy these huge bags. And then you always open this large bag
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.800]   and then close it again. And you keep doing that for a month. Then you, there's just a lot of
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:24.160]   oxidation going on, right? Yeah. And so people like a smaller container. So they open this bag
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:30.960]   once they fill the small container, when then the small container is empty, they fill this one up
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.240]   again. That's kind of how people handle it. And there are these regular dog food containers
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:43.920]   out there. So that's a perfect playground for a pet food container that helps to keep
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:52.160]   the food not only fresh, but also energizes it and infuses it with possibly, you know,
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.240]   great frequencies. So and that's basically what we did. So it's going to be a pet food container
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.680]   that does exactly that. Yeah, you know, honestly, as you're talking, I just realized that
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:10.640]   my process needs to be improved. I have the exact same pride by a big bag. It sits in the
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.560]   bottom of the closet and then I fill up a container, which is this plastic thing. And yeah, you're
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.840]   right. I should make it metal, make it in see and make sure it seals, put some frequency and energy.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:27.280]   Yeah, that's a really good idea. Good idea. Okay, so looking forward to that one. And to see what
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.400]   it looks like when it comes out. So the other new changes or the new products is there's a new
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.960]   frequency, which I want to talk about in a second. But before we get into the new frequency,
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:42.960]   I wanted to kind of cover some of the changes that are being done to existing frequencies. So
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.640]   if we could kind of talk about these three, so I understand that there's a change now to the
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:54.960]   existing inflammation or the I think it's called inflammation support or booster, right? And so
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.920]   now inflammatory support. Okay, so let's talk about these changes. So what's the changes to
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:06.720]   the inflammation booster? Or what do you call it? It's called? Yeah, it's it's I think right now
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:14.080]   called inflammatory support. Okay. And in the future, it will be called inflammatory support
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:21.040]   and antiviral. Okay. And on quantum upgrade, I think we're about to launch this already.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.000]   I don't know the launch date exactly, but it should be coming out quickly and the cards
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:36.480]   are being worked on. The way it works for the quantum upgrade is that we're not so we will
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:44.720]   replace the existing one. So, you know, at some point there will be a switch flipped and then the
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:51.920]   inflammatory support of the past is now the inflammatory support and antiviral. And it is
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.080]   it goes even deeper and it's more comprehensive in regards to its inflammatory properties.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:04.480]   And then on top of that, it actually, and I need to be very careful about how I say things,
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:15.040]   right? So it's it's designed to also help with all kinds of microbial activities or, let's say,
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:24.640]   harmful microbial activities, right? So what what people would would call a virus or a
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:32.160]   bacterial infection, things like that, right? You know, that would be a scenario where I would
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:39.840]   personally use exactly this frequency. You know, if if I get a cold, if I have a I don't know,
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.720]   I feel like I'm getting like a stomach flu or something like that, you know, then I personally
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:54.800]   would use this frequency. So that's what it is designed to support. And I hope people can read
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:00.960]   between the lines because we need to be quite careful in this regard, how we phrase things and
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:09.440]   we can't really make any claims and so on. Yeah, I get it. Cool. I mean, that sounds really cool.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.720]   So you've you've enhanced the the capability of the frequency to manage inflammation,
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:20.080]   plus you've added this other incredible frequency, which is perfect. I've actually been getting
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.360]   questions lately about, you know, like, is there a frequency for X, right? I mean, this issue.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:31.040]   And so yeah, I mean, because right now there's the DNA and cell protector frequency, which I'm
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.920]   gonna ask you about. But that's a whole other kind of thing. So this is great. So this fills in that
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:42.640]   gap on what this DNA and cell thing does as well. Right. Wow. That's so cool. One one addition to
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:51.040]   the inflammatory support real quick and antiviral antivire, by the way, the AL is not part of it.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:57.360]   Oh, I thought that was a typo. Okay. No, it's actually on purpose for, you know,
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:03.200]   Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Regular. That was a typo when you send it to me. Oh, okay. All right.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:10.400]   No, it's it's the way it's supposed to be. We need to always be creative, but it also contains now
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:18.400]   the molecular frequency of CDS plus or some people know it as advanced MMS.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:29.280]   So basically, lowering dioxide, right? So we capture that frequency and added it among other
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:36.080]   things. And yeah. So let's say this way, it went through a rigorous testing process,
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:43.040]   and it's been extremely successful and very encouraging. So that's the reason why we're
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.640]   relaunching this one. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, because that's that's been one that people have
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.440]   been asking about this little second piece right here. Okay, great. So that's going to come out
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:59.680]   soon. So I guess people will know it came out when they see this new title, and then they'll know
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:06.640]   that this now has replaced the old one, right? So in terms of the inflammation. So okay, perfect.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:12.640]   Now, so just to kind of touch back on the DNA and cell rebalance. Now, we just noticed several
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:20.800]   members noticed that it used to be called protector. And then it got changed to rebalance, right?
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:26.240]   DNA and cell rebalance. So with the change of the name, did the frequency change? That's question
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:33.760]   number one. Yeah, it's a great question. No, it actually did not change the frequency. Yeah, was
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:42.720]   perfect at the time we see it as such still. And it was just an act of being ahead of
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:49.920]   regulation, you know, this is just an advice that we got, you know, to just call it differently.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:55.440]   And that's what we did. Okay, yeah, because people caught on to that immediately and that was the
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.760]   questions we were getting. What's, is this a new one? And I'm like, I have no idea. Let me ask
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:06.240]   him. Because you know, if you go to the Layla Q site, it still says protector as if you were to
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.760]   buy a card, but on QU, it says rebalance. So there's a little bit of confusion. So all right, so now
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.560]   it's just a new name that didn't change. And I'm sure that the other site, the other website,
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:22.320]   we'll get updated to. Okay, great, good to know. And then there's another one, another change
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.960]   on the happiness frequency. Can you describe what that is?
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:36.080]   So that has not been updated yet, but it will be updated. So I'm hopeful that by the end of next
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:42.080]   week or the week after at the latest, we will have that one updated as well.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:54.160]   And yeah, it will be a real one to believe, I would call it. In regards to the happiness
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.760]   frequency, not that it is a bad frequency. It's a great frequency, but we've been able to work
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:07.200]   on this one. And there's a lot of, a lot of different aspects that are not covered today that
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:12.160]   will be covered. You know, when we're talking, and again, I'm needing to think how to phrase it,
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.360]   right? Because some words I can't really use.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:25.600]   So let's take me as an example again. If I went into into a depressive state, for example,
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:34.640]   then I would choose this one. If I went into a state of anxiety, or I would suddenly lose
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:45.760]   myself as steam, my inner motivation, my, you know, just having difficulties being happy and just,
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:53.760]   you know, all of that, I would use this frequency for and it's actually indeed designed to cover
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:18:00.880]   a lot more aspects of unhappy states than before, if that makes sense.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.400]   Yeah, yeah, no, that makes sense. I'm just, so this isn't, okay, so the existing frequency,
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.280]   and then you're going to make it better, right? So we're not going to, but you'll have to, I guess
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.600]   you're going to announce it on Telegram when the change happens, since the name stays the same.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:21.440]   Is that going to be how that works? Yeah. Okay, so we'll know that it's been changed so people can
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.560]   try out the new version. You'll announce when it's time to change, you know, when the new version's
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.680]   out, name is not going to change, but it's definitely a happiness 2.0. But my question,
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:37.680]   I'm wondering is, is this an etheric frequency or a molecular one, or like, are you like using
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:43.840]   molecular frequencies, let's say to boost oxytocin or dopamine, but it's completely etheric? Oh,
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.960]   that's really cool. Man, I got to learn how to do that one these days. That is so cool. Okay, so
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.040]   there's going to be a new version of happiness coming out. And do you think it's going to happen
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:59.040]   in February then? Yes, 100%. Cool. Okay, so everybody, we've got within the first half of
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.880]   February. I'm very confident. Okay, so we've got three changes to the frequencies, folks.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:10.880]   It's all going to happen on quantum upgrade. And then are you going to be making changing the cards
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:17.280]   on the queue site for the inflammation and happiness when the new versions come out?
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:23.840]   Yes, this is also being worked on. That always takes a little bit more time though. Okay, so I
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:29.760]   guess that's the timing thing. So you'll see it on quantum upgrade. And then afterwards,
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:36.000]   I guess it'll be available via a card. Okay, that's how that's going to work. All right, good.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.120]   Now, the thing I did want to talk about is this launched a couple of days ago, a new frequency
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:48.240]   called Skeletal and Facial Optimization. And so the early reviews on this field,
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.280]   I don't know if you had a chance to read them yet, but there are some incredible testimonies
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:58.000]   of people who've tried this out in the last 48 hours. And it's just amazing. So can you kind of
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.520]   describe for anyone who hasn't noticed yet that they have a new frequency that's available to them
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.400]   on quantum upgrade? But like, what is the Skeletal and Facial Optimization Frequency?
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:15.440]   And what does it do? Yeah, go ahead. It's an interesting story also behind this one. So because
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:23.280]   there's a guest healer that developed this one, and then, you know, Roman did his magic to it as well.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:29.200]   So I call it a team effort, but the main effort really in development process
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:35.840]   was in the hands of Lynn Teachworth, who's one of the best body workers in the world,
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:46.000]   literally. He's a structural integration body talk specialist and works also with all kinds of other
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:53.600]   methods. So he constantly works on people and actually has worked and is still working with
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:21:03.440]   world champions in water skiing, wakeboarding, NFL, NBA, you know, he worked with Michael Chang
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:12.720]   and other tennis pros. And he also teaches all over the world because he's so good and sought after.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:24.400]   Now, that's all he does pretty much that he's trying to get the fascia optimized, the muscles
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:33.280]   optimized, the joints, the skeletal situation improved, right? And he also works energetically,
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:42.160]   not just physically. So he developed this frequency over some time so that the body on its own
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:50.160]   would basically move towards this optimal state as far as, you know, the nervous system goes and
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:57.360]   the skeletal and fascia, the cranial bones, the connective tissues, the vertebrae.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:07.680]   And yeah, so then we talked, he's actually a good friend. And he tested it also with me.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:15.120]   And then we said, yeah, hey, we'll look into this. And he then actually really worked on improving it
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:21.920]   and had it finalized then. And then yeah, it was just an amazing frequency that then
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:29.520]   Roman also worked on a little bit. And then it was final. And this is what it is now. And
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:38.080]   the way that we felt that before I let you talk about the testimonials also is that really people
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:47.520]   feel that they uplift more, that they feel lighter and more elastic in a way. And it's just a nice
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:54.080]   thing. Because in today's world, most of us, we can't do yoga all the time or run around at the
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:23:02.400]   beach and things like that. We sit a lot, right? And we hold our phones, we are on the laptop and
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.920]   things like that. It's all something that's really not that good. And then if you're an athlete,
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:15.280]   a different thing, you're overusing your body and then you get issues from that. So it's all about
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:21.200]   helping with any of such states. And yeah, so that's that.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.600]   Well, that's amazing. That is amazing. So like, how did how did you feel? Because you're a yoga
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:31.280]   guy or you're a yoga instructor. And I mean, when you used it, how did you feel when you
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.640]   turned it on the next day? Because that's what we're hearing. We're hearing that the next day
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.920]   after you turn it on is quite a quite a different adventure in terms of just the improvement people
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:50.400]   are feeling. So I feel I feel more physical expansion within my body. I feel it's it's easier to move,
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:57.040]   easier to stretch. And I feel a little bit uplifted by it. So that's those are the main
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:03.520]   main things that I notice. Okay, no, that's fantastic. And people, if you haven't tried it,
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:10.800]   try recovery also. You know, maybe say that, you know, it does also help with with muscle recovery.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.720]   Yeah. Okay, no, that's great. So every get out there and try it, everybody,
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:20.480]   it's a brand new frequency available now. Okay, so the next one here that is coming this month,
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:26.320]   right? As I understand, is the quantum energy practitioner course. So now that we've got more
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.560]   details on it, I was wondering if you could, you know, just if you wanted to share more details
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:35.040]   about it, and then I'll just kind of ask questions along. But this is the, I guess, the product
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:40.000]   information that I got on this and and it's coming soon. So and we are getting lots of questions
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.760]   about it. So I mean, so like, where are we on this? And can you describe it a little bit more in detail?
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:54.720]   Yeah, I'll try. So again, the idea was that it gives people the chance to learn a little bit
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:02.080]   deeper about how to use this tech to help themselves and help other people. And at the same time,
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:13.840]   provide a framework that people can use then to also be certified and and and use this more
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:19.120]   actively and proactively in their own practice. Or if they don't have a practice, then at least,
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:26.480]   you know, to be able to maybe start to do this on the side and help people with this, right? So
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:34.880]   that's that's this, it provides this framework. And it's a course that guides through how to
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:45.280]   use these products, but it also helps to. So it helps people understand how it works with energy
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:51.840]   perception. It helps them train it and practice it, you know, how to how to perceive energy better,
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:26:00.000]   how to perceive issues that others have even better. There's meditative aspects. There's
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:07.440]   aspects of the the chakra system included actually even with guided meditations by myself that that
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:20.320]   I recorded personally, not AI. It was really me. And yeah, and I think then it in the end of the day,
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:27.520]   when you're through this here, then, you know, whether you need the certification order to
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.600]   practice it, or you just did something for yourself that you haven't even more comprehensive understanding
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.240]   of it. And not just an understanding from the brain, you know, there's obviously a lot of
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:46.160]   information also to take in regards to that. But it also gets you more into the this feeling state,
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:53.200]   into into feeling this energy into perceiving the energy. And that's what a lot of people
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:59.440]   had asked for. And that's why we have it. And you know, one module just builds on each other. And
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:05.760]   then in the end of the day, you're you're done with it, and then you can leverage it. And I think
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:11.200]   it's a really good course. I'm happy with it. I mean, we've worked for two years on it.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.960]   Well, so this is a this is a creation by the Lele Heeler Network, right? So it's a it's a group effort
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:24.400]   by numerous different I'm just asking if it's done by them. And it's a group effort by numerous
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:31.200]   different energy workers from all different facets of the concept, right? No, it's it was just me,
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:36.800]   just you. Okay, so this is from you. But I mean, I might say, of course, you know, I've I've been
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:44.320]   influenced by not just me, but all these healers and others, of course, over the course of my
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:50.000]   development. Yeah, right. Yeah, no guy. Well, I think I think that's that's remarkable,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.280]   because even then you are your own healer network. I mean, I don't know if people realize what
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:00.400]   Philip is actually a trained shaman. You're a Kundalini instructor, you're an energy worker.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.800]   I mean, you've got all of these backgrounds that, you know, every time you get an interview,
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:10.880]   it seems like the people that don't know you, they just hone in on you being a former vice president
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:16.720]   at T-Mobile. But when I talk to you, I'm you know, I hone in on the fact that you've got this
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:23.120]   incredible diverse background in just being a healer, which I think is way better than whatever
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:28.960]   you did at T-Mobile. So yeah, so this is okay. So you developed this course. And so is this really
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:34.400]   good? So for the people that want to learn more that really want to delve into energy working with
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:40.720]   quantum, that's what this is for. And then also for if you are a healer and you want to kind of add
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:46.640]   this to your, you know, your basket of skills, then you know, this is what this has been designed
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:52.800]   for. Is that correct? Absolutely. I mean, any practitioner out there, you know, that maybe works
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:29:01.600]   with as a massage therapist or, you know, you do trigger therapy or cupping or acupuncture or
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:10.320]   what have you, right? All of those plus the healers, whether you do reiki or other things, right?
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:17.360]   For any one of those, I think it could be an additional skill and additional certification
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:23.760]   and an additional offering, right? And for anyone who isn't yet working in this space,
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:34.480]   it's either something you can work on an offer in the future or you just do it for yourself, right?
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:44.560]   That's basically the different use cases, I would say. And I think in this time, it's more
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:54.480]   important than ever that we learn and understand more about our inner power and learning how to
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:01.360]   work with energy. It's not, I think anyone in this community is already doing that,
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.080]   which is so phenomenal, right? But then maybe you can do even a little bit more with it,
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:12.000]   because we're moving into this age, right? And it's increasingly important for people
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.560]   also to be healthy, you know? I encounter more and more people that just are open to that,
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:25.280]   or, you know, I just met here in Costa Rica now a few days, someone that has been suffering with
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:32.320]   lower back pain, like for years and all of that. And so then I had an impulse, you know, this guy
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:40.080]   should should have a yield 360 capsule, right? So I gave him one and he was like, "Oh my God,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:49.200]   thank you so much. I don't know what to do," right? And I've thought about really energy work now,
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:56.240]   because that's sort of the only thing I haven't tried. And now he's been wearing this capsule and
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:02.160]   it's already helping him. And I think, you know, for all the stuff he has, there's a lot of like
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:09.920]   traumatic experiences and deep states of depression that he's been going through. I think, you know,
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:16.720]   he would greatly appreciate if there was someone that could help him, right? So now I don't have
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:24.400]   really the time to take on these things at the moment, but it'd be nice if there were more people
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.920]   starting to offer their help to others. No, that's, no, you know, honestly, that's a really good idea.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:35.440]   I never thought about it from that perspective, because, you know, we get, we have a lot of healers
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.520]   in our members, you know, in our member group. There's so many people in there that have so many
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:46.240]   incredible skills. And I think we almost got what we have people from all walks of life.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:53.280]   So now when if they were to take this course and get certified by Leila, then are you mentioned
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:59.200]   in a prior discussion that you're going to create a section of your websites that says like,
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:03.840]   I don't know, I guess, energy, you know, I get, I don't know what we're going to call it,
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:09.040]   but there's going to be a section where people can actually then go and see the list of people who
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:16.960]   have opted to be put on the registry of certified healers so that when people come to Leila and
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.520]   they're asking questions about the tools and the services, but they actually want to work directly
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.800]   with somebody, then then people like myself can then refer to them to, hey, check out this list.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:32.160]   These are certified healers and they've taken the course and there'll be a list of them. Are you
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:37.840]   going to help like kind of promote them that way? Yes, exactly. That's what we're going to do. And
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.400]   of course, you need to want that, right? Because there may be some people that don't want to be
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.840]   mentioned on the website, but there are others that really want to and that increases their
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:53.520]   exposure. And yeah, we're absolutely happy to do that and are working on that.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.920]   Yeah, no, that's great. Because yeah, there's so many people that come in with all sorts of unique
[00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:04.080]   individual personal problems. And you know, I, you know, I try to help people as much as I can,
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:10.800]   but I can't offer medical advice. I can't, you know, you know, I'm so limited and I know a lot of
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:16.960]   people are limited in that capacity as well. And I don't have anyone to refer them to. So this is
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:22.160]   going to be awesome. You know, and this is going to be great to basically, you know, take that extra
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:27.680]   step to help people when they come into the group to, you know, just at least work one-on-one. So
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.360]   great. Hey, so if you're a healer, folks, you know, you want to sign up for this,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.960]   get certified, get, get promoted on the on the Layla site to the, you know, we have a, I mean,
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.200]   Layla's got a huge customer base. I think it'll really help. And then at least we'll be able to
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:47.520]   then get people one-on-one assistance, you know, through this program. Great idea. Okay, so, but,
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:52.320]   you know, the one last thing, though, is now you've mentioned that there's an exclusive offer. So
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:57.680]   right when you launch this thing, you're going to offer a really big discount, right? So, and
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:02.000]   that's going to be at, what, 200 bucks off the, off the course cost? Is that it?
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.720]   Yes, you're catching me off guard because I think last time we talked, I still knew exactly, but
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:15.600]   I don't know that the price right on top of my head at the moment, but yes, it's about a $200
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.320]   discount for the early release. Okay, yeah, I'm just, I just, yeah, I just
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:25.840]   grabbed the product info for the, for the deck here. Okay, so then the main thing is if you,
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.400]   when this thing launches and you want to take advantage of the enrollment offer,
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:36.080]   make sure you sign up for the newsletters at LaylaQ.com. So, if you go to that website,
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.160]   there's a little thing on the bottom that says sign up for newsletters, and then you'll be,
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:44.880]   you'll be on that list, you'll get notified, and you'll know when the course starts,
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:49.040]   and then of course the enrollment offers there for you. So, now this is great. I'm looking forward
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:54.800]   to this. It's going to be a great thing. So, yeah, thanks for that. So, thank you so much for your
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.520]   time this morning. I really appreciate it. I'm really excited about the new course that's coming out.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:02.960]   I'm definitely going to be doing that. And, and the new products, I think, are awesome,
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:08.240]   the new frequency and the changes. Again, awesome. Philip, thank you so much for your time this morning
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:14.560]   and sharing this with us. Any parting words, any thoughts? Thank you, Kay. A big, big thank you
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:22.240]   for all these amazing videos and interviews and giving us the chance to, to talk about it,
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:28.720]   and then the community to listen to it. That is fantastic. Thanks to everyone else out there as
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:36.720]   well. You know, the times are very dynamic at the moment. And I think they may get a little bit
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:44.240]   more dynamic over the next few months. So, stick with the energy, keep up the great work of,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.720]   you know, unlocking your inner power and helping others with that. And, you know, this will be
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:57.520]   a big theme over the next year or two. I think a lot of people will realize that are in this
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:06.320]   community that many, many more people will wake up to this fact that, you know, we're all energy
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:14.480]   and frequency to begin with. And everyone that has done already so much work is sort of a role
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:21.360]   model out there. And it can be, right? And I mean, that really in a very humbling or a humble way,
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:26.720]   right, not to be a role model of, hey, you know, you got to do it this way. No, but because others
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:38.000]   will seek answers, others will seek for ways on how they could, you know, get out of the
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:49.120]   matrix in a way. And you do that by really unlocking your own access to your consciousness.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:55.680]   And so thanks for doing that. And I really appreciate the whole community.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:03.760]   Oh, thanks, Philip. This is, yeah, I mean, I get it. We are definitely transitioning towards new age.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:09.840]   I mean, I get it more and more every day that, you know, things are changing at a much different
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:17.120]   level than people realize. And yeah, this quantum energy stuff is just amazing. It is amazing.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.840]   But thank you for your time looking forward to all the new stuff. And just want to say thank you
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:25.360]   and have a great day. Thanks, K.
