[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and this
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:12.880]   video is a carbon 60 video specifically how to make a C60 oil my 2024 update. Several subscribers
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.880]   have asked me to share how I actually am doing it now after all these years of me taking and making
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.320]   C60 oil and so this is that video. This is how I do it now and this is everything I've learned
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.600]   over the last seven years on how to make it. This is a tutorial so what I want to kind of point out
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.320]   though is that it's kind of broken into two parts part one and is a detailed information on all of
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.400]   the equipment you use the economics of it the type of oil you should choose where to get your C60
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.840]   powder that sort of thing and then part two is an actual demonstration video. I'll put timestamps
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.840]   in the video description below if you just want to jump to the demonstration video and just you
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.360]   know so you can see all the different steps and visualize it. Also too I want us to say that you
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.640]   know again you know as I said in all my other C60 videos that C60 oil is not approved for
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.200]   consumption by the FDA it's still not approved and that you understand that making and consuming
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.080]   C60 oil is experimental and you do so at your own risk okay so as I've said in every C60 video
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.360]   we are the human trial and we are still after all these years still the human trial there's no
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.480]   C60 human trial that's been published yet so now do you want to caveat that this tutorial is for
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.080]   people who are completely new to this you know so if you have if you just are interested in making
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.120]   your own C60 oil this is your tutorial for those of you who've been making it for a while and you
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.520]   you get it all and you've been doing it as long as I have then you know this is just going to be
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.240]   preaching to the choir all right so you can save yourself some time but you know I really wanted
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.360]   to make something for people that are new to it because I do get off often asked about that and
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.480]   so here you go everybody this is the tutorial now very first thing that everyone should understand
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.440]   if you want to make C60 oil is that there's a particular formula that the industry is following
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.560]   now it is not the end all formula for all the different ways you can make C60 there are numerous
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.840]   other ways but this one is going to center in on the way that I make it and I make it based off
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.640]   of the original way that the study that there's this 2012 study norm you know it's affectionately
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.320]   called the rat study called the prolongation of lifespan of rats by repeated oral administration
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.560]   of 6 of C60 fullerene and this is the study that kicked off C60 as a health supplement
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.800]   so this has been going on since 2012 there was a first group of early adopters that started making
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.640]   it and taking it and there's about maybe seven or nine different companies that actually made it
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.400]   and then it totally took off in 2017 and so I'm in that second wave of early adopters and that really
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.080]   got into C60 in that second wave of early adopters that really started getting into it making their
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.440]   own and and so forth and now there's just numerous companies that make it but this is that that
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.880]   formula came from this study and that formula basically breaks down into this and this is your
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.360]   C60 oil preparation state so now that rat study also known as the body method is basically a
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.040]   six step process so now they did it in the study and that's of course you know the rats lived twice
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.240]   as long and you know you've heard that you know that's why you're here so that whole rat study is
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.000]   everybody kind of wanted like oh hey the rats lived twice as long and they didn't have tumors and
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.760]   I want to do that and so that's kind of the six step process for how those scientists made their
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.360]   C60 oil in that study and it was a six step process basically they obtained oil they you know they
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:45.040]   purchased 99.98% C60 powdered it was you know a powdered form of C60 and then what they did was
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.360]   they added 50 milligrams of C60 to 10 milliliters of olive oil and so what in in essence they just
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.000]   put five whole grams in a liter and then threw away all the rest of the C60 that didn't saturate
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.920]   into the oil huge waste of money C60 is so expensive you that's why you know you don't want to you
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.400]   want to follow their steps which you don't want to do exactly what they did because you know they're
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.960]   scientists they're not paying it for anything out of their own pocket right so but we are and it
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.960]   makes a huge difference so you know but that was their basic formula was 50 milligrams per 10 liters
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.480]   you know if you break it down to how they did it in their lab now they stirred it for two weeks in
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.400]   a lab which is a cool temperature and in the dark you know normal laboratories are usually
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.120]   running around 70 degrees and then they actually centrifuged it at 5g for one hour and then after
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:44.560]   they centrifuged it then they filtered it through a 0.25 microgram or micro milliliter my actually
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.800]   it's called microns filter okay and that then that that was their process and then that way they
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.000]   came up with a consistent C60 oil to use in their study and they gave that to the rats and the
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.320]   rest is history now for your do IY you know you do it yourself at home method I call that the
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.520]   simplified method and I've been doing this for years okay I've made dozens of batches
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.160]   and I've tried it all sorts of different ways and I've got tons of little videos and
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.120]   on all the different crazy things that I've tried in terms of making C60 up to and including hand
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.120]   hand blenders in my kitchen so but this is the way okay so this is how I make it now I do this
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.600]   is what I do consistently this is everything I've learned after seven years of doing this
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.320]   and dozens and dozens of batches this is what works for me now obviously step one
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.480]   get some olive oil step two get some C60 step three put some C60 in the oil you need to kind of
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:43.840]   know how much to put in and how much is following the rat study which is adding 0.8 grams per liter
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:50.640]   if you're using olive oil or 0.4 grams per liter if you're using MCT or coconut oil now the 0.8 grams
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.440]   also applies to avocado oil and if you look at what people are out there selling they're selling
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.440]   dozens of different kinds of oils but just want to caveat that olive oil has been proven to be the
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.560]   best oil to use with C60 above all other oils okay just in terms of how much C60 it can hold and
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.960]   there's incredible health benefits to just olive oil by itself now the thing is is I also stir for
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:21.680]   two weeks but then I actually stir on a hot pad stir and so I've learned over time that it's
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.280]   you know oil any oil is quite viscous it's thick you know it's definitely not as you know as fluid
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.600]   as water and so because it's thick you know I just find that over time that if I heat it up
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:40.240]   especially to heat it up to a specific temperature point 49 degrees centigrade or 120 degrees fahrenheit
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.840]   I'll also keep it in the dark but by heating it up you decrease the viscosity of the oil and it
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.920]   makes it easier for the C60 to saturate into the oil I then let it settle for two weeks in the dark
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.080]   now I don't have a central actually I have a centrifuge I don't use my centrifuge for this
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.760]   but you know I let it settle for two weeks in the dark so that's kind of like the idea of five
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:08.160]   you know geez for one hour versus settling it for two weeks at one g for two weeks you know so it's
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:15.760]   kind of the approach that I do in that settling and centrifuging allows for the suspended C60 that's
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:22.000]   the thing here right even if you stir for two weeks a lot of the C60 will dissolve into the oil
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.280]   but they'll always be C60 floating and they call that suspended in solution so there'll always be
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   some C60 because it's so small and it's really light and it'll be floating in there and you
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.040]   want to kind of let it settle out because you don't want to ingest that because it's so expensive
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.640]   that you'll just waste it if you do that but if you let it settle out to the bottom then you can
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.840]   make a new batch and and not waste it okay that's that's why that's that and then of course I do
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:54.160]   filter through a .22 microgram or micro micron I'm sorry it's micron filter only because I've
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.760]   not ever been able to find a .25 micron filter so that's what I do is I filter it now there's
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.080]   back and forth about whether you should or filter it or not I just want to caveat that that one of
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.880]   the scientists that was actually interviewed once that did you know this was part of the group of
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.400]   scientists that did the rat study and he was interviewed and his name was Fati Musa and he
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.840]   actually won on record and said that oh if you're going to do it at home you don't really need to
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:23.840]   filter we filtered because we needed to have consistent you know we needed to have a consistent
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:29.040]   out in a product you know solution to give the rats so that we knew that the rats got the exact
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:33.600]   same thing every time we did it but if you're just not you know if you're just doing it at home and
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.400]   you're ingesting it itself it's really not necessary to filter I've learned to filter because I ran
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.400]   into this weird situation years ago where drinking it unfiltered for whatever reason this suspended
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.320]   C60 in my oil was getting stuck in my kidneys and I was having kidney stone issues and that's been
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:56.720]   well documented in other videos and so I found that if I filter it I don't have any issues with
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.800]   with kidney stones and that sort of thing so if you don't have any problems with your kidneys
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.960]   then you probably don't need to worry about filtering on the other hand do and again you
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.080]   know here out of the rat study I do want to just point out again this is their exact
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.880]   you know right here there's a cold right out of the study and it just basically says again it's a
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:21.440]   0.8 milligrams per milliliter in olive oil okay so that's where I got that number so now let's get
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.560]   into the equipment so the equipment that you're going to need to do this if you decide to do it
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.560]   my way and again like I said there's lots of different ways to do this but if you want to know
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:37.280]   how to make C60 oil and you want to know from a guy who's made dozens of DIY batches at home
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.720]   and I've been doing this for years this is what I have come to the final conclusion of this is how
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.240]   I want to make it and I do this consistently and it works really really well for me so now the
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.160]   equipment that you would need obviously you want to basically have a little digital scale
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.320]   you need to weigh out your C60 that you're going to be adding to the oil I do use a stainless steel
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:04.080]   mortar and pestle because I've also found over time that it's very beneficial to grind it up
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:12.080]   basically turn that granular C60 powder that you receive from wavers and then I mix that with a
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:18.640]   little bit of oil and I just grind it into a silt and by basically liquefying it it really does
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.560]   stir into your C60 so much better you know it just it just mixes in really well it doesn't clump
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:29.360]   and and it doesn't have any other problems that you would have with clumping and so yeah so I
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:35.040]   definitely do what you know I basically call it pulverize the C60 before I add it so I definitely
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.960]   recommend that people do that using a glass beaker which is a straight walled beaker and not a
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:47.760]   conical flask because that also affects the the movement of the oil in the stir and so you want
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.640]   to have it to be a straight wall flask and that makes that makes the whole entire amount of oil
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.440]   spin at the same rate and that just you have a better product when you have a straight walled
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:03.120]   beaker and then also too as I mentioned I use a hot plate magnetic stir as opposed to just a
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:09.520]   regular magnetic stir because of the fact that you know I want to lower the viscosity the oil
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.960]   and have it to be more more fluid so then with the and then of course you need to get a stir bar
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:22.000]   so total cost for just your basic equipment just to stir if you go out there in internet land and
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.920]   you go and price out all this stuff it comes up to about $284 right and also too I'll put a link
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:34.400]   below for my what I call my C60 equipment list I have it on my blog and it's got all of the links
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.560]   to all this stuff okay so I'll put that in the video description as well for any of you guys that
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.720]   you know want to go out and just you know pick up what I bought so this is it though short so
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:48.160]   your basic equipment that you're going to need just to stir and create your C60 oil is going to
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.760]   run you about $284 all right now the other thing now if you decide to filter like I filter then
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.640]   you're going to need some filter equipment okay the filter equipment is pretty much getting a
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.440]   filled what they call a filter apparatus now there's this is just the apparatus that you're
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.920]   going to use it's the tool that you're going to use to filter it you do need to buy your filter
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.720]   paper you put papers in there I'll show you that in the video so you need to buy some filter papers
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   to go with your apparatus and then using a vacuum pump to basically create that suction that you
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.560]   know basically will then filter the oil and you need a hose to connect the two so for the filtering
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:31.120]   equipment it runs about $155 in today's dollars and so now your total equipment costs to get into
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:38.400]   this is $439 and that's just to do it my way you could do it a lot cheaper with cheaper equipment
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.840]   but you're not going to get as good a results and and I'm telling you I I've done this a bunch of
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:48.400]   different ways I've owned like five different stirs if you watch any of my other videos you'll
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.760]   see I tried different filtration processes I've tried different stirring processes with different
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:59.280]   stirs I've tried all these different things and this is what I came up with as what works best
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.480]   okay but so it's going to be $439 it's a little pricey but I do want to I'll point out some economics
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:09.920]   on that here in a second the third thing you're going to need is you're going to need the C60
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:16.000]   and some olive oil and so now normally like the best price that I kind of you know I kind of get
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.520]   my C60 is I get it for about 130 a gram that's with shipping and handling and then olive oil you
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:28.320]   know I basically buy that for about 30 dollars a liter so now every time you make a batch and a
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.680]   batch will last a one person for about three months if you take two teaspoons a day which is the
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:40.160]   recommended dosage so that's the three months supply of C60 and just the oil and the C60 alone
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:46.160]   it's like 162 bucks so it comes out you know roughly 50 something dollars per month just to have
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.280]   you know just be able to take C60 as a supplement so with all of that in mind you know there are
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.040]   there are some costs involved so I do want to kind of point out that you know if you're going
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.480]   to do this and you're going to do this for the long and you know you want to do this in for the
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.600]   long run then this is what I would recommend you do if you just want to try it obviously just
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.080]   go buy go buy somebody else's product that they made but let me show you the economics
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:15.040]   because if you buy pre-made C60 oil okay it's a lot more expensive than making it yourself and
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:20.320]   that's the whole point of this video and why I made a tutorial this is save people money and I save
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.960]   myself a ton of money so now I used to do market analysis and so I haven't done a price analysis
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.760]   since 2021 I kind of just stopped doing it because not very many people are interested in it but
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:40.960]   you know as of 2021 tracking the average price of C60 by the ounce was $13.83 an ounce now you
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:47.600]   could buy a full liter bottle and those run about $290 okay so if you wanted to buy a full liter
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:53.440]   from somebody else that made it for you it costs you about 290 or if you bought it by the ounce it
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:59.680]   be $44 and that would not don't do that you know so if you if you take C60 you know don't buy the
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.040]   little two ounce bottles or the four ounce bottles you know just buy a liter for 290 and it's going
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.000]   to last you three months as opposed to buying it you know one ounce at a time or two ounces or
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.440]   four ounces at a time it's just not economical at all but that's what the actual buy it you know
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.080]   buy it from somebody else that makes it price it's quite expensive you know if you think about it's
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:28.720]   like $290 a liter now if you make your own it comes out to $399 an ounce or $162 a liter that's
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:34.400]   making it yourself and if you did that you would save yourself by the ounce you're going to save
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:41.200]   71 percent by the ounce but if you buy it by the liter or you make your own leaders it's only going
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:47.680]   to cost you 128 or about 50 percent cheaper than if you bought it from somebody else and that's why
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:53.120]   I am so motivated to make my own which I do all the time so that's kind of how I got into it I just
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.200]   wanted to save myself money and I'm a tinker and I like doing this kind of stuff so to give you an
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.400]   idea now if you decided to make your own as opposed to buying it there's a three and a half
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:08.080]   a month batch you know per there's three and a half batches okay so that's almost an entire year
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:14.000]   so if you took C60 for a whole year then you would save enough money to just basically break even
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.560]   on your equipment costs and everything from year two on on going forward you're saving 50 percent
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:25.200]   right because you've got this capital expense to buy the equipment which I don't include in these
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.080]   numbers because equipment is just a one-time capital outlay but going forward after you know
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.120]   after the first year okay you'll recoup all your costs that you've your money that you spent on
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.880]   your equipment and from year two going forward you're going to save 50 percent okay and that's the
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.280]   key thing here is the economics and again like you know it's about going for the long term if you're
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.480]   going to do this for the long term then you're definitely going to want to make it yourself but
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.560]   I just want to point out though you don't really don't start saving money until year two okay because
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.600]   you know you're going to do all that capital outlay for equipment now where to get C60
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:04.080]   there's now this I'll put this in the in the video description as well but basically I still do
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:12.560]   a annual price and now you know price guide I guess for C60 powder okay and so I still do this
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:17.120]   because this is this is what people are interested in now and so kind of just to show you like I
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.400]   haven't done one for 2024 yet but the most recent one was 2023 where I looked at you know
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:30.560]   nine of the most you know the most well known and popular providers or manufacturers of C60
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:37.200]   and you can kind of see the price points where you know back in 2021 you know the prices kind of
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:43.520]   have fluctuated a little bit but not that much but as of 2023 you can pretty much purchase
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:54.240]   C60 for about $127 a gram okay now I use 99.95 C60 I buy from Layla Labs which is in North America
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:01.520]   and they actually source through Solaris so they actually are a C60 oil producer and they buy from
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:07.680]   Solaris Chem in Canada and so the deal we have and this is a special deal for our C60 telegram
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:15.680]   members is that Layla Labs has offered all of our telegram members you know their C60 at wholesale
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:21.200]   so they're sourcing it from Solaris Chem and they're selling it to us at wholesale prices so you can
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:27.440]   get it at wholesale prices for $122.50 a gram okay but you do have there's a two gram minimum
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.760]   and I just kind of want to show you what the huge difference is now if you went to like SES
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.960]   research which is like the you know the they're the big guns in the C60 world along with Solaris
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:45.280]   Chem now and so if you went to SES research and they're going to charge you 249a gram of 99.95 percent
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:55.360]   so 122 versus 249 it literally is half so you could save 50% off of your cost of C60 by just
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.880]   you know by just buying it from Layla Labs you know through our through you know you have to go
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:05.120]   into telegram get the special links for the wholesale price but that's 50% off you know of what SES is
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:10.720]   selling it for now I do want to also point out though number five MTR is another provider of C60
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:16.400]   and they have sales so in 2023 when I ran the study they actually had it on sale that month and
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.080]   they were selling it for 93 grams so I just and they're the only ones that ever have sales I've
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.760]   been watching this for a long time so you know every now and then you know if you're out there buying
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.800]   your C60A you want to buy it in bulk buy it you know more than one or two grams at a time you save a
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.160]   lot more money with the more C60 you purchase right price goes down but every now and then if you
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:39.600]   watch MTR you can get it on sale for even better or than half off okay so that's kind of the point
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.880]   I want to make you save yourself a lot of money by buying it through Layla Labs through our telegram
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:50.240]   chat group and then keep an eye on MTR for their prices when they have sales okay and then the other
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.800]   thing too that when you're buying C60 you know something that's really important that you need
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:01.280]   to keep your eye on is you want to make sure that it's human grade because C60 is its original
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:08.160]   purpose was you know and still is it's an industrial solvent or a lubricant I'm sorry and so there's
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.120]   tons of different industry applications where it's whether it's motor oil or or you name it I mean
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:18.960]   it's used in in in solar panels it's used all over the place as an industrial you know substance
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.680]   okay but it's originally just was a was it was a lubricant because the C60 molecules like a
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:29.760]   little bearing and so now and so because of that they don't they don't like you know treat it the
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:35.520]   same way as you would if you were going to ingest it and so there's a lot more residual toxins and
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.200]   solvents and things like that in the industrial grade because you know they're not worried about
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.680]   anyone eating it however if you're going to eat it you're going to want to get the human grade
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.760]   you know version of the C60 which has been treated in such a way that it's minimal you know it's
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:56.400]   minimized the amount of toxins and solvents that are residual in the C60 to the greatest extent
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:02.160]   possible so that's safe for you to ingest okay and then also to you you know and that hope comes
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:09.680]   down to this whole solvent free you know solvents are toxic and then last one is the the the best
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.400]   C60 you could find is something called sublimated it's just a different way that they processed it
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:20.400]   whether or there's zero solvents in it I mean there might be some trace elements of heavy metals
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:26.160]   in there but it's so it's so small that it's it's it's inconsequential but the idea though is that
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:32.480]   the best form of C60 you could buy is sublimated and that's this you know likes like that's the
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.960]   Cadillac of C60 and the next one down is just looking for something called human grade human
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:43.920]   grade's fine by the way human grade's fine a 99.95 is fine 99.9 is fine I wouldn't go any lower than
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:50.960]   that and that's just a rating of the amount of C60 in the powder as opposed to other fullerenes
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:57.120]   it's not a percentage representation of the amount of solvents or toxins in there it just simply is
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:08.080]   is if it's 99.95 then the powder you're getting contains 99.95% C60 and 0.05 some other fullerene
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:13.360]   okay now the other thing about buying C60 I do want to point out is storage it's so important
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:18.480]   that if you use this thing that you want to keep it you want to keep it out of air you want to keep
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.160]   the air away from it and you want to keep it in the dark so you want to store it so a lot of a lot
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:29.360]   of people and myself included I will store it in the dark I'll store it with oxygen absorbers
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.440]   other folks will just make a mother like if you know for those of you who know how to make you
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.400]   know sourdough bread there you create this mother yeast and so basically some folks just make a
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.840]   mother oil that they'll then use to make other C60 you know to make their C60 oil they'll have
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:50.320]   this super high concentrated jar of oil that's got all the C60 in it and that way it keeps it out
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.720]   of the you know it keeps it out of the air and so that's just one way to store it but you can either
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.680]   store it with O2 absorbers or you can create a mother or you just use it all every time you you
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.800]   buy some just use the whole batch because you don't really want to store it for long periods
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:10.000]   of time and have it exposed to air it will oxidize okay so that's the other thing about having raw
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.920]   60 on hand now we're kind of oil now the kind of oil is kind of just it's it's a great subject
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:20.480]   look I probably did videos on this too but there's actually one study that I did run across in my
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:26.160]   years which is a study called olive oil as a biocompatible solvent for pristine C60 now in
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.720]   there they actually compare different oils and there's other there's one other study out there
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:35.120]   that did the same thing with vegetable oils and they had a whole bunch of different vegetable oils
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.520]   but this one actually took a look at different kinds of olive oil they only looked at three
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:45.040]   and so right out of the study there's this little table solubility C16 different brands and so
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.800]   they tested three different brands and just as I point out the rat study actually bought a brand
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:56.880]   of C60 oil from Tunisia now this one here this study actually looked at three different brands
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:06.320]   and one was called capelli borges and and this other one called otalia otalia and so what they
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.280]   found was these micrograms per milliter was the saturation rate you can see that the highest
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:18.800]   saturation rate was 5.97 micrograms per milliter using a brand called Borges and so this is the
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:25.360]   Borges brand right here and it basically is you know it's a real olive oil and this was found to
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.960]   be the best olive oil that these these scientists had tested now they only tested three of them and
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:35.200]   so this is one of the ones that you could I would highly recommend because of the study that says
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.480]   hey this is you know this is the best olive oil because what this points out to you and me is that
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:45.280]   yeah you can get better results with better oil you know hey and so not only can you get better
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:50.960]   results by pulverizing your C6 and using heat you can get better results by the oil that you choose
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:56.960]   now because I'm sort of like you know I like to be cost conscious there's another oil out there
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:03.200]   that I've been using this whole time and I use brags olive oil with the the one that's the greek
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:09.440]   korneki olives and the reason I use greek korneki olive oil from brags is you know the price points
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.800]   really great it is your USD certified non-GMO blah blah blah right but one of the things too
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:21.040]   about korneki is you know basically one of my acquaintances in my C60 world who's a manufacturer
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.000]   of C60 oils he had done a bunch of tests using different oils he didn't you know he didn't publish
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.920]   it this was just private and he shared with me one time and he you know this is a guy that runs a
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   company that makes C60 products and he just said yeah you know I tested a bunch of different
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:41.840]   types of olive oil you know from different olive olives you know and he found out the greek ones
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:48.720]   called korneki was the best one that you know that was the best for dissolving C60 and so just by
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.840]   going by what he said and if anybody wants to know it's martin from red lion labs or red lion
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.480]   biomedical is the name of his company so martin basically said hey yeah you know I use korneki
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.880]   it's the best one I've tested a bunch of different ones and so ever since I talked to him years and
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.400]   years and years ago I've been sticking with the korneki olives you know for using from for my olive
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:14.480]   oil and and it's also economical it's you know 32 ounces for 30 bucks you know so it's it's
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:19.360]   weight it's not way cheaper but it's definitely cheaper 40 percent off of what you would pay for
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:24.640]   Borgas and it's and apparently according to red lion it's the best one so that's just what I've
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:29.680]   been sticking with and it works for me and that's the type of oil you'd want to choose all right
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:36.080]   so now let's talk about making C60 oil now the very first thing here is that you know these are the
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.200]   steps again and I want to kind of go over that and I'm going to show you the little demonstration
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.640]   video and I want to kind of point out a couple of things if you don't you if you're not aware of
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:48.560]   it because you're new to this but the whole thing about quote the word dissolve and saturate those
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:53.760]   words mean you're going to take carbon and you're going to put it in the oil and what's going to
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:59.040]   happen it's going to create what they call a lipofluorine and a lipofluorine means that there's
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:05.360]   going to be the fatty acid lipids from the oil are going to attach to the C60 molecules and I'll
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:13.600]   see 60 is a one nanometer molecule that clumps together because it's crystalline it's a crystalline
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:19.200]   form of carbon so you get these clusters of the molecules together and anywhere from you know
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:25.920]   depending on what you buy it could be anywhere from you know 300 nanometer cluster to bigger
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:32.400]   and then up and then all of these little lipids from the fat surround that cluster of C60 molecules
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:38.560]   as in the diagram here on the right and it forms like a little liposome okay and all of this is
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:42.560]   naked to the eye you don't see it but that's what you're trying to do and that's the whole
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:49.120]   purpose of making that's what C60 oil is it's called a lipofluorine and you're doing that because
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:54.480]   you're basically putting carbon in oil which creates the lipofluorine these little liposomes
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.040]   and that's what comprises and are floating around in that oil and that's the whole that's what you're
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.600]   trying to do so the other thing that I kind of want to point out is so so here are this that's
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:09.200]   what you're doing these are the steps first thing I do again I say I number one I pulverize the C60
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:14.880]   I add the C60 slowly while the oil is heated and spinning already and that's another really key
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.600]   thing I'll point out in the demonstration video is you don't want to just and that's kind of why
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:25.680]   I pulverize it first because here's an example of one of my experiments where I just took C60
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:32.480]   and this is MCT oil so you could see it you know because anyway and so and I just dumped it in
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:38.000]   there without having the oil already moving and what happens is is the oil I'm sorry the C60 just
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.720]   drops right to the bottom and forms and just comes into this big clump on the bottom and even if
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:48.240]   you start that stir bar you'll never get that clump to break up so don't do this do not just
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:54.320]   dump powder into your into the oil without the stir running already so you want it running
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.760]   and in in my world I want it heated already so I want to heat it up I want it spinning and then
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:05.040]   I add the C60 as a liquid and you get way better results than if you just dump powder in because
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:10.320]   if you just dump powder in to your beaker and then start the stir you're going to get this huge
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.720]   clump on the bottom and it's not going to be a very good end result so then again I heated up to
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:21.440]   what 120 Fahrenheit 49 centigrade I set the spin to 700 rpm I cover it with cling wrap to keep the
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.360]   air and dust and and anything else out of it while it's spinning because it's going to be spinning
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.720]   for two weeks I keep it dark I spin for the two weeks I settle for the two weeks and then I filter
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:36.560]   there you go so here we go let's do the demonstration video I'll do it's do a voiceover all right so
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:43.600]   here is the brags olive oil that I use I've got my my my my hot plate stir I've got my stir bar in
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.280]   there ready to go and so one of the key things here is that you know you want to
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:52.400]   just start this is the starting process here basically it's cold everything's cold nothing's
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:57.360]   been heated up yet I just want to get it stirring and then I want to start heating it up and so the
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:03.040]   key here is I want to set my hot plate to 49 degree centigrade obviously it's going to start out at
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:08.800]   21.5 that's going to be the ambient room temperature that the probe is picking up and so then does take
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:15.280]   a while to heat up so I would say just let it heat up until you know that the oil is 49 degree centigrade
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:20.000]   and how you'll know that is 49 degrees is that you're going to add you're going to put the probe in
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.040]   place that's the heat probe that comes with the stir you put it into the holder and you slide it
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:31.120]   in now you want to set all of these at exactly the right place before you add the C60 let me just
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:36.160]   stop right there this is really important set the probe about one inch above the stir you don't
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:41.120]   want it to bump into the stir bar and you want to get that again you want to get it warm because
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:46.640]   if you add one I'm sorry once you add the C60 the entire solution turns black and you will not be
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.960]   able to see what's going on inside the beaker so you got to get all of this all of these things
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.960]   set you want to make sure the probe is set right you want to make sure the beakers centered you
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:00.160]   want to make sure that the the stir bar is spinning and then you go ahead and and then prepare your
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:07.600]   C60 so I got my little digital scale I'm going to basically weigh out 0.8 grams now this right here
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:14.000]   is a myron jar with O2 absorbers plus the little vial that I get the C60 in and this is how I store
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.640]   my C60 is inside of a airtight myron so there's no light and then no oxygen with the O2 absorbers
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:25.920]   and these little vials is how you get your C60 and so then basically I take the C60 and I'm going to
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:33.280]   measure out 0.8 grams because it's 0.8 grams of C60 per liter of oil so just basically
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:38.080]   tap it out really carefully and by all me sorry by all means you want to be really careful with
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.720]   this stuff it is so expensive I mean it's 120 grams that's more expensive than gold all right
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:48.000]   if you think about it so you know it's it's well maybe not anymore but it's definitely very expensive
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.520]   so you want to be really careful with it not spill it not have you don't want to make any
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:58.080]   mistakes right here basically here you go I got 0.8 on the digital scale and then what I want to do
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:04.400]   is pour the little bit leftover of the oil into my mortar and pestle and then I want to take the C60
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:10.000]   and carefully pick it up and not make any mistakes because you want to be very careful do not spill
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.760]   this stuff it's too expensive and then dump it in there okay once it's dumped in there I grab the
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:21.600]   pestle and I just start grinding away and I just grind for you know anywhere from 30 seconds to 60
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.960]   seconds until I turn it into like a silt and you want to just create this little slurry of liquefied
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:33.360]   C60 all grind it up and nice and pulverized and once you've got it all pulverized then basically
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:39.920]   it by that point in the process you're reading on your hot plate stir that it's 49 degrees centigrade
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:44.400]   you take out the probe because you know that it's spinning you know that it's heated up
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:50.720]   and then this is my process of getting all of the C60 off of the pestle and what I've learned over
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:56.960]   time is I just dunk it and if you just repeatedly dunk the pestle and then just kind of wipe it off
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:01.760]   I use a silicon spatula it works perfectly look how clean that is so you because you don't want any
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:09.600]   of the C60 you know remaining on the pestle or in the mortar so a silicon spatula works perfectly
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:16.080]   for getting all of that C60 the liquefied C60 out of the mortar off the pestle and into the oil now
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:21.600]   obviously you can see that when the moment I added it the solution just turns black you can't see
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:25.600]   what's going on anymore so you're you know that's why you have to do all that you know make sure
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.920]   all your settings are correctly on your stir before so then it turns black and then of course I've
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:34.880]   got the spatula and I want to do it my dunking method here to get all the oil off the spatula
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:40.560]   and that only takes just a few dunks and the next thing you know boom you've got all that C60 off
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:45.680]   of your spatula now the most important thing is once you've got it all added together you want to
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:54.400]   be looking at this you see this right here that's the dimple that is how you know that the entire
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:02.160]   beaker full of olive oil is spinning and not just the bottom part if you don't see a dimple that
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:07.440]   means the only the bottom is spinning and the very top is not because it's just not strong enough
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.600]   you don't have a big enough stir bar you don't have you don't have a spinning fast enough your
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.560]   oil is too thick or whatever but if you follow my formula then you're not you're going to see
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.760]   this dimple and that's very critical having that if you don't see that dimple you got problems so
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:25.840]   you want to see the dimple because the dimple is an indication that the whole thing is spinning
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:31.600]   because now it's black you can't tell so you got the dimple everything's added together it's heated
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:36.000]   up it's stirring you put some cling wrap on there you want to make it nice air tight you don't want
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.840]   anything to get in there you add the probe put the probe back into the beakers so that you can you
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.080]   can basically keep track of what the temperature is because by the way you know the hot plate stir
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:50.800]   works with the probe so whatever the probe says the hot plate will go up and down you know it'll heat
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:56.720]   up or or cool down just keep that at the temperature you set when you set the temperature on your hot
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:02.160]   plate it's controlled by the probe and then i just take a dish towel and i just wrap it up some people
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:08.080]   use a box other people keep it in a dark room i have this in my in my office so i just wrap it
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:13.200]   with a dark towel works fine keep it out of the dark and then you just kind of set it you don't
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:18.480]   have to worry about the heat he's not warm enough to you know catch anything on fire at 120 degrees
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:24.160]   and there you go it's completely all prepared and ready to go and you just let that thing sit for
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:28.560]   two weeks now it's going to just stir and you can hear it stirring too and then i of course i
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.360]   repeatedly ideally check it you know just to make sure the temperature is right um and it's still
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.840]   stirring you know you can hear it other than that again you can't see anything going on so you have
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:45.440]   to go by sound and they read out here so now after two weeks on the right side here is the button
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:51.760]   that turns off the stir so after two weeks you stop stirring and the way i do it is i leave the
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:58.160]   temperature on i just leave the the hot plate on so i want to keep it viscous i want to keep it heated
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:04.240]   up for the 10 day or the two week settling process but i definitely want it to stop stirring so that
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:09.360]   the oil stops moving and everything can start settling to the bottom so uh turn off the stir
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.840]   keep the hot plate running uh and just and off you go and so now i did get some new equipment for the
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.480]   filtration process uh and i just kind of want to show you so there's my my filter that i bought
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:23.440]   this is the apparatus that i purchased link in the video description uh below to all the equipment
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:28.560]   and then of course the new pump that i got and get all that settled that's what you're going to
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:33.840]   need is you're going to need the filter apparatus to pump and then the tube now the hose i know this
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:41.760]   is stupid guys but after all these years of trying to buy tubes and and hoses i mean you know i've
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:46.320]   been doing this for a long time i've tried silicon tubes i've tried rubber tubes i've tried all these
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:51.760]   different tubes and and you know hoses to connect the two things together and i stumbled upon this
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:59.360]   one time and it works perfectly and i'm going to show you here in a second but if you buy this aquarium
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:05.840]   siphon vacuum gravel cleaner you get the small one there's a bigger one and there's this little one
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:12.160]   you get the little one and the hose that it comes with is perfect for this it just that's just how
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.720]   it works out it's like seven bucks so that's the hose i use so now first thing you want to do is you
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:21.200]   want to get your pump it's going to need oil so you fill it up to the middle mat the middle line
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:26.720]   here between min and max you're going to need vacuum pump oil you need to prime your pump with oil
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.720]   make sure it's running it's a little engine next thing you know you want to get your filter paper
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:36.000]   now here's that uh paper that i was mentioning that needs to go in the apparatus this is the 0.22
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.320]   microns filter paper now of course the study used 0.25 which is close enough and then the diameter
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:46.400]   and the diameter is important i'll show you that in a second so you know you take your filter paper
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.840]   and you want to assemble your apparatus so the middle you take the middle section here and you
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:57.680]   stick it into the into the funnel or your flask and then you basically pop it on there and then
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:03.600]   you would want to then put your paper right above the middle section where it's going to actually
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.240]   there's going to be this funnel that's going to hold the oil and it's going to then at the very
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:13.600]   bottom of the funnel it'll be the paper and then it'll go into the actual flask itself so
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:19.600]   one thing about filter paper is that there's a shiny side and then there's a dull dull side to
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:24.880]   the paper and the rule of thumb is you always want to put the paper on your filter apparatus
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:30.960]   shiny side up and the reason for that is it's it's the it's uh it's just how those filters are made
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:38.880]   and you want it to be because you want it to be the the 0.22 micron in one direction just how it is
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:45.360]   so make sure you got your paper is shiny side up you center it onto the filter apparatus
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:50.400]   and one thing too about this if you can kind of tell um there you go you want to center it over
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:56.720]   the the middle part now this is the thing i bought a 50 milliliter ideally you'd want one to cover
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:02.880]   the whole things but they i couldn't find a 60 millimeter wide uh paper but 50 is good because
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:09.360]   the center center section here is crushed glass it's compressed crushed glass and that the oil will
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:14.720]   then go through that uh like basically it's like you know just a bunch of gravel uh and it'll go
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:19.120]   through that gravel and that's how it you know that's how it allows enough flow for it to be a
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:25.680]   filter so you want to basically get a piece of filter paper that has the correct diameter so be
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:31.360]   very careful about what apparatus you're using the dimensions of your apparatus uh like this one is
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:38.720]   60 millimeters or millimeters make sure your filter paper is going to fit over that so 50 millimeter
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:46.320]   filter papers fit over a 60 right as you can see others are 70 90 i mean you know they're all
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:51.280]   different sizes so make sure you get the right size not just the right filtration but the right
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.600]   size filter to go for your apparatus and then you put you see that on the very bottom you put
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:02.640]   the funnel on top of that you clamp the funnel onto your apparatus okay and there you go it's all
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:08.000]   assembled and of course there's a cover uh also keep dust and stuff out and then you're ready to go
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.120]   then your apparatus is set up okay so the next thing i would say is get your hoses out now and
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:18.080]   this is another little tip and trick that i've learned over years uh is get a cup of water get a
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:24.640]   couple of boiling hot water and that way you can to when you're gonna put your tubes onto your
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:30.000]   apparatus in your pump what i do is i soak the ends of the tube in that boiling water for about
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.520]   a minute just to make them super soft because don't even bother trying if you don't do this
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:40.400]   and then they just go on so much easier when they're soft so then you know again so just put it in
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:45.120]   boiling water for about a minute it'll soften up your hoses and you'll be able to connect your
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:50.880]   hoses way easier i mean you pretty much can even can you can't connect the hoses unless you do
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:56.240]   this okay so you know warm up your hoses uh you know and so that so you can connect them a lot
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:01.360]   easier and then they'll just slide right on very easily okay and there you go so now it's all
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:07.520]   connected and what i'm going to do is uh because this engine it's a little engine uh it does produce
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:13.360]   exhaust and you need good ventilation um it's kind of like summertime i don't want to open the windows
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:19.920]   so i took it out to the backyard and i set it up outside so now i've got my engine my little vacuum
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:25.120]   pump i got my fil my filtration apparatus and i'm gonna go ahead and add the oil now again this is
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:31.040]   right off the stir okay so i i've left the stir i heated up so this oil is at 49 degrees centigrade
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:36.320]   it's still warm you want to filter while it's warm uh again because it's more viscous and so you
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:42.480]   want to basically take your oil and you want to add it to your your vacuum apparatus now one thing i
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:49.600]   do want to say about the apparatus uh is that i went in uh this one here is a 500 milliliter apparatus
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:55.440]   now i'm filtering one liter of oil through it uh and so i just bought the 500 milliliter you can buy
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:01.680]   a 1000 milliliter or one liter filter apparatus they're just more expensive and you have to buy
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:06.000]   bigger filter papers uh and so it's just more expensive to go with the big one and if you're
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.280]   only going to be filtering one liter then i just run it through this smaller one you know it's a
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:17.840]   smaller filter apparatus meaning that it's 500 milliliter apparatus with a 300 milliliter funnel
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:23.840]   okay so that means that you only can add 300 milliliters at a time to use the filter and then
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:29.120]   you have to change the paper but you know and but what that means is if i want to do a full leader
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:34.880]   at 300 milliliters at a time i do 300 milliliters i do another 300 milliliters and then i just do
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:40.480]   400 milliliters at the end and then i use three pieces of a filter paper and i'm done and it's
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.680]   half it's literally about 70 to 60 percent cheaper if i would have bought the bigger one because you
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:49.280]   know you know you don't you don't i'm just saying you just don't need to spend that money if you
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:54.880]   don't want to so i just use a 500 milliliter filter okay so then i add the oil to the funnel i fill
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:02.480]   it up to 300 milliliters or roughly thereabouts and then um off i go okay so then basically at that
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:08.720]   point i've turned the filter on it's running or the pump is running and then all of a sudden it
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:13.280]   creates a vacuum in the bottom section of the filter apparatus and it starts sucking the oil
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:18.560]   through the paper into the flask on the bottom okay and there you go and so you can kind of just
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:23.200]   see it now what's really cool about this is right off the bat you know as this thing filters
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:29.280]   you can start to see the C60 oil and any C60 olive oil product is going to look like this
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:34.000]   it changes from green to red and that's what's one of the coolest things about you know if you
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.360]   didn't filter it your all of your C60 olive oil would kind of stay black but if you filter it it
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:43.520]   turns red and it's just kind of a really pretty color and this just means hey you've done it right
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.080]   it's the right color that's coming out the way it's supposed to come out and so there you go so
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:54.000]   it starts filtering i did time this uh and what happened was it was based on the equipment that
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:01.360]   i'm using i'm using a 3.5 cubic feet per minute vacuum pump with a 500 milliliter apparatus and
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:08.480]   i discovered and timed it multiple times and it always averaged out to be uh one minute 20 seconds
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:14.240]   per 50 milliliters or in other words to do the entire leader using these this equipment takes
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:19.600]   about 27 minutes total okay so for 27 minutes that's how long it's going to take if you decide to go
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:25.920]   the cheaper out and get those little aquarium pumps then it's going to take a whole day or two days
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:31.120]   that's how you know getting the right equipment saves you a lot of time and trouble so there you go
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:35.840]   so then i just set up the second batch of the second you know 300 and then i run that and then
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:41.040]   i'm doing the this is the third batch and what i want to point out right now is i've added the
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:47.840]   third batch right so it's 300 at a time i did 300 batch one 300 batch two and i did 400 batch
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:54.560]   three okay and so the 400 milliliters is the last amount of C60 to be filtered and then this is
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.520]   what the flat the beaker looks like when you're done and all of this black right here is is your
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:05.760]   residual C60 that's settled out of the oil okay that's why you want to settle it out you let it
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:10.800]   wait for two weeks and it'll all kind of go to the bottom and and this is what you get left over so
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:16.880]   even though i added 0.8 milligrams per liter what the actual end product that you're going to get
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:22.480]   in a diy environment i would guess and it's a huge guess i've been trying to there's no way to really
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:30.160]   know for sure exactly how much is left over because you can't measure that easily and so what's left
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:34.800]   over i would say is probably about point uh like you know if you're going by milliliters per so like
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:42.800]   0.8 milliliters you're probably looking at a 0.05 or 0.5 you know 0.5 not even i wouldn't even
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:48.640]   say it's a 0.1 milliliter i would say it's like a 0.05 milliliters of residual C60 so there will be
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:54.960]   C60 left over in the beaker but don't don't let it go to waste you can just add more oil and run
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:59.760]   your second batch okay but there will be some left over in your beaker when you're done and that's
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:04.080]   what it's going to look like but don't throw it away and don't wash that beaker but there you go
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:09.600]   you've got about 0.05 milliliters or milligrams of C60 in there and you definitely don't want to
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:14.400]   throw it away so now here's what the paper looks like after running it all the oil through it
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:19.040]   there's the first two here are brown and the last one's black let me explain that the brown is this
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:23.760]   is totally normal this is what they always look like they always look brown like this so basically
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:29.920]   i filtered i filtered this is 300 milliliters of filtered out 300 milliliters filtered out and 400
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:33.920]   and the reason this one's black is because as you get to the bottom you get closer to that residual
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:40.080]   C60 and some of that gets poured off into the into the funnel and so you'll start trapping
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.560]   some residual C60 that way you kind of got to be a little careful with it you don't want to
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:49.680]   pour the whole thingy into the funnel because that way you you know it's just going to get wasted
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.600]   on the paper you don't want to throw it away but basically this is what you filter out and this
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:58.640]   is what you're not drinking and you know this is not you know this is what's not going to go through
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:04.080]   your kidneys if that's important to you but this is the filters and this is what got you know caught
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:09.840]   by the filters through the process and which is now removed from the oil and you've got pristine
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:16.240]   C60 oil now what I do is I do store my C60 oil in an infinity jar also called myron jar
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:21.760]   now these jars are very special jars they they basically block any type of UV light
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:27.760]   and they're airtight so I store all my oils that I make in these infinity jars and what doesn't fit
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:33.520]   in the jar I keep in a mason jar in a cabinet and I keep it you know keep it dark and then I just
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:37.520]   kind of eat off I just kind of you know eat off of this one and pour this into my daily
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:44.160]   protein shake and that's kind of how I do it and so store in something that's airtight and
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:50.160]   and you know in a dark place and you know I recommend these myron jars because they prevent any light
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:55.920]   getting to your C60 oil light is an issue and then basically here's your beaker again now your
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:00.800]   beakers got that C60 on the bottom and you don't want to waste it and so I would just this is
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:07.280]   exactly what I do I just add I just add more oil to this I add more C60 to it throw it back on the
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:12.160]   spinner and make the next batch and that way you don't waste anything and that's it that's how
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:18.320]   you make C60 oil so anyway hey thanks for watching that was as straightforward as it gets that's how
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:23.120]   I do it that's the everything I've learned in the last seven years on how to make the best batch
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.600]   I could make if you do have any questions you know come on join our C60 chat group link below

[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:47.920]   content and you want more information about C60 I have a huge section of my blog at the Tinkers
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:53.280]   Academy blog on C60 and it's just got tons of information and playlists of all the different
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:58.480]   videos that I've made if you want to learn more about C60 however this is the tutorial I hope
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.960]   this was helpful and educational and if you like this type of content I'd really appreciate if you
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:09.120]   would like and subscribe I do C60 videos every now and then not as much as before but I still do
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:13.280]   them I still you know I still like to tinker around with it quite a bit and obviously I make it all
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:18.000]   the time and take it every day so thanks for watching really appreciate your time I know it's
