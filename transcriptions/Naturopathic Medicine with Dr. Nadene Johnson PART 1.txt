[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and in this video, I would like to share with you
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.640]   a great discussion I just had with Dr. Nadine Johnson, who is a doctor of
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.000]   naturopathic medicine practicing in the state of Illinois here in the USA.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.940]   She holds a doctorate in naturopathic medicine from the National University of Health Science.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.440]   She's also board-certified as a naturopathic physician in the state of Illinois, and also holds a master of
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.820]   science and acupuncture and a license to practice acupuncturists, or is a licensed
[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.400]   acupuncturist, also in the state of Illinois. And we had the most fascinating discussion about
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.560]   what is naturopathic medicine? You know, how does it work? What's it all about?
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:58.400]   You know, how would you, you know, go ahead and and give it a try if you've never tried naturopathic medicine before, and what to expect, and all of that.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.800]   And that's covered all in part one here. Now there's going to be a part two that goes off into another
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.400]   great series of topics that we chatted about, but I just wanted to kind of share with you a little bit about Nadine and just this
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.720]   wonderful human being who's made it her life's goal to help and help others, you know with their health and their
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.640]   wellness and and this discussion is part one is a
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:29.760]   great place to start if you're new to naturopathic medicine, and then to also hear some of these remarkable healing stories of
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.240]   some of the people that she's helped with on their healing journey. So, you know, so go ahead and let's go ahead and start the interview right now, and
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.440]   thanks for joining.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.160]   Hello everyone, and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host, Kay Almer, and I have got the incredible privilege and just
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.440]   wonderful opportunity to interview Dr. Nadine Johnson, who is a doctor of natural path, or
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:04.480]   what I'm sorry, doctor of I'm so I didn't mean to butcher that, but natural pathic doctor, but how do you like describe your doctor of
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.520]   what's the phrase for that? Yeah, natural pathic medicine. Natural pathic medicine, and I just, you know, thank you for joining me.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.360]   Nadine's been a longtime member of our telegram chat group and a great contributor in terms of just when people have questions about, you know,
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.560]   I mean, you know, stuff that I can't even answer. I haven't done the research, but, you know, more so it's better to ask her and
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.040]   some of our other healers, and I just want to say thank you for joining me, and
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.120]   I'm taking this opportunity to learn about
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.360]   naturopathic medicine, and got my newbie at this. I'm learning each different segment, you know,
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.560]   I'm good at some and kind of a complete newbie at others, and just like kind of like what's your journey, and what is this all about?
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:56.680]   So I guess the first thing I'd like to do is just say, you know, welcome, Aloha, and thanks for joining me, and, you know, could you kind of explain,
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.560]   you know, like, you know, like, just overall general, what is naturopathic medicine?
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.040]   To someone who's just like, you know, that doesn't have a clue what that is.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.600]   Okay, yeah, so thank you so much, Kay, for this opportunity to talk to you. I really appreciate it.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.880]   So naturopathic medicine is really just
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.480]   medicine without drugs or surgery. That's the basic thing.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:35.880]   If you think of the medical profession and doctors along a continuum, you know, at the far, far one in, there's medical
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.360]   drug and medical doctors, then in the middle, there's kind of functional medical doctors,
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:53.320]   and then the far other end is naturopathic. And we are trained, I was trained in medical school, so I actually have the same training as a naturo,
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:03.720]   an NP or a physician's assistant or a nurse practitioner, but we get training in nutrition,
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:12.360]   homeopathy, physical therapy, all kinds of supplements, diet, and we get trained in
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:21.080]   all kinds of physical medicine. So all the modalities that we use are all natural,
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.880]   even though we may use a lot of supplements that maybe aren't, you know, you can't go out and find them,
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.080]   you know, in the ground, but compared to using drugs and surgery, they are natural.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:44.760]   So we can take, you know, a person who comes in with any kind of thing, usually they're
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.240]   really complicated and look at it and look at the body holistically. So we'll look at things
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:58.360]   with all the systems that are connected, whereas in allopathy, they, you know, it's always one
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.520]   system at a time. If you've got a heart problem and go to the cardiologist, if you've got a
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.280]   joint problem, you go to, you know, the joint doctor, you know, if you've got an endocrine
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.520]   problem, it's an endocrinologist, but we look at things holistically, I look at, well, so how's this
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:22.360]   endocrine issue affecting the joints? Because it is. How is this affected by their diet? How's
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:29.000]   their gut affecting, you know, their endocrine system? Because it is. Everything is connected. So
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.640]   we take like a really big vision and narrow it down to that one person
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:44.360]   and work through, you know, different methods that are very gentle to accomplish,
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.800]   really, you know, a total health. Does that kind of make sense?
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.080]   Yeah, that doesn't make sense. I mean, okay, so allopascis for folks that aren't familiar with
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:03.800]   the term is a standard American medical association, certified physician that you would find in a
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.520]   hospital or a medical practice, usually your GP, right? A general practitioner. And then, of course,
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.280]   that's the one those are the people that are tied to the health insurance system.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.680]   And that is what is considered modern medical health care. But I think you bring up a really good
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:28.600]   point though, is, you know, first of all, a human being is an entirely, you know, complex system of
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.040]   different things going on. And you're right, you know, you just, it's not one thing. It's like,
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.440]   if you ever had to debug, debug any, I'm from a technology background, you know, whenever I had
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.160]   the debug technology, it was never what you thought it was. It was always because everything's connected
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.720]   and they're all talking to each other. So I'm sure, you know, certainly the body's the same way. But
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.800]   my point though is that the things you listed out, you know, understanding nutrition and diet and
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.680]   all of these other aspects of a person's health in addition, in terms of trying to,
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.360]   I guess, evaluate their health or their condition, right? Is I know that I know for a fact that
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:12.040]   allopaths come out of medical school with almost no education. I think they're nutrition if they
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:18.120]   they go to school for eight years on average, right? And how much of those eight years is spent
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:25.160]   understanding nutrition? Not even a few hours. Yeah, or the bioelectrics, you know, the concept of a
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.000]   biolectric. Oh, none. Right. None. Right. So they don't take classes in that. They take, I don't know.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.440]   No, they get no education and vaccines either. Yeah. So you look at the whole person then. So,
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:46.040]   so like, I was kind of reading your website and understand that. So you're an actual board
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.200]   certified in your state, right? So you're actually not not only doctor from education, but I guess
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:59.400]   there's like 21 states in the country that certify natural paths. And so in some states that they
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.920]   may not necessarily be, quote, licensed, but you've actually gone the full route and you've got a
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:11.720]   practice and you're practicing in Illinois, is that correct? Yes, that's correct. So, so the tricky
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:19.320]   thing about the term naturopath is that there are two sections of naturopath. There's
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:25.560]   naturopathic physicians who are trained in a medical school and have gone through years of
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:32.760]   clinical work like I have, and they are licensable in a state that licenses those type of physicians.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:39.640]   And then there are traditional naturopaths who have not gone to medical school, but they still have
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.440]   good, you know, they still might have good training. It just may be online classes. It may be in-person
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:52.440]   classes, but it's not medical training. So it's a little confusing because you can be a natural
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:58.440]   path and not have gone through medical school. Okay. So like, so on your FAQ here, you kind of
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:04.360]   got there's a difference between a naturopathic doctor and a natural path. Okay. So when people
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.960]   are seeking out, let's say, you know, the majority of Americans are probably fed up with the health
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:15.640]   care system. I don't think anybody doesn't know that it's broken. Try to go get an appointment,
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.800]   try to get some help, you get five minutes with somebody, and they walk in, ask you three questions,
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:27.800]   give you drugs and walk away. So, you know, it's common sense that it's this, and then this whole
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.840]   concept of, okay, take these and if you're not better, come back the next week. Yes, you know,
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.080]   that's like, there's a joke, right? That's quite, quote, they call it a practice.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:44.280]   They're experimenting on you. Yeah, try this and if it doesn't work. I mean, you know, it's like,
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:50.600]   hey, can you imagine taking your car in and they'll go, okay, try this, give me some money and see
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.160]   if this works. Sure. If the car doesn't work next week, bring it back. Oh, car doesn't work again
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:01.400]   next week. Give me some more money. Try this and, you know, would you put how many times would you go
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.120]   back to the car repair shop before you start wondering, maybe you need another mechanic.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:12.600]   And so, okay, so I'm really curious. So, like, I was looking here at your credentials, like,
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.440]   so what does it take? I mean, yeah, because you mentioned you had that you're at the same level
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.960]   of a PA, so that, so there's a lot of academics, so there's a bachelor's, the master's, and then you
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.520]   had to go to a separate school. Is that how that works? Yes. Because I see you got a master's of
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:33.560]   science and acupuncture as well. And so, is acupuncture required to be a naturopath? Or is that an extra
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:40.040]   thing that you added on to your credentials? So, that's, so that's, that's an extra thing that I
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:48.520]   added on. Okay. Some states, I don't know, I don't think anybody requires it, but it, it dovetails
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:57.000]   really well with naturopathic medicine. So, a lot of us do have acupuncture degrees, and we use that
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:06.840]   under our naturopathic doctor licensure. Okay. Because I'm not licensed as an actual physician
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:14.200]   in Illinois, I rely a little bit more on my acupuncture license. Okay. Okay. And so, and, and
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:20.600]   is that kind of, and so, you know, there's also doctors of chiropractic medicine and homeopathy,
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:26.280]   but I'm thinking homeopathy is not necessarily like a licensed thing. Is that, okay, and then
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:32.760]   chiropractic is, so that's another branch of, quote, healthcare, right, is chiropractic
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:39.320]   homeopathy. Okay. I'm sorry, naturopath. All right. So, yeah, it seems like there's, there's a lot
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.640]   of study in it, and how many years have you been in, in, in doing this line of work?
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:52.840]   Jeez. Well, since I graduated from school, it's been five years, but it was, I was like seven years
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:12:01.240]   in school. So, yeah, medical school is no joke. Yeah, I might, well, yeah, I guess I mentioned
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.600]   on my videos and stuff, my daughter's currently attending vet school. Oh, you know, and so she's,
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:12.680]   she's, I'm just so proud of her. I love to brag, but she's currently going to Mizzou
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:18.280]   as in a grad program there. And, you know, and it's funny that, you know, I'm, I'm kind of like
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:24.600]   anti-allopath, but here's my daughters and allopath for animals. But, you know, but, but she gets it.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:30.040]   And then art, our running thing is that once she graduates and gets her, you know, whatever she's
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.920]   gonna do, we're definitely, she wants to open up a practice. And I said, well, give me, I said,
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.560]   give me a room in that, in that practice where I can then I'll be your, now be your
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:45.160]   alternative healing pet healing for pets, right? Because they've got acupuncture for pets. They've
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.480]   got all sorts of stuff. And I, I'm like, hey, I'll bring in the cold lasers. I'll bring in the,
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.880]   you know, the, you know, multi-wave oscillators. I'll come in with the seniors, you know, because
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:59.320]   I've actually treated my pets with those types of devices with great success. And she's like,
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:05.640]   yeah, I'll give you a room, dad, and you can be the office manager. Love it. You know, so yeah,
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.200]   absolutely. So she gets it. And she's, she's really, you know, in, you know, Hawaiian word is,
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:15.880]   there's a word called Akamai, which means you're, you know, you get it, right? She's really Akamai
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.720]   about that. But, you know, a couple of other interesting questions that I have, because I've
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:26.040]   never spoke before, you know, to a doctor of naturopathic medicine. But so, okay, so there's a lot
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:31.800]   of education, you're licensed in your state. And then so, but are you part of the insurance world?
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.880]   Because in the past, you know, like, I got, I guess I know many, many, many years ago,
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:43.000]   I just was fed up with having back problems my whole life. And I'd gone to
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.360]   chiropractics and I've gone to orthopedics and so forth. And at one point, I wanted to go to,
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:55.080]   I just wanted to try it. And this is how I was introduced to traditional Chinese medicine.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:01.800]   And so, so I went to an acupuncturist in Honolulu. And then my insurance wouldn't cover it. I mean,
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:07.560]   so is that, is that a common problem for, for folks? I mean, is that like, when people have
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:12.040]   health insurance, can they go to you or, or it's it going to be out of pocket? Because I know sometimes
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.720]   chiropractics, you, you can cover. So how does that work? You know, in terms of health insurance
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:26.840]   and your, your profession? Yes, yes. So that's a no thing. So I have one toe in the insurance world,
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:36.600]   and it is a painful one. I can accept, accept, accept insurance for, for acupuncture with some plans.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:43.240]   And they pay pretty well if they cover acupuncture. They don't cover
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:52.040]   naturopathic medicine, because it's not licensable in the state. So I get a lot of people who ask me,
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:57.560]   you know, does naturopathic medicine is that covered by insurance? And I have to say no,
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:04.760]   and thank goodness, because if it was, they would try to tell me how to what to do.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:13.000]   Yeah. They would try to control the care. Now, in other states, where a naturopathic doctor is
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:21.240]   licensed, it often is covered by insurance. And I don't think there's really an issue with care,
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:26.520]   but you know, I'm a little bit absent and stubborn. And I want to do. Yeah, really.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:33.800]   And so I want to do what I want to do. And, you know, if I think somebody needs this particular
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:39.720]   care, you know, then that's what I'm going to prescribe for them. So, and I don't want anybody
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.160]   to tell me, no, you can't do that, or no, I'm not going to pay for it. So,
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:49.960]   so that's, so that's a really nice thing. So it's a hit or miss, right? Yeah. And people
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:56.440]   where you live. Yeah. And people, people don't under, you know, they, they don't like having to pay
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:03.480]   for their health care, or they're just not used to it. So it just depends on what state you're in,
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:10.440]   whether it may be covered by insurance or not. But it's not here in Illinois from naturopathic
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:17.160]   care, but it is for acupuncture. Oh, yeah, that's, you know, it's, it's, yeah, I don't want to go
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:25.000]   off on a tangent about how health care insurance is such a huge scam thing. But okay, I was just
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.360]   wondering, because I know that, you know, it's, it's problematic, right, for people,
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.800]   because of the expense. And I had to pay out of pocket. And I love this one question here on your
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:40.440]   FAQ about does acupuncture hurt? I've done it a lot. And I could tell you, you don't even feel it.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.120]   It's just the strangest thing for someone to put little needles in you. And you don't, you don't
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.040]   even feel it. You were watching them do it. And you don't, you don't feel what they're doing. It's
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:53.880]   just really strange. I know. But yeah, I'm sure you get that. But people want to know they think,
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:17:00.680]   they think you're putting a big hypodermic needle into your body. You know, no. It was teeny tiny.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:07.000]   Yeah, yeah, it is. It's really, really, really, really small. So okay, so now that we kind of got,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.960]   you know, got that intro behind us, I just would, I'd like to understand the methodology. You know,
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.600]   I mean, you've kind of described it in general, in terms of looking at the, at the body as a whole
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:22.760]   living system, and everything's interconnected. So you evaluate the whole thing. But my, my first
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:29.800]   question is, I'm really such a nerd about how things work. But like, like, can we just start out,
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:36.280]   like, how do you diagnose, you know, because my experience with an acupuncturist, which,
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:41.640]   you know, was, was they just would look at, I mean, they had, there was this, this Chinese lady,
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:47.720]   and, and very respected, you know, in Honolulu, she was actually the dean of Chinese medicine at
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:53.160]   University of Hawaii. I don't know how I lucked out, but I ended up with her. And, and we got along
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.000]   great, because I was always asking tons of questions, I was so interested in what was going on. And
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.360]   she actually invited me to sit in and I did audit some classes, because I was so interested in what
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:07.800]   was going on. But she would basically, the whole tongue thing, you know, like stick your tongue
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:13.080]   up, you know, like, she would look at my, and she would talk about me in terms of like, heat and
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:18.200]   cold and, and dry and wet. And, you know, and I didn't really understand what she was talking
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:25.080]   about. But she did some amazing things to, to my body that helped me so many different ways. It was
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:31.080]   just unbelievable, which is what really sold me on. Hey, there is another way to seek out health
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:37.160]   care. And, but I think the thing was was, I don't know, like, are you guys like gifted, like, with a
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:42.120]   touch? Because she could touch me, and then start telling me about myself. Like, she, you know,
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:46.760]   touch the wrists and the neck. And, and that was so it's just like, how do you, is that, you know,
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:52.440]   like, what's that part about your, your diagnosis? Because I know if you go to a medical doctor,
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.640]   they're just going to quote run tests. And it's going to be like, jing, jing, jing, jing, jing,
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.080]   you know, and I always look at it like it's their cash cow. This is how they're getting, you know,
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:05.400]   it's like, like going to like, again, take your card and mechanic and I got to do this test and
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:11.320]   this test and this test is going to cost you, you know, 40, 30 bucks each. But you know, so, but
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.400]   that doesn't happen, right? When you, when you work with someone like yourself. So like, how is
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:20.120]   that diagnosis? Like, if you kind of describe, like, what do you do, you know, how do you find
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:28.040]   out what's wrong with someone? So are you talking mostly about Chinese medicine diagnosis versus,
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.920]   how about, how about this? Like, if you, if like, like myself, I've never actually consulted a
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:40.120]   naturopath. I've only done Chinese traditional medicine. And in terms of something that's an
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:44.840]   alternative. And of course, all the stuff that I do myself, I've never actually worked with
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:50.760]   anybody that does bioelectric, I know chiropractors build it into their, you know, practices like PMF
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.720]   and things like that. So I've done all that myself, did all the research, and I'm a big huge DIY guy.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:03.560]   And the only time I've reached out, outside of alopas is with, with Chinese. But, and I was
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:10.920]   really just amazed at how she diagnosed me. So, and so I'm just kind of wondering, like, in the world
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.720]   of somebody comes to you, you know, because like, I'm a total noob at this. So if I come to you and
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:23.720]   say, look, pick a problem, you know, like, constipation, let's pick that up. And what, where do you
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:28.520]   start? Or like, Oh, kidney stones, I just had a kidney stone and that's a good one too, right?
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.160]   Or I can't sleep, you know, any of those kinds of issues, I guess they're all individually different,
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:39.080]   but like, what's what's the general approach? I'm trying to understand, like, what do you start with,
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:47.960]   and then how do you do it? So that's a great question. So technically, because I'm not licensed,
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:55.960]   I can't actually diagnose somebody with, you know, say an ACD, you know, 10 code or whatever it is.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:02.760]   Not ICD 10, but, you know, I technically can't make a diagnosis, but I take what people bring
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.720]   in, like, they'll come in and they'll say, well, the doctor says I've got this, like, oh, okay.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:15.160]   First, I will do an extremely detailed health history. I'll look at labs, although labs are not
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:23.480]   the most important thing to me, they're just like numbers. I ask a ton of questions, and I'm really,
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:31.160]   really good at listening, and plus, I'm really good at critical thinking and using my intuition
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:41.000]   to make connections that people don't realize. I have had things come up. I mean, it's just
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:49.960]   amazing. I really rely, I know this sounds kind of woo-woo, but I rely on my intuition with the
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:57.080]   universe to leave me where this particular patient needs to go, and it's never failed me yet,
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:05.240]   ever. And then, and I will always do a physical exam because, yes, touching a person, no matter
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:12.360]   what, because I've been a massage therapist for 16 or 17 years, I have intuition in my fingers,
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:19.560]   and I absolutely rely on that as well. It tells me things on a level that I don't even know.
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:27.960]   So, I know that sounds kind of out of the box, and woo-woo, but it actually works really,
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:35.080]   really well in practice, and things just come out, and I will pick up on something
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:44.200]   and let, let my intuition guide me with the questions. And typically, what I will look for
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:50.920]   is something where they have been never well since. You know, it's like, you know what,
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:58.600]   maybe an accident, it might be a trauma, it might be a childhood thing, but if I can find that,
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:07.240]   then that will inform treatment. You know, that will make a difference because we might focus on,
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:12.120]   oh, it might be something in the brain, it might be a PTSD thing. We might need to do
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:17.480]   primitive reflex exercises, you know, maybe they were traumatized as a baby.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:25.240]   So, it's just this wide open thing that, you know, I get scared when people come in,
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:30.040]   really, because I'm like, can I do it? What if I can't do it this time? You know, what if,
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:37.000]   what if I can't figure it out? But every time something leads me down a rabbit hole with that
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:44.120]   particular person. And it's just kind of like magic. So I pull together all the medical knowledge
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:50.920]   that I've got. All right, so sorry about that little interruption. You're right in the middle of
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:56.600]   explaining your diagnoses project process, and you're like, it's magic. And I think that's
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.640]   where we got cut off. Yeah, I was going to ask, yeah, you know, I was going to ask you those,
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.440]   like, because that's exactly what other people are, you know, because I'm really starting this,
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.880]   really focused on health and healing on the YouTube channel and blog. And, you know, as I speak to
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:16.360]   more and more healers, and I really want to keep doing this, because you folks are such amazing
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:22.520]   beings, it's the same. It's the same with so far, I've only done, you know, three interviews
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:28.120]   of other healers. And it's all the same. All of you are saying almost the same thing. And I think
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:34.360]   that's where the quantum aspect comes in, you know, this intuitive, you know, like when your bio
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:39.880]   fields combine, right, your bio fields connect with each other. We're all connected in the quantum
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:44.840]   field. But when you actually, you know, when your bio fields are in met, you know, immersed
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:49.560]   with each other is when the communication really starts happening and your intuition kicks off,
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:54.280]   and an intuition is definitely a gift. So it sounds like, you know, that's, that's kind of
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:25:00.680]   part of the process that you actually do have a gift. Yeah, it definitely is a big part of it.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.640]   And it did take me a while, number one, to realize that and number two to actually
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:14.760]   use it and then to actually rely on it. And I now tell my patients upfront that I don't know
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:21.160]   everything. And so I asked the universe to bring in exactly what you need for a treatment.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:27.880]   And it's never failed me. And they usually understand that because it's a form of prayer.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.440]   So do people, do people seek you out after they've kind of like, I guess, had a negative experience
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:41.880]   or failed experience with their traditional doctors? Or are they, I mean, how many, like,
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.440]   what would be the percent of people who come to you straight off the bat, you know, with an issue
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.760]   as opposed to people who are just like, they can't get help. They just can't get what they need.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:56.440]   And they're like seeking something and alternative anything, you know, because they're so frustrated
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:02.120]   or desperate. I mean, what's that percentage? The majority, the majority are the ones who are
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:09.640]   desperate and have been through the medical mill, and they can't find answers, or it's getting worse,
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:15.160]   or they're just at the end of their rope. There are a few, I'd probably say maybe
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:23.080]   a third who are natural, who've always been natural, but who just need more guidance.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:31.560]   But the vast majority have been through, you know, or they've had an epiphany like you and said,
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:36.440]   I'm done with that system. I need more help, you know, in a natural way.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:43.320]   Yeah, yeah, I can see that. I think that's a lot of it too. And I moderate different channels
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:48.840]   on Telegram, and they're all related to health one way or another. And it seems that the majority
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:53.080]   of people coming into those different chat groups or, you know, the different things are,
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.960]   they've kind of like seen the light, you know, like, I'm not going to get any help from these
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.200]   people. I need, you know, like other isn't there, you know, is there an alternative?
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:07.720]   And they're doing their own research. And so, yeah, I think I definitely see that. So,
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:13.000]   okay, so from a diagonal, because I just like, I'm just, I'm really curious about the diagnosis
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.720]   aspect. So thank you for explaining that. It does make a lot of sense to me, because, you know,
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:23.480]   what I've also been doing, you know, I think in one of my recent videos, I did a deep dive on
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:31.000]   meridian stress assessments, also known as bioranogenic diagnoses, right? And I found that to be quite
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:39.400]   fascinating because there's actually devices that can, can, you know, do diagnoses that are based on
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:45.960]   the actual Chinese traditional medicine, you know, the flow of meridians, you know, so they, you know,
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:51.960]   it's kind of interesting how Western doctors have adopted the concepts and practices of Chinese
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:57.160]   traditional medicine. And they've created devices to do with people like yourself can do naturally.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:03.800]   Right. Right. So, actually, I've always been interested in that particular one, the EAV.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:11.560]   Yeah. Elic, Elic throws something something according to vol. I've just never settled on the machine.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:17.800]   Yeah. Well, the actual, yeah, going off on a tangent, there's actually a deck, a deck of vol.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:25.000]   Yeah, that was, yeah, I was doing one on the device that the BESA Institute uses and they have,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.680]   they actually had their own created, they have their own proprietary machine that they use.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.400]   There's other ones out there. I think there's another one called Bioscan. But yeah, these are
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:41.880]   kind of like quantum devices where they just tap into you and then using a, I guess, you know,
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:47.080]   just using electrical current trying and measuring the changes of the current through your meridians
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:53.560]   can determine positive, negative, or neutral health. And then, of course, depending on what
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:58.760]   meridian you're looking at, then tells them what the, you know, what, where in the body the issues are.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.960]   And that's another approach. And I know that our good friend, Mandy,
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:09.000]   can't go this interview without just mentioning her, the lovely being, this beautiful soul on our
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.680]   planet. She's, she and I are really into the, you know, the tenant biomodulator, the, you know,
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.520]   Jerry, Jerry Tenant stuff. And her and I swap, you know, we're like swapping education materials
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.080]   because I got my whole setup and then she got her whole setup. And so we're kind of like trading
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.320]   materials. And she went to the conference, I think, and yeah, she didn't. And then she shared
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.320]   her stuff with me. And it's just, so that's another way to do it as well. It's measuring the body
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:39.240]   voltage. And I think Dr. Jerry Tenant has himself immersed himself deeply into the
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:43.880]   concepts of Chinese traditional medicine and using all of those concepts have kind of took
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:49.560]   off and created his whole healing, his voltage, you know, you know, concepts and things like that
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:55.160]   philosophy. So yeah, that's that's fascinating. It all ties together, right? Yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:01.880]   Body is much more than just one thing at a time. It's an entire living breathing system.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:08.440]   So now for people who have, have, let's say, never been to a naturopathic doctor,
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:14.760]   they go in, they get basically interviewed. I'm, do you encourage them, hey, bring in whatever
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:18.760]   you've got your lab tests, your extraction, you know, just, you know, it's just a tiny part of it,
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.560]   but you know, do you tell them to bring it in if they have it? Because I'm sure you probably get
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.400]   cancer patients who are kind of at their wit's end, right? And they probably all these numbers and
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:32.840]   reports and things like that. So, so do you, so you said that it's a little bit of what you do,
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:37.480]   it's not necessary, but do you ask, ask people to bring it in and just bring in whatever you got,
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.800]   or is that, or do you like to start from scratch? And you don't want to, you want to kind of just
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:46.040]   take it from, you know, just start from scratch and take it from there.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:52.520]   No, I like them to bring in the labs that they've got, the imaging that they've got,
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:59.160]   because I look at it a little more functionally than their doctor would. And I can almost always
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:06.440]   pick out things that their doctor is not addressing, didn't notice, or isn't concerned about. And
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:13.960]   you know, I'll often have people bring in imaging, like their MRI results, or x-ray results, and
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:20.760]   I can translate it for them from the doctor's, you know, and explain to them what's going on in
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:26.440]   their body, and what their doctor meant, and what it actually means, you know, with the imaging.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:32.840]   And that's a huge thing, because people, you know, because the doctors don't explain,
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:39.320]   they don't take the time to talk about what's going on in your body, how could this have happened,
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:45.240]   and, you know, what might it be related to, and what does, what do those terms and that whole,
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:52.680]   you know, scenario there that's on that paper, what does that actually mean? And so that's a big
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:57.240]   relief and a comfort to people that I can kind of explain to them what's going on.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:06.200]   So I just kind of offer a different bird's eye view, you know, than the medical profession
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:12.680]   might do. I just take way more time, I take way more energy, I actually listen to the people,
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:18.120]   and I'll talk to them, you know, on their level and say, you know, this is what's going on. If
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:24.360]   I have to pull out my anatomy books and show them, I will. It makes a huge difference.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.560]   Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah, it's that man, that is literally a 180 degree difference from
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:35.880]   all the experiences I've had. I usually, you know, like in when I used to go to Alipass,
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:44.360]   I think maybe five minutes, maybe I think the longest I ever spent with anybody was maybe 10 minutes,
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:50.520]   and they basically, you know, it was just I didn't get any very little information,
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.320]   and, you know, a prescription, and here you go, kind of thing, come back later.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:02.920]   So yeah, I think that's definitely makes so much sense to me. So let's just kind of from just an
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:10.280]   example for people who are maybe considering, you know, reaching out to a naturopath doctor.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:16.920]   First thing is, is how do they find one? Because that was one of the big questions I would,
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:22.040]   I've been give asked because people who kind of watch some of the electoral healing videos
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:27.000]   that I make with all these credible, you know, these crazy devices, but then like, okay, well,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.480]   if I can't afford to buy my own, you know, we're going to multi-wave oscillator, you know,
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.400]   seniors are not cheap. You know, where can I go and try it? Because that's what I always tell
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.720]   people right now for, you know, just I'm just, I'm more of an advice guy, education guy. But,
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:44.360]   you know, when people like, hey, I want to, I want to try using that device you just demonstrated.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.960]   I don't want to try that on, you know, I got a bad knee or something like so, but I can't afford,
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:51.880]   I don't want to buy the thing. I just want to try it. So, you know, so I'm like, well,
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:58.520]   that's a good question. Because then how do you find people who are using rife machines, right,
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.760]   in their practices and things like that? Or how do you find someone who's got a Likovsky or,
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:07.160]   or whatever, right, or violet rays and all these different really incredible electrical devices.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:13.160]   So that's been a challenge, I think, for, for bioelectric magnetics, you know, teaching people how
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:19.960]   to use that for health. But in your world, how do you find a natural path, you know, a doctor at
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:25.960]   your level? And where would they go? Is it something as simple as keep Googling until you get lucky or
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:31.640]   because, yeah, Google is not necessarily friendly now to anyone who's not a
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:39.640]   elephant in terms of finding information. I see that and I'm going to have to address that
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:46.280]   eventually. You can't actually find me by Googling it because I'm at the top of my
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:53.160]   thing in my area, because I'm one of the few ones in my area. But anywhere in the United States,
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:35:00.920]   you would probably start with the state professional naturopathic organization.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:07.480]   Oh, okay. You know, you know, there's always, oh, almost always one in every single state.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:16.200]   There's a national organization, AANP, National Association of Naturopathic Physicians,
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:24.360]   which can point you to your state. But not all naturopaths are registered with AANP.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:34.040]   So it's kind of tricky in some cases, but, you know, you definitely start, you know, Googling with
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:42.680]   naturopathic physician, you know, or state licensed or, you know, so it is kind of tricky.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:47.480]   Okay. Yeah. Okay. So I've got like, so there's an American Association of
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:53.560]   naturopathic physicians and they might have a, I guess they've got like a finder, find a doctor
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:36:00.120]   thing here. Okay. Okay. So that's one way to doing it. Yeah, because, okay, all right, that's good.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.840]   And then so that's how you would find someone in your area and would you have any, you know,
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:10.280]   because you've been doing it so long and I'm sure as in any industry, right, there's good apples
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.520]   and bad apples and, you know, is there anything you want to kind of like, would share with someone
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:18.440]   and say, hey, you know, if you're in, if you're looking for someone, this is what you would look
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:24.600]   for to find someone who's qualified or experienced or reputable, you know, is there any kind of advice
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.480]   you would give someone along those lines on how to pick the right one or how to find the right
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:36.040]   person? Well, you're fine to doctor thing right here. So find a doctor. If they're on this list,
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:43.080]   does that kind of mean they're vetted? So that means that they have gone through actual medical
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:49.160]   school with the clinic and are licenseable, which means you've taken national boards.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:58.520]   So the tricky thing is, is that some of the traditional naturopaths will call themselves
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:03.000]   board certified, and that's a clue that they've never gone through medical school.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:11.960]   So the certification should be from, you know, the state and national level. There's, I forget what
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:21.400]   it's called, the College of National something, something that licenses all the naturopathic schools.
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:29.960]   So you kind of need to be able to see what their training is and what their credentials are, but
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:36.760]   that see, that doesn't mean that somebody who hasn't, hasn't been, you know, to medical school
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:41.720]   isn't good in their particular area. You know what I'm saying?
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:46.760]   Yeah. It's really kind of confusing. Right. Yeah, that's kind of what my first question
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.800]   always, you know, whenever I'm dealing with anybody is like, what's your credentials? Like,
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:55.960]   what do you really, you know, you know, just, but yeah, I just, I looked up my zip code and there's
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:01.960]   only one person in my whole town. Wow. Yeah, that's amazing. But at least there's the one I should
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:06.440]   reach out to that person. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So, you know, kind of joked about it once in our
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:13.000]   telegram chat group, where I wanted to start like a wellness center. And I'm still thinking about it,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.080]   you know, I would just love to hook up with like-minded individuals and just
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:23.720]   and leverage each other's skills and talents, you know, just to help people. That's just my
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.840]   purpose at this point in life. But okay, so, so that's kind of how you find someone. So that
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:34.680]   website, again, is the American Association of naturopathic positions. There's a find a doctor
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:41.240]   section here. And then you would, again, you know, just take a look at their how long they've been
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:46.120]   doing it. And of course, their credentials and depending on what state don't get caught up and
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:50.840]   whether they're licensed, because some states don't, right? And so forth. Okay. All right,
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:57.560]   that's how you find someone. So then can we just talk about some, like, just some cases, you know,
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:03.240]   like, like, I would love to hear some of your success stories. Because I think that's the thing,
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   but I think the biggest thing that I know from all the experiences I've had trying to help people,
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:16.040]   myself included is that the first step is overcoming that fear, you know, of having to
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:22.040]   take responsibility for my health when when you come to that realization where you get so
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:27.640]   frustrated because you haven't shown any improvement for so long with your doctor. And then usually,
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:33.160]   you know, what people normally do switch doctors, you know, so when I was in Honolulu, I had, I think
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:38.360]   maybe five different doctors through the my HMO where I just finally said, you know, and so this
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.920]   kind of like it's really silly where you just keep kind of, you know, it's like, it's, you go to,
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.920]   you go to it, you know, you just keep going back for more, you know, whatever you want to call it,
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:52.360]   but no results, no results, no results, whatever the problem might be. And then after a while,
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:58.200]   you just like, okay, I, you know, you want to just instead of switching doctors, quote, in that,
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.920]   in the medical field, why don't you switch different types of doctors, you know, doctors that are
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:08.440]   skilled and other things. So I, you know, I just want to hear like, what would be when that person
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.400]   finally makes that decision and says, you know, man, this is not working out. This is not working
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:16.360]   out. My child is not getting better. And you know, these terrified mothers, you know, they,
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:21.560]   that you, you talk with right there that they're just, you know, when your kid is not getting better
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:25.400]   of whatever their problem is, it's terrifying. And that's the worst feeling you could ever have
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:31.320]   as human being, is when your kid's sick, and you can't get help. I'm sure you see that a lot.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:39.080]   And so, so they overcome that fear, that fear of I'm going to try something outside of my, you
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:44.440]   know, just just absolute outside of my reference. So they would say, I'm going to try a different
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:49.800]   kind of doctor, a naturopathic doctor, or a Chinese traditional medicine doctor, or et cetera,
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:55.880]   right? When they come to you, and they've kind of crossed that, you know, that fear boundary of,
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:00.040]   I'm going to take responsibility for my own health. I'm going to go and check out something else,
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.040]   make that decision. Of course, everybody around them's going, no, that's not a good idea. Their
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:08.600]   health insurance is going, no, we don't cover it. You know, I mean, can you talk a little bit about
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:12.840]   I mean, do you, do you encounter that where people are just, you know, I mean, or is that just,
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.600]   is that's just I'm making that up in my own head? And that's not, that's, it's not that complicated.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:22.840]   No, no, but what are you, what are you asking the question? My question is, is, you know, like,
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:27.400]   okay, first of all, what's that trigger that gets people to reach out to naturopathic doctors?
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:33.240]   And it's kind of, you know, like what draws them to you, we kind of covered that earlier, right?
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.080]   About two thirds of them are just frustrated. And it just takes that bit of courage. I'm just
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:41.720]   mentioning it because it really was a huge deal in my life when I took that stand and said, look,
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:47.720]   no more, no more of this and fired my doctor. And I went down the organic path. And then when
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:52.440]   they come to you, can we talk about like just some real life case studies of people that have come
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.920]   to you and they're just at their wit's end? And, and, and what did what happened? I mean, you know,
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:02.840]   like you have any stories that pop up in your head about certain things that were just at their
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:07.400]   wit's end, they came to you and, and then all of a sudden, you know, things just started getting better.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:19.880]   Yeah, so one of my recent patients who came in a young man who has had diabetes for 30 years,
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:30.360]   had a heart attack. And he had open source on his feet. And he had been to the doctors, you know,
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:38.760]   and they tried to put him on all these meds. And he refused. And he basically dumped all the drugs
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:48.600]   and started going keto and fasting and looking at all the herbs. And he got himself pretty far.
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:57.080]   But when he came to me, he couldn't get the blood flow. It was compromised to his feet.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:06.200]   And so we're now working on the blood flow to his feet. And I'm using my ITERRA care wand,
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:16.520]   which is, you know, frequency. I'm using PEMF. We're using herbs and diet. And his, and he also
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:24.600]   went to a podiatrist. And because he threw some things that we talked about, figured out that
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   he's not walking correctly on the bones of his feet. And so he got a boot. And it's made a huge
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:40.360]   difference. So we've only seen a little bit of progress so far, but he seemed to be well on his
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:53.240]   way to healing. So that's just one small part. So another young lady who came to see me
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:44:00.680]   was having huge migraines and really a lot of problems with her gut. And so
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:12.680]   we've been doing a lot of actually myofascial unwinding and some energy hands-on energy work.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:20.680]   But, you know, things, so I gave her things like magnesium. We worked with hydration. We worked with
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:28.120]   diet a little bit. But then we reached a point where she was actually having more gut issues and
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:36.760]   things were happening. And we're not progressing. And right at the same time, I was studying oxalates
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:42.920]   and doing my little rabbit hole deep dive into that. And I just said to where I said, like, you
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:50.760]   know, let's start looking at oxalates, because he was eating a lot of tofu and citan. I think
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:58.440]   that's how you pronounce it. That weird meat substitute. Yeah, that weird meat thing. She's
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:03.880]   eating a lot of textured vegetable protein, which is soy. And I said, why don't? Yeah, I know right.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:12.280]   I'm a meat girl. That's a massive endocrine disruptor, right? Yeah. And so I said, well,
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:18.280]   let's look at, let's just try, you know, getting off of those, get off as many of the really big
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:26.840]   oxalate things, you know, no spinach, no almonds, and no fake meat. And it was like, within a few
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:36.120]   weeks, her gut was perfect. And she felt, yeah, way more energy that headaches reduced.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:44.280]   So she's, I mean, she's just like, almost, she's, I'd say 80%, 80, 85% better.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:53.080]   She refuses to get off her birth control, though. So I can't, I can't do anything with her,
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:57.960]   because her hormones are related, her migraines are related to our hormones. And I basically
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:02.680]   told her straight up, I can't, I can't adjust that until you get off of those. And you know,
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:07.080]   your hormones, your migraines, we're only going to be able to do so much about that,
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:14.120]   you know, because they're hormonal related, and you're on a drug for that. But that's one of,
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:21.800]   one of the best and fastest turnarounds I've seen diet-wise. Now, the other thing, so I'm a big
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:29.480]   mineral and full of a cuminic acid and dirt person. Any kind of clay, dirt, mud, minerals,
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:35.560]   I'm all about it. So I had this one, actually my massage therapist husband,
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:42.760]   she wanted him to come in and see me. Of course, you know, she had already mentioned a few things
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:49.800]   about me. And one of the things she said was, it's last naturopath fired him. Oh, I'm like, oh,
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:54.840]   great. Yeah, it's a good start. Yeah. I'm hard to work with on them. I want to let you know ahead.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:47:00.120]   Right. Right. At least they have a warning. They should have a, you know. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:07.800]   She had clued me in with some things about his family of origin and his birth that, you know,
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:14.680]   I stuck in the back of my head. And when we, he came in and we met, I went over all, that was a
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:20.760]   long, that was a two-hour appointment going over all the things and asking him every single question
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:26.920]   I could think of. And I started going down the rabbit hole of things that had happened. He was
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:32.760]   born with drugs in his system. And so I basically explained what happened to him neurologically when
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:38.920]   he was born and how that affected him and how that's affecting him now. And we pulled together
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:47.800]   all kinds of brain things, birth order things, you know, how you were born in that trauma,
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:57.000]   family of origin trauma, linked it to adrenaline, adrenals, a diet issues going on right now,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:07.960]   along with mood disorder. And it was like, boom, light bulb. And I put him on minerals and some
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:16.840]   brain mushrooms and, you know, working on his diet some and the first appointment when he came in.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:21.880]   Number one, it was a big win. He was actually taking the supplements. So I was thrilled.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:31.640]   Number two, he said, within days, he felt a shift. And I got to say, that's one of the best
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:37.800]   responses I've ever seen. And it was mainly to the minerals. He was so mineral deficient
[00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:48.360]   that just giving him minerals made a huge difference. Yeah, you're hitting on every single thing that
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:55.800]   I'm just passionate about. Yeah, the whole mineral thing. Well, that concludes part one of this

[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.640]   the part two of the discussion was where we really started talking about
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:09.640]   all of the really important things you should be doing for the core processes of your body that
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:15.080]   dictate your health. And we went into it in quite detail about, you know, everything from
