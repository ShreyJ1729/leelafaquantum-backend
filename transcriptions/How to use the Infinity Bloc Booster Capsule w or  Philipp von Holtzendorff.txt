[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.480]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer.
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.800]   And I've got on the line my great friend, Phillip Samor of
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.120]   Von Holson-Dorf of Leila Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade and
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.040]   Trami Ease with me.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.040]   And we're going to be going over the how to use the Infinity
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.920]   Block booster capsule in this video.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.680]   So hello, Phillip.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.280]   How are you doing out there in internet land?
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.200]   Hey, Kay.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.960]   I'm doing great.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.000]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.960]   Hey, all right.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.640]   Everyone's kind of been waiting to find the answers to their
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.200]   questions.
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.960]   So let's just jump right in.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.440]   So the very first topic, obviously, is this brand new
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.560]   Infinity Block booster capsule.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.960]   And so this is right off of the website in terms of what it does.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.240]   So, you know, do you have a, do you have like an elevator pitch
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.160]   on what does this capsule do?
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.720]   So we basically developed it so that existing owners often
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.440]   Infinity Block or Infinity Block package did not have to purchase
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.080]   the new upgraded Infinity Blocks that we just came up with,
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.720]   which are absolutely next level.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.960]   I mean, you know, the power of those are just ridiculous.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.960]   And they contain the new features, you know, that also the
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.120]   grand block and the latest travel blocks already contained.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.560]   They're extremely high vibrating on the Hawkins scale.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.760]   And so this booster capsule, if you place it in the middle of an
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.000]   existing assembled Infinity Block for 20 minutes at minimum,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.320]   that's also enough.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.680]   You know, after that, nothing really happens anymore, but it
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.440]   should be minimum 20 minutes, exactly like the picture shows.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.640]   It uploads those latest features that all of the Infinity
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.640]   Blocks that were purchased up to the end of 2023, basically, I
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.560]   didn't have, and it also really boosts the Hawkins level of these
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.400]   Infinity Blocks.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.800]   I mean, in very, very rare instances, an Infinity Block
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.720]   may be already close to that, but it's quite unlikely, even a
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.840]   version, you know, IV18 or something like that wouldn't get
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.520]   close to this.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.320]   And at the same time, you know, at such levels, it would also get
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.480]   quite hard to take for a lot of people, because the energy
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.960]   without those additional features would not have been as smooth,
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.120]   especially for people that are not used to high consciousness
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.920]   fields or a lot of quantum energy.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.360]   So that's basically, in the nutshell, what it does, so it
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.160]   smoothes out the energy, it really increases the level on the
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.600]   Hawkins scale up, put the new features into these blocks.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.560]   And for anyone that has an Infinity Block package or has
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.720]   had this, you know, you can put this capsule into both of those
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.480]   and then both of them will be upgraded and boosted that way.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.080]   And then you will be able to continue for the future, also
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.040]   the wonderful functionality of the package that you can further
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.120]   upgrade your Infinity Blocks caution, big, big caution.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.840]   I would suggest to not do that anytime soon.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.600]   Maybe wait, we do six months, really, because, you know, these
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.200]   are very, very high levels.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.680]   It's quite unheard of.
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.320]   So it was even with the capsule, as well as the new Infinity
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.640]   Blocks, we were really stopping also for a moment if we should
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.040]   really do it, because it's it's very high levels, but it was
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.880]   the right thing to do.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.480]   Okay, cool.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.800]   So let me just point out a couple of things to make sure everyone's
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.680]   really clear on it.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.160]   So when you're saying that it'll elevate the energy of your
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.200]   Infinity Block, you know, to 2700 on the scale, bottom line.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.120]   Oh, that means that that's just an Infinity Block Generation
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.920]   one straight from Layla.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.360]   You haven't done anything to it.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.280]   You just came right from the factory, so to speak, you know, it's
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.080]   off the shelf.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.520]   I put this thing in and that that and then the Infinity Block,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.240]   if it's like an older one prior to January of 2024, you've got an
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.720]   older Infinity Block and then you put that capsule inside the
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.600]   middle, and then all of a sudden now you boosted this thing up to
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.840]   2700, right?
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.400]   And so that's just like generation one, because there's tons of
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.080]   people like myself who have different, like a generation eight
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.840]   and nine, there's people out there.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.160]   I know like a 15, you know, but but it doesn't matter at all.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.920]   Okay, so let's get it.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.920]   It doesn't matter at all.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.720]   Like if you have a 15, if you have an eight, if you have a one,
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.600]   it all doesn't matter.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.040]   You put the capsule in and it'll end up at 2700.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.760]   Okay, we'll have upgraded all these features.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.480]   I also answered that a couple of times in the group.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.800]   I probably wasn't read by a lot of people because I never
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.720]   placed it into a pin post, but it completely does not matter.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.160]   If you have an IB 10, 50 and 16, 18, one, three, four, five, it
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.120]   really doesn't matter because you couldn't have, as I just said,
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.960]   you couldn't have gotten it even with a 15 or 16 to 2700.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.240]   Okay, because this is, I kind of created this chart to try to
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.720]   kind of understand, you know, like what the where you would end up.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.520]   Okay, so you're saying, just for clarity sake, that you're
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.320]   saying no matter what generation I put that capsule in.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.440]   So like for me, I've got an eight and a nine.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.880]   So if I put that boost capsule inside my eight and my nine, no matter,
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.200]   it doesn't matter where they're at today, they're going to end up at 2700.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.560]   So they don't end up at IB eight plus 2700.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.720]   They just kept at 2700.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.080]   Absolutely.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.320]   And there may be one, one difference.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.400]   I have no clue if someone has an IB 20 where that is, I have no clue.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.480]   We have not tested that.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.560]   We don't hold so many different types of blocks.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:58.560]   So maybe with some generation, someone may have gotten already to 2750.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.920]   But I highly doubt it, to be honest.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:08.680]   And so, you know, in 99.5% of the cases, people will end up right there no matter
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.960]   which infinity book they've had.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.880]   OK, yeah, you know, because just let you know, in the last three years,
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.240]   there's only been one person that ever said that that they reached IB 20.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.120]   And they were never heard from again.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.840]   So who knows?
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.240]   They reached another level of consciousness.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.080]   OK, so, but OK, so here you go.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.200]   So if you've got an IB one, which is from the, you know, from Layla,
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.800]   that's an off the shelf, right, old, you know, older version, it came in at 733.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.200]   And then there was a newer version that came in at 942.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.600]   And so if you I'm sorry, an IB four is 942.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.240]   And then we, you know, we had 1152 was an IB seven blah, blah, blah.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.400]   That's if you just upgrade, but bottom line, no matter where you're at,
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.280]   no matter what generation you have, if you use a capsule, the end result will be
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.960]   that IB you're holding that you just boosted is equal to 2700.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.160]   So I've got a list of questions that will get more into it.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.680]   Obviously, there's questions like, OK, what happens next after that?
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.640]   But I just let me just get back to the points.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.480]   I want to make sure we cover that the capsule has no spheres, right?
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.840]   And it does have the same harmony and buffering feature that the
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.640]   Grand Block and the travel block block have, right?
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.520]   So it's the same features now.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.640]   Correct. OK, great.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.080]   So so it's like exactly this.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.000]   So it's basically you've turned the infinity block now using this capsule.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.640]   You've turned it into something that, you know, basically a Grand Block.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.040]   It's even higher than a Grand Block now with the same feature.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.200]   So OK, so it's got those features in it.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.520]   And then afterwards, this is a, we had a lot of questions.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.560]   I'll get them into that about wearing it.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.520]   It's like, what do I do with the capsule once I'm done boosting my IB?
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.280]   So we'll talk about that.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.920]   And then, of course, there's no spheres.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.200]   The other thing I do want to mention real quick to everyone watching is that I
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:03.480]   do know that the first like week or two of the capsules going out, it didn't
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.200]   contain the handout that's supposed to go with it.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.120]   They weren't printed yet.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.400]   And that was just, you know, a story about that, guys.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.360]   So if you didn't get the handout and you want to get the handout, which are
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.480]   the instructions and a few of the FAQs, it's like a three pager, I'll put a link
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.280]   in the in the video description below so you can get a copy of the handout.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.080]   If you did not get one when you got your capsule.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:24.440]   All right.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.560]   So but again, really quickly, the way to do this, really simple.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.680]   Put it in the IB for 20 minutes.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.400]   Done.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.160]   That's it, really.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.480]   And then all of a sudden you've got these great new features and your
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   infinity block is at 2700.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.880]   OK, so let's jump into some of the questions.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.040]   Now this is questions off of the handout.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.280]   So let me just ask you, Philip, if you don't mind, I'll just throw the
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.680]   questions out at you and you just give me a quick answer and we'll just jump to
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.640]   the next one.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.640]   OK, so general FAQs that were in the handout.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.240]   You know, can I use the booster capsule with any generation?
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.840]   I think you answered that already.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.360]   OK, number two, do I need to use spheres with the booster capsule?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   No, not at all.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.640]   It comes empty, right?
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.400]   It comes empty.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.640]   And so in order to use it as a booster capsule, you don't need spheres, right?
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.000]   But if you want to wear it when you're done using it to boost your IB or your
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.880]   infinity block, that's another subject.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.240]   We'll cover that in a second.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.280]   OK, number three, can I continue to upgrade my infinity blocks after I boost
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:22.800]   them?
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.640]   And you just answered that earlier as well.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.080]   You said, yes, but I but there is a question about that.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.640]   We had someone post this morning today is January 17th, it's Wednesday.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.760]   So this morning, someone posted in there, they boosted both of their
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.520]   IBs and all of a sudden they're ordering was recording them having less deep
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:45.560]   sleep, more ram, I think, but it affected their sleep by having these two mega
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.480]   infinity blocks in their house.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.520]   So I recommended that they disassemble.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.400]   You know, disassemble one of them because, you know, just kind of conveying
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.160]   that, hey, having two of these in your house, having one of them alone is quite
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.120]   a lot, and then having two is, you know, so obviously they've had two
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.320]   infinity blocks, they upgraded, they, you know, not upgraded, they boosted
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.720]   both of them and then it affected their sleep.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.440]   So I guess the question is not not just, oh, yeah, you could do this,
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.320]   but should people, this is my question, should people wait to do both?
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.840]   And, you know, what do you, what are your thoughts and recommendation on
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.320]   doing that?
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.720]   Because, you know, it is quite a lot, right?
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.080]   To have two of these things in your house.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.240]   Blood alone.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.240]   Yes, there's quite a lot.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.480]   Yep. So it really depends on the, on the people, because, you know, some
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.240]   people may be totally fine with boosting both of them at the same time.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.800]   Um, and some may not.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.680]   So if you're not sure, then just do one and then just see, look at the energy.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.040]   You know, feel it for a while, you know, take it in for a week or two.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.360]   And then whenever you feel called, do the next one, if you already
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:55.040]   now boosted both and then you feel your sleep is affected or you feel in general,
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.440]   that, oh, wow, this is a lot more energy than I thought.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:04.120]   Just de-assemble one, um, or put one in a, you know, different location in your
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.480]   office or, you know, wherever that's a little bit further away.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:13.440]   And then, you know, give it a week or two, drink a little more.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:19.240]   And then you can probably, you know, take in the second one as well.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:24.400]   You know, we adjust quite quickly to this because, you know, the energy is so
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.840]   natural and so smooth with the human cells that it doesn't take that much, but
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.440]   indeed, you know, it can, can still take a few days or in some cases a week or two
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.400]   until we have more adjusted.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:44.520]   And if you, if it affects your sleep, then it's a little bit more than you should
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.920]   take in at the moment.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.040]   OK, yeah, so yeah, I was thinking that it's prudent, probably to not boost
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.600]   them at the same time, but boost one weight, you know, like I would do with
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.800]   anything, uh, wait, see how it goes, feel it, get used to it, a cackle made,
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.000]   then boost the second, but then you're also telling people, even after you've
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.080]   boosted both and you're on your upgrade path, you know, you should wait to upgrade
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.000]   after you boost, right?
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.280]   So, you know, in other words, don't just upgrade right away.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:17.040]   Uh, because once I upgrade a boosted infinity block, am I further increasing
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.240]   the level?
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.960]   Like, yes, you are.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.920]   And that's what's going to go higher than the lead.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.840]   Wait three to six months.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.880]   And those, those changes won't be small, by the way.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.280]   So definitely wait.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.320]   So there's no way we can prevent that.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:41.200]   OK, so just for some basic math, I know that the, the, the estimated, uh,
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.480]   increase in, in quantum energy strength as measured in consciousness levels,
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.360]   right, is around six and a half every time I upgrade, you know, we round off
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.120]   at seven, right?
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.560]   So that's still correct.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.040]   Yeah, it has nothing to do with the organ scale though.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:56.600]   Oh, OK.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.880]   So it's a different scale.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:03.120]   So, but, but a bottom line, though, if I take a boosted, if I have two boosted
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.960]   infinity blocks and I, let's say, you know, take the precaution and I wait,
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.040]   you know, six months, make sure I'm coming, you know, everybody in my
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.160]   household's jiving with this new level of energy.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:18.440]   But if I upgrade, if I start upgrading again after I boosted, it's going to go
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.160]   up by like seven times that.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:25.560]   Well, not on the Hawkins scale, not on the Hawkins scale, but it's going to
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.720]   increase in energy, right?
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.640]   Yes.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.840]   Yes, for sure.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.040]   Quite a bit, actually.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.520]   That's what I was kind of thinking.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.160]   I was just, do you have math for that?
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:37.120]   Cause there's a lot of people that are really, really, really into the math.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.800]   And I'm trying to convey in the, in the group that it's really hard to put
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.520]   numbers to this.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:42.880]   But yeah.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.760]   So you just answered my question, you know, we don't have math and we also
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.920]   don't have the experience at this point.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.400]   Like because we, we literally haven't done three or four upgrades with these
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.280]   because it, it felt right to launch these right now as is.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.880]   But sorry, guys, we can't tell you right now.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.640]   If you upgrade it twice a word, it's going to be, I'm just telling you, don't
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:10.040]   upgrade it at least three to six months for the, until you do the first time.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.600]   You know, be very mindful.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.560]   Yeah, thank you for that.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.840]   You know, I totally relate.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.640]   I mean, if you, you know, for you guys listening to this video, try to imagine
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.800]   how many different scenarios all of you guys out there have, you know, and then
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.400]   for, you know, Layla to try to test every possible combination would be like
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.320]   a full-time job for two, three people, you know, and so it's just, you know, in
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.040]   order to roll this stuff out, that stuff, that's not happening.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.680]   Uh, so the lot of times, unfortunately, the question, the answers are, we don't
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.880]   know, uh, okay.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.640]   So number four, a question is, how do I know it's working?
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.040]   What would be your thoughts for that?
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.840]   How do you do, you know, what is working?
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.920]   The after after I posted, how do I know that it's boosted?
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.680]   You know, I guess that's the question.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.400]   If you waited for 20 minutes, then you know, it is boosted.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:58.920]   It's done.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.240]   Okay.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.840]   So you did that's how you know it.
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:01.400]   Okay.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.840]   Most people will feel it, uh, if you're, if someone can feel it, can perceive any
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.720]   energy whatsoever, if you're not noticing any difference, you just will have to
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.560]   have waited for 20 minutes and then it will have happened.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.360]   Okay.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.600]   Okay.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.080]   So now we did have a question in the group, uh, basically it's like, Hey, no
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.680]   matter what infinity block generation one you have, uh, whether it's the first
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:30.040]   version, second version or the third version, which is now 3,800, but can I
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.560]   boost a 3,800 level IB?
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.080]   If I bought one right today, I took a 38.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.760]   Could I use the booster capsule in it?
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.200]   Cause wouldn't that be going backwards?
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.840]   I mean, is it possible to know?
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.040]   It wouldn't do anything.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.640]   You can put the capsule in all you want.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.240]   And as long as you want, it's not going to do anything.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.440]   So don't use it for that.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.840]   It's, it's not meant for that.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.400]   It's not going to do anything.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:53.840]   Okay.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.000]   So it's not going to change it.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.640]   You're still going to end up with 3,800.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:56.920]   Okay.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.040]   So you can't go above that on a, on a brand new one, cause it's already got to
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.680]   built in, right?
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:00.960]   Kind of.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.200]   Okay.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:02.920]   All right.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:03.520]   So there's that.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:03.720]   Okay.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.920]   So these are some great, great answers.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.480]   All right.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.040]   So now let me jump into the questions from the telegram group.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.880]   Now the, I kind of consolidated the ones about people had questions about
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.280]   wearing the booster capsule.
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.560]   So the first one here is, is, you know, is the Hawkins level.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.560]   So I guess it's not Hawkins level.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.840]   So there's the level of the booster capsule 27 is the capsule itself.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.480]   2,700. No.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.040]   No.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.320]   Okay.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.360]   So what is it?
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.120]   That is, it doesn't really matter what it is on actually.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.600]   And, and it's, it really for capsules anyway, that doesn't matter.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.360]   This is a very special capsule.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.760]   And what it does, it, it brings the infinity block to 700, 2,700.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.760]   But itself, it's, it's just, that's not how it works.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.240]   There's nothing actually I can.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.800]   I don't even know how to answer that question.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.600]   Um, so it really, it's not the same.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.960]   Even, so let's, let's say you have a 2,200 grand blog and you charge a capsule.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.480]   And that the capsule itself will not vibrate at 2,200.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.040]   It's, it's actually impossible to do that way because a blog and a capsule
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.800]   or a card or something like that are completely different things.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.000]   Okay.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.600]   I think that's where the confusion lies where people, there's a lot of people
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:25.720]   that are thinking that capsules and cards and coasters and all that stuff,
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.360]   the callers, that they all have consciousness levels.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.800]   Um, and I, and they do.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.400]   Okay.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.520]   And they do, but it's, it's completely different.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.760]   If you have a multi dimensional quantum energy space, like the blogs do.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.200]   Right.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:40.400]   Okay.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.840]   And then it's, it's different from, let's say a capsule or a card that, that
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.240]   just has a quantum energy field with specific frequencies and so on.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:55.640]   And, and then also again, like this gooster capsule is not like any other capsule.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:01.960]   It's something that we crafted in a very special, with a very special method.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:08.160]   So you also can't compare it to just, okay, this is not like me charging a coin
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.120]   and a grand blog, you know, it's, it's just different.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:17.880]   This is designed to upload functionality and things like that.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.000]   So it's, it's a completely different model.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.960]   Okay.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.200]   You know, actually, actually, you know, as you're talking, I have this metaphor
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.160]   pops in my head.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:33.520]   So tell me if this metaphor applies, but I look at it like, you know, a, when
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.680]   you're saying this quantum space, you know, I'm thinking like the difference
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.560]   between a light bulb and a glow in the dark stick.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.760]   A light bulb emits light, a glow in the dark stick is just emitting light,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.040]   but it's, it's not powered.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.600]   It's, it's basically, you know, it has the energy in it and it's emitting, right?
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.640]   Whereas the light is just, you know, it's actually like this light bulb.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.120]   It's putting out light and it's so much brighter and it's, it's, it's powered up
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:04.040]   and there's this huge difference in strength and the type of device emitting light.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.280]   You know, that's just what popped in my head, I guess.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.960]   So I'm, I'm flattering.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.040]   That's just what it is, possibly a very good picture for people.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.280]   So, okay.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.560]   So, yeah, so they're completely different devices.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.240]   They don't really have the levels of consciousness that a, that a block would have.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.800]   So, uh, so you're saying, you know, you haven't really quite measured the actual
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.360]   capsule, the capsule itself.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:30.560]   So, and then so if people add five spheres to that capsule, uh, is it going to be
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.720]   like any other capsule where every single sphere kicks it up a notch in terms of
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.120]   energy strength and, and the field gets bigger?
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.760]   Well, so in this case, it will probably add a little bit depending on the spheres,
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.640]   you know, uh, but if it's just the regular, you know, he'll capsule spheres.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.440]   He'll probably add a little bit.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.520]   Okay.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.960]   So by itself, it's, it's more energetic than a, like a card.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.080]   Yes, definitely, especially this one.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:01.680]   Okay.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.320]   So would it be the same?
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.120]   Would it be on par with the Olympic and super capsule?
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.400]   Meaning it in terms of like energy level?
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:14.400]   Cause you know, you already have that sort of sort of, but it, but then again,
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.120]   it doesn't contain any specific frequencies.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:17.720]   That's okay.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.320]   Uh, but then, you know, that the super capsule doesn't either.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.920]   So you could, yeah, I don't know.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.040]   You could possibly even take, you know, frequency and add it to that.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.920]   You know, that's certainly something that could be done, but it's, it's, uh, you
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.440]   know, it's, it's, it's stronger than.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:42.440]   Uh, then, uh, uh, what's called the super capsule.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.400]   It is stronger than that.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.360]   Okay.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:45.840]   All right.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.280]   All right.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.600]   So that's good to know, uh, but there's no frequency.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.400]   So a booster capsule by itself is stronger than a super capsule.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.240]   Uh, it doesn't need spheres, but you could add it to it.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.440]   It would kick it up a notch.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.960]   There are no frequencies in it.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.840]   So that's good to know.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.200]   Um, so because it doesn't have any frequencies than it, you just, if, well,
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.960]   what is it, you know, what does it do if I wear it?
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.600]   Well, it just provides you with quantum energy, right?
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.400]   Just just like an empty super capsule would.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.040]   Um, so then the other question number three would be, uh, you know, if
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.400]   somebody wanted to put spheres in it, um, uh, can they order them from you?
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.400]   Or they'd have to go figure out how to get, you know, because that was another
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.280]   question is, you know, a lot, you know, people that want to put spheres in them.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.800]   Um, could they get them from you?
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.480]   Or what do you recommend?
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:35.080]   Yeah, we actually don't offer any extra spheres.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.440]   The way we're set up, uh, is that we just don't have any, you know,
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.160]   single spheres without capsule that we offer.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.880]   So people would have to get them elsewhere.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:52.720]   But I, I would think that the vast majority of people that have such a booster capsule.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.400]   Now they also have some other capsule.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:01.800]   They may have the heal capsule or one of your booster capsules and just take
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.760]   the spheres from there and put them in.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.960]   You know, I think, you know, that's the way to go.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.280]   You know, one, you really wears two capsules at the same time.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.600]   At least no one that I know.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.400]   I think the thing is, is people see that they get an extra capsule.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.640]   They spend, you know, a little bit of money on it and they want to, they
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.560]   want to basically have, um, you know, give it to one of their family members
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.480]   to wear, right?
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.920]   Um, they can.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.760]   They can wear just with all the spheres.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.160]   So they can just, they don't need to happen.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:29.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.520]   We don't need this.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.240]   No need.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.040]   Absolutely.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.960]   That's, I think, a key point there because there's one individual.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.600]   Molly was asking, you know, it's like, well, in a hurt, she's implying that, hey,
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.000]   you know, I, I use my heel and my Olympic capsule.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.960]   They're being, you know, two people are using them.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.160]   I have a third person.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.920]   I want to be able to give the ID booster capsule to, but it's empty.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.640]   Can I take a couple of spheres out of one and a couple of spheres out of the other
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.000]   and put them in there, you know, so that everyone's got two or three spheres in,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.960]   in their capsules.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.920]   Obviously the answer is yes, but it's going to be really confusing to kind of put
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.520]   it all back together again when you're done, uh, because of the energy levels
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.440]   are different, uh, but, you know, but I guess if you're going to do that, you
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.120]   know, the other question was, is like, yes, you can go ahead and do that, uh,
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.920]   hard to keep track of what spheres go to what capsule when you want to put it
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.800]   all back together.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.680]   That's number one thing I think would be an issue.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:22.520]   Uh, but the other question was, is should they charge them in the boosted
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:27.760]   infinity block first before they put it in a booster capsule or just put them in.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.040]   This fears, that's totally up to them.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:37.760]   You know, if you feel you want to get an additional level of energy really in
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.760]   and then go for it, you can definitely do that.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:48.520]   And if it matters what the, what the person feels, I know that, you know, most
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:52.680]   people want to have math and they want to have a very clear manual on how these
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.920]   things work for everyone, but it literally is different for each one of us.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.760]   And we can notice that through how we feel.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:09.440]   So that's why I'm, I'm sounding like a broken record because I keep telling
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.040]   people that it may not be the answer that they want to hear, but that really is
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:14.480]   the key.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.360]   Yeah, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, I totally see that.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.760]   Hey, just as an FY, everybody out there, uh, if you go to my blog, um,
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:27.920]   in my Layla Q and her quantum energy section of my blog, I do maintain a list
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.800]   of all the kinds of stuff you would want to get to tinker around with your block.
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.520]   So if you wanted to try to find some spheres, um, from like Etsy and stuff,
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.800]   I've actually got links for that and blank cards and all the stuff that Layla
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.400]   does not sell, uh, you know, other caps, blank capsules.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.640]   You want to make your own all that kind of stuff.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.680]   So, uh, you just go to my blog link in the video description below.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.760]   Anyway, uh, okay.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.960]   So, um, used to, you know, and let's see, these are questions, uh, that are all
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.520]   around, you know, once I've boosted my infinity blog, now question questions, right?
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.320]   So let me just run these past you.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.680]   Number one is the boost permanent, you know, the harmony feature in the level.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.720]   Right is it doesn't wear off, right?
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.480]   It's just permanent.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.440]   Correct.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.440]   It is permanent.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:10.760]   All right.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.400]   Number two, if I have two IVs, can I boost both?
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.360]   Yeah, we covered that.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.080]   Should I wait?
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:15.840]   We covered that.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.720]   Number three, wouldn't using the booster capsule twice overcharge it?
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:33.120]   No, not really because it's well, I mean, it sort of is already overcharged.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:33.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.000]   But it doesn't contain any specific frequencies, right?
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.120]   You certainly, you know, if you put it somewhat close to an orange juice, you
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.560]   know, you're going to amp up the orange juice, you know, I mean, that, that is, you
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.600]   can't avoid that with that capsule.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:57.360]   Um, and since it's already so powerful, if you put it in some other block, uh, you
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.960]   know, nothing really is going to, oh, okay, it's not going to change it.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.000]   Like, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.200]   No, I, I get it because I was thinking about that too.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.640]   And I was thinking, well, this thing is super powerful, more powerful than the
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.920]   infinity block you're putting it in.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.600]   So there's no way that the, there's no way that the infinity block you're putting
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.640]   it in is going to affect the capsule because the capsule is stronger and it's
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.880]   going to affect the infinity block.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.880]   So if you do it twice, you still don't ever get to the point where you, the, where
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:30.200]   the infinity block overcharges the capsule because it's just so much.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.120]   Yes.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:31.480]   Okay.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.040]   So that's that.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.120]   So no, it doesn't.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:33.320]   Okay.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.000]   Number four, how long should I wait to upgrade?
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:36.160]   Okay.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.320]   We covered that one, right?
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.960]   So boosting twice, give it a few weeks, but upgrading after boosting, give it a few
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.440]   months.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:49.440]   Number five, after boosting does its field, does the blocks feel get bigger?
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.360]   Because it's obviously increased massively in strength.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.880]   So the field is right now about a kilometer.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.080]   I mean, anybody got a good guess how bigger it gets.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:07.560]   I don't know, but my guess it's going to be at least two kilometers.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.520]   That's just a sensible field.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:15.960]   And then in terms of the EMF harmonization, you know, I, I want to remain
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.280]   conservative with that.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.040]   And I would just say, you know, because we, we haven't tested it.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:28.160]   Just still assume it covers 400 to 500 meters in terms of EMF harmonization.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:33.640]   And it may well do more, but, uh, you know, we, we haven't tested it.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.040]   So I don't want to make this assumption here right now.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:42.720]   But the field in general is going to be in general, larger and more powerful.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:43.760]   Okay.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:44.120]   Cool.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.480]   Um, figures better.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.800]   Okay.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.680]   Now, in this case, actually, it really is.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.440]   And that's the beauty about this.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.960]   Because, you know, it's interesting because obviously we, we started off, you
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.240]   know, with, with the infinity blog as the flagship product, right?
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.040]   And then it's sort of, and then especially the infinity blog package is like the
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.120]   absolute ultimate one, right?
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.840]   Because you can keep upgrading it.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:15.040]   But then, you know, we at some point bumped into opportunities to amp up
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.040]   everything to make the energy even smoother, to come up with these features
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:19.560]   and all of that.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:24.200]   And then suddenly the finished block wasn't the flagship product anymore.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.080]   And it really, you know, now you have the travel look, and you have the
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.280]   grand block and all of that.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:33.640]   And I've felt bad for the people that had this infinity block package, right?
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.200]   Because they could still upgrade.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.280]   But still they were left out with these new features.
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:43.440]   So I'm super stoked that we have this capsule now and that everyone can get
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:50.000]   this up to the ultimate new level and then keep using it to upgrade and all of that.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.200]   So, um, I think it's pretty cool.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.240]   I'm really happy with myself.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.400]   No, I'm, yeah, I was, I was very happy to get it.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.480]   I got mine in the mail like two days ago.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.400]   Um, I got to go get it back.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.880]   One of my Ibises with my daughter, but yeah, I'm totally looking forward to upgrading
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.400]   them because, you know, I've got the grand block, but I think people should
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:16.400]   realize that this is way stronger by 50% more than the grand block.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.680]   You know, after you boost your Ib.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.120]   So yeah, it's pretty powerful and it's a pretty cool thing.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.000]   Uh, okay.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.200]   So number six is, so the question here is, and these are asking people are asking,
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.640]   Hey, I got an older TB, right?
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.000]   It's like it's, it's weak as, you know, it's, it's, it's literally not weaker,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.520]   but it's the same strength of an infinity block generation one or two, right?
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.680]   Uh, and so can I upgrade my TB with this booster capsule?
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.160]   An older TB travel block?
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:50.480]   Um, no, it doesn't really work.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.800]   But what you could do, you could dissemble your old travel block.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.440]   And then once you have upgraded your infinity block, put it in and then you'll,
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.200]   you'll get it to, you know, um, higher levels.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.760]   Um, I think the features will already be there, but it will be a more powerful.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.520]   I don't know how powerful it will be.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.680]   Uh, we didn't measure that, but that's how I would go about that.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.040]   Okay.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.960]   And then for the new travel blocks that were purchased, like in the last, I would
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:24.800]   say eight, nine, 10 months or so, you know, uh, there's, there's nothing really, uh,
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.640]   to be done.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.560]   Okay.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.280]   All right.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:32.240]   So if you have one of the first generation travel blocks, you can put that
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.120]   in a boosted IB and upgrade it that way.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.040]   Don't use the capsule.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:36.920]   Okay.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:37.320]   Cool.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.000]   Cause that's actually another question too about doing that.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:45.640]   And if you're not certain, you know, when you purchase the travel block or, or,
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.100]   you know, if this would do something, you can just do it, you know, just put it
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:52.780]   in the assembly of the child block, put it in for 45 minutes.
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:56.340]   And then definitely it'll be at the highest possible level.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.340]   Uh, and yeah.
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.660]   So that's how I would do it.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.580]   In fact, okay.
[00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:04.740]   So it's safe to say that everybody could take anything they got from Layla or
[00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.500]   anything they made themselves.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.140]   And once, and if they want to amp up the strength, once they boosted their
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:15.900]   infinity block, they can recharge everything inside the boosted block.
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.380]   If they want to, you know, increase all their stuff, right?
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.380]   Absolutely.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.820]   For example, even if you have, let's say you have an old hill capsule from
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:30.220]   whenever, you know, yeah, I've got the first one, maybe remove the spheres
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.140]   before you do it.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:31.540]   Right.
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:31.580]   Right.
[00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:37.740]   Put the capsule inside, you know, just like a minute and a half or a minute.
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:42.380]   This is totally fine, then maybe also put the spheres in just separately.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:46.340]   And same thing there, minute, minute and a half.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:50.300]   And then you will have really an amped up hill capsule.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:54.180]   You will still have the frequencies, but the vibration will be ever so higher.
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.180]   So, um, well, you just hit on a really good thing.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:59.980]   I forgot to write down as a question.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.340]   So let me just clarify, right?
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:10.980]   In terms of timing, are you saying treat the boosted infinity block with from a
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.660]   timing perspective, the same as you would a grand block, right?
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.620]   Because what you just quoted are the grand block times, right?
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.140]   Yeah, I would just look on the chart that way.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:21.500]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:26.580]   Treat it that way and definitely not longer rather a little bit shorter, but, uh, yeah,
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.660]   you can, you can use it based on that.
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:33.860]   So we got up, okay, we're going to update our charts for timing, uh, but just as a
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:38.860]   heads up, everybody, uh, once you boost your block, your infinity block, uh, follow
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:42.260]   the grand block timing guides when you're using it for stuff.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:42.740]   Okay.
[00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:47.860]   Uh, so question number seven, if I were to put another capsule in a boosted
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:52.220]   IB one such as a heel, does that upgrade the capsule to 27?
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:53.780]   I think you kind of touched on that.
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.540]   And the answer is no, right?
[00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.260]   It's, it doesn't work that way, right?
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:32:59.660]   Correct.
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.220]   Okay.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:05.100]   So even though the boot, the block is 2700, what I put in the block does not
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.020]   become 2700.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.780]   Is there any guess as to what it becomes?
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.660]   Or does there, are we talking about apples and oranges?
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.260]   And there's just, it's, it's not a relevant question.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.540]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.260]   To us, it's not a relevant question.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:18.580]   All right.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.500]   So I'm sorry it is for others, but, uh, yeah.
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.020]   Yeah.
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.260]   Okay.
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.300]   So, uh, okay.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:28.940]   So the answer to that is new, um, and then, or, you know, we, it gets
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:29.340]   stronger.
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.300]   We don't, we don't, we don't know the number.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.100]   Uh, can we assume anything charges taking on the twin?
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.540]   No, no, no, it doesn't.
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.940]   Uh, and what a charged item from a boosted IB one in a T.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:39.660]   Oh, here's a good one.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:43.820]   You know, you're always telling us don't take something from a higher block
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.980]   and put it in the cube block, right?
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:49.220]   Cause then it'll, it'll upgrade, you know, it'll boost up the cube block.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.980]   So is that the same?
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.780]   You wouldn't want to take something.
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.740]   Let's say I charge something in my boosted infinity block.
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.740]   Should I not put it in my grand block or my travel block?
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.860]   Right.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.140]   In other words, don't keep them separate, right?
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.020]   Cause it's, that's what I would do.
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:05.300]   Yeah.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:10.220]   But the grand block is really not to be, sorry, the quantum block is not to be
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:15.500]   messed with, right, you know, because as long as you want to use it for specific
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:20.860]   frequency transfers and to harmonize pharmaceuticals really, you know, that's,
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:25.940]   that's, yeah, not what we want to do with another version of it.
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:26.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:31.060]   Yeah, I, I got my QB and it's own little room protected.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.940]   I only do frequency copies.
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:35.260]   Yeah.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.780]   I protect my little QB boy.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:37.860]   I think it's worth a lot to me.
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:38.460]   Okay.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:43.340]   So number eight, um, is there a generation of infinity block that is too high
[00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.900]   that can damage the capsule, or I guess would be vice versa.
[00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.740]   You kind of touched on this.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:49.700]   So yeah.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:53.780]   So there, there's no way you can damage anything, but you just don't know what
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.540]   happens after like I be 18, 20, whatever.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.540]   Okay.
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.180]   Uh, so number, no, what definitely happens, it's, it still will upgrade.
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.740]   It will upload these latest features.
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.620]   It'll harmonize the whole thing.
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.020]   The energy will be way smoother afterwards.
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:15.460]   And, uh, yeah, at this point, we're assuming that it will also be a 2,700 on
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.900]   the Hawkins scale after, no matter which level.
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:18.580]   Okay.
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:18.980]   All right.
[00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.540]   Uh, okay.
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:24.980]   So somewhere along the lines of I keep upgrading my IBs, like there's one
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.380]   gentleman, I think he's at 14, 15 right now.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:32.580]   Um, so let's say he eventually gets, or let's say the guy that's at IB 20.
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:38.260]   Um, he puts, if he puts the booster capsule inside of his IB 20, uh, it's
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:42.380]   going to go up to 20, even if it's, let's say his IB 20 stronger than the booster
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:46.860]   capsule, the booster capsule will still give his IB, the harmony and buffering
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:47.500]   feature, right?
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.820]   And correct.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:49.300]   Okay.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:49.500]   All right.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:50.620]   So you still benefit from it.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:50.900]   Okay.
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:51.740]   All right.
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.060]   I don't, there's not, there's like, you're right.
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:56.820]   There's like 0.05% of us have gotten that high, but that's, that's good to know.
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:57.460]   Okay.
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:02.900]   So, um, now number nine, if I upgrade a boosted IB, all right, this is after
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.620]   I boosted it and I upgrade it.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:06.820]   Does it keep the buffer feature?
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.500]   It's permanent, right?
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.380]   The, the buffer features are perfect.
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:11.460]   Okay, I don't go with it.
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:11.940]   All right.
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.020]   So you just, yeah, it just stays with it from that point forward.
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:14.300]   Okay.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.740]   Um, now number 10, after I boost an IB two.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:23.700]   If I put the capsule inside, can I use the charged capsule to upgrade the other IB?
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.100]   Yeah.
[00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:24.620]   Of course.
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:24.980]   Right.
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:25.940]   You can use it twice.
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.500]   In fact, you could use it as many IBs that you have.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:28.820]   Right.
[00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.460]   And that is correct.
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:30.660]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:30.820]   Okay.
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.060]   So no detriment.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:32.300]   Okay.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.460]   Number 11, is it safe to put a boosted IB?
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:35.740]   Okay.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.100]   We got, we covered that already.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.700]   Um, no, it's not safe.
[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:43.140]   If you put something in a boosted IB, don't put it in your TV or your grand block.
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:48.220]   Um, unless I guess you could upgrade your TB and upgrade your grand block.
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:50.060]   With the new boosted IB, right?
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:55.380]   And at that point, would it be safe to, to do that, to put it in there?
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:37:05.220]   Well, the, the grand block, um, yeah, I don't think you know, you cannot really
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.540]   upgrade the grand block.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.060]   Oh, it's not possible.
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.780]   So it's wise and strength wise.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.820]   All right.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.220]   So good.
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:12.980]   I'm glad I asked.
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:13.260]   Okay.
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:17.940]   So there's differences, you know, also in between the blocks that have
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.740]   six blades versus two plates and all of that.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.460]   Okay.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:27.260]   Like, let's say you, if you have two grand blocks, right, or two travel blocks,
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.300]   you couldn't upgrade one with the other.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.500]   It's just, it's just simply not possible.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.220]   Okay.
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:37.300]   I'm going to have to update all my, my tables and run them by you for everybody.
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:41.340]   There's a lot, there's so many scenarios now, right?
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:41.900]   Okay.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:42.140]   Okay.
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:42.740]   So, yeah.
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:42.900]   Okay.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.700]   So in other words, don't mess with your other blocks.
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.940]   Keep your stuff separate.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.140]   Um, yeah, it's amazing to pull up.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.060]   Honestly, it's amazing how many people have multiple blocks.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.700]   I thought I was the only weird one.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:58.180]   And of course you know, but there's so many people that are just enjoying and
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.340]   have gotten so much out of this, that they're just buying a lot of different
[00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.220]   blocks where all these different, and what I got, like, I have one in my car,
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.060]   my truck, you know, got one in the daughter side, you know, so I've got all
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.100]   these, but yeah, it seems like a lot of people have done the same thing.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.060]   Then it just shows that how amazing these products are.
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:18.900]   Uh, okay, so number 12, can I boost an infinity block twice and it increased
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:21.300]   the higher, the level higher than 2,700?
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.180]   Can I boost?
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:26.100]   Can I, you know, can I boost?
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.300]   No, I can go above 27.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:34.020]   No, it's not possible as you can even leave the capsule in there for seven days.
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.460]   And it's not going to do anything.
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.380]   Okay.
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:36.980]   All right.
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:37.420]   Good to know.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.020]   Okay.
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:43.300]   Now number 13 from other conversations about upgraded infinity blocks.
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.060]   Each generation has its own character, right?
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.540]   So this came from this morning.
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:54.380]   And so the idea here was a couple of years ago, you and I had a Q and A where I was
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.740]   asking you about the different generations.
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:02.540]   And you said that there's generations, as you go higher and higher, each one has a
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:05.940]   character, like one's like really conducive towards healing, right?
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.420]   Was what I think was an IB four.
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:11.780]   And then you said you hadn't checked, you hadn't tested all of them, but you
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:17.300]   knew that every time you upgrade to a generation, the reason to recommend the
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:22.220]   people would just, you know, acclimate to that for a few months was it has its own
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.900]   character and it gives your body and your environment time to acclimate to the
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.700]   higher energy.
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:31.500]   But the character of the, of that generation was what you might resonate best
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.100]   with and you might even want to stay with that and stop, right?
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.260]   Not upgrade any further.
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.700]   So there's this idea of character per generation.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:44.180]   So the question is, is if they boosted, are they going to, you know, they kind of
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:46.100]   leapfrog past all of that stuff?
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:51.900]   So I guess the question is, um, every, every upgrade, every generation has a
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:52.900]   character to it.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.540]   Um, and it's wise to bond with that before the next upgrade.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.860]   So if that's the case, and I agree, I think that's still the case, correct.
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.980]   I mean, are you still holding to that?
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.260]   Okay.
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.220]   So every level has a character.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:10.020]   So that if that's the case, the question is, would we be missing out on certain
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:15.300]   characters and learnings if we jump straight to 2700 with the capsule upgrade?
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.100]   Short cut.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:22.020]   Well, it's a good question, but the answer is no, you're not missing out on, uh, on
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:27.500]   anything, uh, especially because at some point, really the infinity blocks in the
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:33.980]   old version, um, as you get higher and higher, the energy would just get, it's not
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:40.060]   smooth enough for those high levels for most people that you really don't need
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:44.780]   to have an IB 25 in the old version.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:45.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:51.460]   It's just way more beneficial for your whole system and being, uh, to have all
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:52.420]   these new features.
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.260]   So there's, there's definitely no missing out on anything.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.420]   Okay.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:41:01.740]   So, so it's sort of like, um, every generation has a character, but if I
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.700]   boost it, I get something that includes them all.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:09.300]   I kind of, I guess I, it's my way of thinking is that what I, what I boost to,
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:09.980]   right?
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:10.700]   Yeah.
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:15.140]   So, so of everything I could experience.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.460]   So exactly.
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:23.620]   So this new infinity block, whether it's at the 3,800 level or the IB on the
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:33.740]   2,700, um, it will surpass everything, every other infinity block.
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:42.100]   Uh, and basically whatever character or aspects, any of those predominantly
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.660]   carried, this one will carry that too.
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:46.540]   Um, yeah.
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.220]   So there's, there's really nothing you're missing out.
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:50.260]   Okay.
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:51.980]   Opposite is the case I would say.
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:52.980]   Oh, okay.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:53.380]   All right.
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:53.660]   Cool.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:58.700]   And so that applies also to if I bought a brand new infinity block today, like,
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:05.060]   let's call it version three, um, and it's at 3,800 because I go straight to 3,800.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:06.940]   And I start upgrading from that point.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.060]   Um, I'm not missing out on anything.
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:14.540]   If I would have just done it the old way with the older, like the, the, not as strong ones.
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:21.820]   You know, as this maybe a level of perspective, you know,
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:25.940]   from my perspective, you know, one is missing out.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:31.700]   I think if someone is completely new to this, uh, you know, and you're jumping right
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.100]   into the 3,800, that's quite a lot.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:35.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:41.300]   You're not initially missing out, but you're jumping into, uh, a deep sea and
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.700]   ocean of quantum energy.
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:48.540]   And you know, there's, there's, there's going to be some stuff to be unpacked then.
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:52.300]   But you know that it is what it is, you know, it's out there now.
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:56.620]   So we, we know we have, there are people that are new to this and they're, they're
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.260]   buying a new infinity block.
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:03.940]   But, uh, you know, that's also how it works is, you know, no one will get this.
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.940]   That isn't meant to have one.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:06.660]   So.
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:07.980]   Okay.
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:08.500]   Great.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.060]   Okay.
[00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:09.860]   So now, okay.
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:15.340]   So now that wraps up the questions, um, that I have for, uh, from the telegram group
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.420]   about the booster, right?
[00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:20.700]   So I'm just going to wrap up this video by saying, Hey, thank you, Phil, for your time.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.020]   Thanks everybody for watching.
[00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:26.700]   Uh, if you want to learn more about quantum, a little quantum tech myself and you can
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.620]   talk to us on telegram, mahalo.
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:29.300]   Thank you very much.
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.060]   We're going to jump into the next video now.
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.220]   All right.
