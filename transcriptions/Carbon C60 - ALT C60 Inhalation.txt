[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another video by me camera and in this video a carbon 60 video. Yes
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.920]   I know I haven't done one of these for a while
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.200]   I'd like to talk to you about
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.000]   alternative C 60
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.800]   Inhalation and yes, I mean actually breathing in C 60 as an alternative way of taking C 60
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.520]   However, before I jump into that, let me just go over some disclosures, you know the disclaimers
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.960]   Same thing. This material is for research purposes only C 60 oil is not approved for consumption by the FDA
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.360]   You understand that making and consuming C 60 oil is experimental and you do so at your own risk
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.520]   And I just want to let everybody know like I always do that
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:49.200]   I do not have a stake in a C 60 company or product and nor do I get paid in any way for making videos
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.440]   But I will be talking about a product today and I and I wanted you to to get a take a look at it now
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.400]   Alternative alt C 60. What do I mean by that? Well, it's just simply alternative
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.080]   You know right now the mainstay that everyone has been following since the rat study in 2012 was you know
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.520]   Let's mix C 60 with olive oil and make it bio available and it's called lipo
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.960]   Fullerine because you create liposomes
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.440]   And that's how you people have been taking C 60 since
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.000]   2012 literally the first commercial product for C 60 oil was released three months after that report came out
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.120]   so for the last I don't know it's 2020 now seven years eight years now people have been taking C 60 oil and
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.200]   That is the main way people take it
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.000]   It's the main way that it's sold if you actually now at this stage in the game if you were to type in C 60
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.120]   Into any search engine and you hit you know search you're gonna get
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.080]   Just tons and tons and tons of links to different C 60 oil products same thing on Amazon so forth
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.600]   So the mainstay for for taking C 60 as a supplement has always been as a lipo full ring
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.080]   And when I say always I'm talking about the universe of time in which it's been a supplement for people to take and you know
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.880]   But again, it's not FDA approved and you know it's still experimental all right
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.320]   But you know there are alternatives and since 2012 till now
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.200]   There have been alternative ways to actually take C 60 because of its many different benefits
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.960]   to our bodies and and and some of these innovative people have discovered and
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.520]   Developed ways in which we can also take C 60 in different ways instead of just taking it in oil
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.520]   And so the very first one that I will kind of worked on and I've actually made three videos about this and I will link to the most recent one
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.360]   in the description below is the topical application of C 60 putting C 60 oil in a
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.440]   Collotion or a cream and then putting that on your skin
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.920]   Will then deliver C 60 direct directly into your skin into the dermal layer of your body. It helps reduce radical oxygen
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.140]   Damage to your skin. It's it's quite protective from a
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.120]   Radiation standpoint as well, you know from UV type of radiation so take it taking
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:15.760]   C 60 topically in creams and lotions in even and you know and actually even taking C 60 oil itself that you would normally
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.120]   You know drink and putting that on your skin is actually really good for your skin
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.640]   So now that was one of the first things that was developed alongside of C 60 oil actually taking it in
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.440]   In fact, if you look at the history of topical applications that actually precedes
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.760]   the period of time where people were mixing it with olive oil and drinking it the topical application of C 60 actually started
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:47.280]   With a Japanese company and they started I think about five or six years before that 2012 study was released in the study
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.280]   I refer to as the famous body rat study
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:57.640]   So topical C 60s been on the commercial market for much longer than actually oil drinking oil and it's actually quite effective
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.680]   Now my last video was a product review where I took several different products and reviewed those
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:11.080]   Topical products that had C 60 in them all of them were great that the ones that I tried and sampled and you know
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.360]   So if you want to learn more about that, you know, feel free to take a look at that video
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.860]   Again in the link description below, but this video what I wanted to do is talk about inhalation now
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.920]   I had to take kind of this weird break
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.080]   But lat but you know what happened this spring, you know happened to all of us
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.160]   So I kind of got sidetracked making different videos about other things right specifically related to the situation at hand
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.380]   And trying to help people and and one of those videos that I made
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.380]   I slapped it together overnight
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:49.520]   And and really what it was was I was working on this alt C 60 inhalation video and this other idea occurred to me that it would be applicable
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.440]   As a what I call the pandemic tink so now this video is and I you know
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.240]   I'm sorry if you've seen it before but I'm republishing this video because I wanted
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.440]   This is what my original intention was was to create a three part series on alternative C 60
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:14.560]   One topical to inhalation and how do you expose yourself to C 60 as a frequency and there are commercial products for that
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.500]   For all you know for all of these three things there are commercial products for that
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.020]   So it's an actual product and people are selling it and people are using it and doing it and so forth
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.300]   So I was working on the inhalation one
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.500]   And I actually because I was working on this whole pandemic thing in the spring
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:37.740]   I shoved it into that video and it's entitled pandemic tinks now for people who are just purely interested in C 60
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.840]   Why I'm put publishing it now. I'm just republishing that video of
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.700]   This product called the breathe easier by live longer labs and that's my unboxing and then kind of explaining how it works
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.360]   I just because I wanted to share it with you and I wanted to grab the attention of the C 60 community in case
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.700]   You missed that other video, which I would assume you would you know because it's it was entitled pandemic tinks
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.700]   You wouldn't think to look for C 60 information in a video called pandemic tinks, right?
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.220]   So that's why I'm publishing it now with the with the proper title so that people understand
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.260]   Oh, hey, here's a video about C 60
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.760]   Annihilation and the product I will be talking about is the live longer labs breathe easier
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:25.500]   Oil atomizer and so I'm gonna basically play that section of the pandemic tinks video now
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.060]   And then explains everything about it
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.580]   And I just wanted to share this with you because you know
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.780]   It was very innovative and and before I switch over to the next video. I do want to say
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.940]   That it's you know, it's been like six months since I made that video
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.540]   And I have been using that device for six months and I will say that I'm asthmatic
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.820]   And I also say that I've got this habit good or bad
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:56.100]   I enjoy cigars a lot and as if you'd ever noticed my avatar that pretty much looks just like me
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.540]   And so I enjoy cigars and I'm asthmatic so like, you know, I'm always getting scolded by
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:09.140]   You know anyone that knows me about that situation and I'm always rather congested because of you know my habit. However
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:17.220]   Six months from I honestly I run the atomizer and I'll tell you that there's a pronicon the con is
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.020]   You know, I I like to have fans on I live in Hawaii
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:26.220]   It's hot all the time so I have fans on of the ceiling fan running and I'll tell you that if you run an atomizer
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.860]   With any wind at all in your room
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.660]   You're not really gonna get the effect of it because the thing just you know
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.860]   It's basically invisible and it just you only can tell it's running when you can smell it
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.860]   But so what I try to do and it's kind of like this stupid thing work
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.740]   I kind of get up really close and put a towel over my head, you know
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.460]   Like like in the old days when your mom made you hold your head over a bowl of steaming water
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:52.440]   Yeah, and so I kind of do that it you know, it's stupid, but I will breathe in the C60
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:59.060]   Oil through the atomizer and it's been six months and my testimony is this it works
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:04.540]   Awesome in terms of keeping me decongested from a lung standpoint
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.860]   Because normally I'm a little Flemmy maybe TMI, but I'm a little Flemmy normally
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.740]   But ever since I've been breathing in using the C60 breathe easier
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.540]   You know, I actually am a lot less
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.700]   Congestion and I don't do that coughing thing, you know if you're asthmatic, you know that what I mean, you know
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:29.780]   We're always coughing but the coughing is is down significantly and I am able to
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.340]   Process my Flemmy
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.020]   Way faster, and I'm actually less congested
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:41.540]   And so, you know, I mean, I mean it's the worst habit you could have is because semi-smoker and having asthma, you know
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:46.660]   But but I'll tell you what it's it's it's actually really helped me. So that's my testimony
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.980]   There you go because when I recorded the video I recorded it the day
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.180]   I got the device so I didn't have anything to share with you
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.580]   But that's what I wanted to share that I personally, you know, and I don't get anything out of it
[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:03.220]   But I personally think that this thing's a great idea and you know like I say in the video coming up
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.820]   It's not you don't have to actually buy that one, you know
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.780]   The whole thing about tinking is you can tink your way to this thing and and here's a tip
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.540]   When I first did that video, I had actually bought the the device
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.060]   It was like 200 something bucks, you know
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:23.700]   With the oil and the device and then I discovered after the fact that you could go on Amazon and just buy the device and use
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.580]   Your own C60 oil because a lot of you who watch my video make your own C60 oil, right?
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:33.980]   So I'm like, oh, okay. Well, I wish I would have known that because then I could have just got by with like a hundred and twenty nine
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:39.100]   Dollars just to buy the device, but then what happened was and this is something you might want to think about
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.260]   I put the device in my Amazon cart and I kind of forgot about it because I already own one, right?
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.800]   And then all of a sudden I got an offer from Amazon through Woot you know WOT
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.900]   And they had them on sale for like 70 bucks or something like that
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:56.540]   And I scooped one up and I you know, I bought it for a friend and I was like wow
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.660]   So, you know, it was one it was one twenty nine retail, but I got one for like 70 bucks
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:08.220]   So you can buy these atomizers relatively inexpensively and you can combine that with your own C60 oil
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:14.940]   And then you can do alt C60 inhalation yourself. All right. Anyway, so let's go ahead and jump into the video
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.420]   This is my unboxing of the C60 breathe easier product
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.940]   And I just gave you my six-month testimonial and I hope you enjoy the video
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:28.900]   Let's talk about lung health. Now interestingly enough in the last week or so
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:35.700]   Sarah Westall had on they had the folks from live longer labs again if you see 60 folks know about live longer labs
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.700]   They're you know a company out there
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.740]   That sells C60 products and this is Phil Cathy Liano
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.580]   And so anyway, so then and his in his in his in his partners there
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.940]   And so she was interviewing these guys about
[00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.380]   About coronavirus and all the things that are going on
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:56.460]   And then they started getting off and talking about a new product that live longer labs came up with and you know
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.020]   Live longer labs guys are one of the C60 producers that are like master tinker's
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:09.220]   They're they're way up there like with Ian Mitchell and and other individuals like Martin and Redline these people who think they they are
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:14.020]   Out there always creating something new and and trying to figure out what's a better way
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:19.020]   What's and and so it's amazing. So there's a link to this video start at the 14 minute mark
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.700]   And what he what they talk about at the 14 minute mark is their new
[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.620]   Product when what they've got is called the C60 complete breathe
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:32.180]   Easier nasal inhalant and and really what it is. It's basically an oil atomizer
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.780]   If this is a standard one you can just get right on Amazon if you want for 129
[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:42.860]   But the but the key is is that they're making they're taking an existing product. That's an atomizer and then you would pour
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.780]   I'll show you in a second. I'm gonna do an unboxing for you, but you would pour
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:51.220]   Their C60 oil into the atomizer, and then you would then just set that thing off now
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.100]   You don't stick here
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.020]   You don't stick it up your nose
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.820]   You just sit it on the counter and you can set this thing and it just runs and then it in the room
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.980]   And then you're breathing the air in the room now
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:06.900]   What's really cool about this if you watch this video and I encourage you to do so from the standpoint of here is an incredibly new thing now
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:12.220]   Here's live longer labs is tested and then produced and then put out a product for
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.560]   Breathing C60 oil check that out. Okay. That is a that is the newest
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.100]   Only guys doing this. This is the first time ever this products
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.600]   I don't know how long it's been on the market, but boom
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:31.140]   This is the first time that people are literally breathing in atomize C60 oil and then what's cool is if you listen to this video
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:36.520]   They talk about their trials and their trials are are informal
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.160]   But they've done several different people who have asthma who have lung problems
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.140]   And when they they were exposed to atomize C60 inhalation
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:53.560]   Their problems their their recovery times from from issues that they had were were halved and in half
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.480]   They they actually could breathe better the asthmatics could breathe better
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.760]   Etc the incredible ability of C60 to be a super antioxidant
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:09.700]   Seems to work extremely well as an inhalant, which is amazing that these guys came up with this
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:14.180]   I mean, you know, it's like I just the whole tinking aspect of this is fantastic
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:18.960]   So this is a product. It's on the market. These guys have tested. They're selling this device now
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.680]   And so I just I got one obviously and so I'm gonna do an unboxing here
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.840]   I want to just kind of show you what it's all about and I just got it today
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.440]   So I've been just kind of playing with this thing
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.960]   It's been running for on my desk for about an hour or so. So this is the box that it comes in
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.420]   I actually bought if you go to the website
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:41.500]   This is their website link in the description and this is what the device looks like now. It comes with one
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:48.880]   Bottle, it's a half ounce bottle of their C60 oil. Okay. Now if you are making your own
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:55.400]   C60 oil then all you do is take your C60 oil and you filter it through a
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:01.360]   Point to - micron filter and you can stick it in this machine. All right, that's all they've done
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.780]   The only difference now would be they've added Kirkman to their product. That's the only difference
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:12.100]   There are C60 oil has been run through a 0.22 micron filter if you listen to the interview and
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:19.380]   It contains Kirkman. So if you're making C60 oil at home run it through a 0.22 micron filter and
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.180]   You're good. You just use that
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.700]   I mean the Kirkman is like a plus but it's not you know
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.740]   It's not mandatory here
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:29.620]   But then you can atomize your C60 oil and get it into your lungs and keep your lungs
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.100]   Super super healthy with that incredible anti-oxid and capabilities of C60
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.040]   And if you get a listen to this video man
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:42.460]   And their testimonies and their stories about people who are doing it is just amazing because I'm someone who I just have
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.420]   Lagging issues every now and then as well. So I thought it's pretty cool
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.820]   But this is the research that they did and so again
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:54.100]   This is that little bottle and then here we go and then then you have to buy theirs and if not then that's that's the thing
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.780]   So going back to the unboxing. This is where it came from
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:02.060]   And so I opened the box up here and I bought you know
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:07.820]   It comes with the one half ounce bottle of their C60 oil and I bought two extras
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:12.540]   Just you know just I'm just doing some sampling and testing and I got one for a friend
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.380]   So I'm gonna send that one off to him
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.860]   But so here's the one that it comes with and I got my two extras
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:22.180]   So just note that it only comes with one and that the extra two is I bought those
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.780]   So it's got the warranty card
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:28.740]   But this is really what it is and it's a lot heavier than it you think it weighs about at least a couple pounds
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:33.740]   That thing is not light. So it isn't interesting, but that's really it. This is the unboxing. This is what it comes in
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:38.940]   Inside of this guy is the two little bottles is kind of weird trying to figure out open that box
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:44.900]   And once I get it open then the little two side bottles pop out and then it does so you could actually use it
[00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.620]   With you can use it for other oils as well
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:50.860]   So I put C60 oil in one and then the other one
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.180]   I don't know what I'm gonna do with just out just now
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.980]   Of course, it's got the instruction manual and I'm a man. So of course, I'm not gonna read that
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.780]   That's just ridiculous to read instructions, you know, I'm just gonna plug it in and figure it out. So
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:08.100]   Hey, what can I say? So anyway, so you see these and this is the okay freeze
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.420]   Well freeze right there. So it's got the three dials
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.940]   This is the on and off and then the power output. Okay, so you can just turn it on it clicks and it turns on
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.820]   You turn it all the way up for maximum output and then this is the runtime
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:24.860]   So it's a timer so the maximum you could set it to is 20 minutes and then it's got this rest mode
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.540]   So the whole idea of what's the rest mode is you could set this thing on for 20 minutes?
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:34.300]   And then if you wanted to come back on by itself because this thing's just running in a room like your while you're sleeping or watching TV
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:38.340]   You can set this thing to rep to rest. So you can basically say let's say
[00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:45.940]   Set it to five minutes it runs for five minutes set the rest to five minutes and it stops for five minutes and it runs for five minutes
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:51.740]   Then rest for five minutes and runs for five minutes and rest for five minutes. See where it goes until you use this button to turn it off
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.740]   That's what those buttons are for. Okay, and so
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:59.100]   That's that's really what it looks like and that's what the bottles are and that's how you click it together
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.660]   It really does work and you know and there you go
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:07.780]   And so let me just jump ahead kind of show you here's the C60 bottle and it's a little and by the way
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:13.220]   You know came really solidly packaged. So there's a really good thing. So that's that's the live longer lab C60
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.780]   For the atomizer
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:21.740]   Comes sealed. So that's a good thing and then I just poured that puppy into that little jar right there
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.900]   I see and and the thing is is what you know is that I was kind of checking it out
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.100]   And if you take a look right here, I just check right here
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:29.620]   I'm like wait a minute
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.460]   What do I even need to do this and yes, you have to you have to pour it in
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.740]   I was thinking I could just take this and plug it into that but if you look at the threads, they're different
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:41.420]   So that's why I did that so you can't just use that bottle and plug it in. It's a different threaded bottle
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.380]   So anyway, I poured in there and then once you get it poured in
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:51.220]   Then you're good to go and then you would just go ahead and connect that up to the machine plug it in
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:58.660]   And once you got it plugged in and then I just went ahead and set it. So it does rattle a little bit
[00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.580]   It's it's no worse than your ultrasonic machine
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:07.460]   It just kind of just rattles quietly, but it is something you can hear. So if it's in your bedroom
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.660]   You don't want it next your head that's that loud
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.980]   But it's not so loud that it would keep you awake
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:17.620]   And then the thing that was interesting is you know, this thing's running right now and you can't see any mist coming out of it
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.740]   It's invisible
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.580]   But if you if you kind of like lean up to it, you can smell and it's kind of like a smell
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.460]   I can't really describe it's it's like an essential oil smell
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:31.180]   But it's it's not like any, you know, like the other the normal ones that you smell
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:37.620]   So it's got it's got a smell of some kind of spicy oil, which is weird because it's essentially it's like olive oil
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.940]   Right, but it's it's it's been atomized. So it's got this it's got this interesting weird smell
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.900]   But it's not a bad smell, but you can definitely smell it
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:51.100]   You just can't see it and that's really what it looks like and so that thing is running right next to me right now as I speak
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.400]   And so the whole point of this now is used the incredible
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.460]   Power of C60 to keep your lungs healthy
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:04.260]   Okay, and if you know anyone with that's as manic or you know like hey, you know, like what's coming up
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.700]   You know all the stuff that's going on, you know, this might be a good time
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:13.540]   But you know listen to the video listen to what they said that it does and how much it's helped people and that's why I bought this thing
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:18.660]   Now like I said, I've only used it for a few hours. I don't really have a testimonial to tell you how well it works for me
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:24.420]   I'm going off of what these guys said, but these guys, you know, they're very trusted and reputable and so here you go
