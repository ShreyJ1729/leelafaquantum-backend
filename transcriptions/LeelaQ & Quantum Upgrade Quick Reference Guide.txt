[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   Aloha everyone. This is K. Elmer here and I just wanted to introduce you to the quick reference guide that I finally completed
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.200]   For the Leila Quantum Tech products the Quantum upgrade service and trom easy. This has been a long time coming
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.380]   It's taking quite a long time to put it together
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.240]   And I've spent a few hours with Philip going over it to make sure I've got as much information as accurate as possible
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.600]   So the one thing I do want to let you know about the quick reference guide
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.160]   It covers all of the products it covers all of the services
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.360]   But the thing is you know things keep changing so you want to really kind of pay attention to the version you have
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.280]   This is the April 17th version 2024 and as changes are made to this document
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.920]   We'll try to just do them once every you know few months so that doesn't get too confusing
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.720]   I will post in the telegram chat groups at the the quick reference guide has been updated so that you know
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.840]   That you know whether or not you have the current version
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.680]   So let's just jump into them into the details of the product reference guide
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.000]   So one of the things about it that I kind of want to clarify is there's you know
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.400]   There's always been a little bit of you know confusion as to which block you have and so the way I kind of you know
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.560]   Kind of categorized it is that you know
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.640]   I call it version one which was the original blocks as they were sold when they first released and now in 2024
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.480]   And most recently last year in April. There's a stronger version of the travel block
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.360]   There's a stronger version of the infinity block and of course with the infinity block as well
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.400]   You can also boost an old one and make you know make that stronger
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.000]   So if you take a look at the different columns
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.120]   It's by block and if you want to know which one you have just take a look at when you purchased it
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.480]   And it'll tell you which one you have so that's kind of the idea behind version one and version two blocks
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.640]   Okay, so then the document gets into in terms of the product specifications, you know what it weighs
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.440]   What's what sizes is how big the energy field is all that stuff that you guys have been asking about in the telegram chat group
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.320]   I also get into the capsules the various capsules now. There's six different capsules as opposed to just three
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.360]   So, you know, there's there's more capsules. They're stronger blocks
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.560]   You know, there's a lot of products out there now
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.840]   And so I just really wanted to kind of put all this information in one place and also the cards in terms of the product specifications
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.440]   By card so if you want to know how big it is what it weighs, you know, all that stuff
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.600]   How big the field is you know for everything?
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.720]   It's all right here in this quick reference guy now in terms of charging times again
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.520]   you really want to pay attention to which block you have and then you just look it up here by column and then right here is all the
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.120]   Different things that you would be charging clothing people pets photos and so forth all the different timeframes are here
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.440]   That are by pulled right out of the tutorials and and added it
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.680]   Of course, you've got the charging times for the newer blocks the stronger ones
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.120]   And then you've got the charging times for capsules
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.200]   So there's again six different capsules so depending on which capsule you have here are they're charging times
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.840]   Now remember if you're using a capsule to charge something that means all five spheres are in that capsule and you're using that to charge stuff
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.640]   Okay, so that's different than the five sphere packet thing. Okay, so that's just a capsule with five spheres
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.480]   These are the charging times using those capsules, you know for food, water, so forth and also to you can charge some stuff with cards
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.600]   So here's the information for that now the copying the frequency timeframes are right in here
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.360]   They're broken down by version one different version two blocks. So pay attention to which block you have and here's your charging times
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.280]   Based on the type of block and again
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.840]   Here's where that sphere packet comes in so you can charge stuff with sheer packets
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.360]   And it's usually just ten minutes for everything, but and I kind of just try to keep the
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.040]   You know the way it's organized the same for every single table
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.200]   All right, so there's your charging times based on what device you're trying to use and we get into quantum upgrade
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.600]   And there's a lot a lot of you know product specifics for quantum upgrade. There's a lot of nuances on you know
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.120]   How to set the you know the settings and things but bottom line though is you know basically it's like hey
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.320]   How big's that field size that is being you know the energy is being sent to you and obviously it's you know
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.240]   It's creating a field around you and how big that is
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:01.120]   Again, you know what your ranges are for Hawkins levels and what your ranges are for booster levels as they are now
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.360]   And we get into also - there's questions that always pop up about you know how long do I need to subscribe before I can have you know
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.200]   Before a stronger booster level is unlocked. So here's that table. So kind of an example after 90 days
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.800]   Your booster level to get unlocked you can go up to 1400 for boosters and your daytime level goes up to 1200
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.800]   So this is when you would get those those extra
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.680]   Features unlocked for you depending on how long you've been subscribed and of course those those gifs
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.720]   Subscriptions of the free home subscriptions and information about that. There's actually two
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.480]   So if you have like a u subscription, you'll get a free home after three months and you'll get another free home after nine months
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.280]   You'll get two free gifts or gift subscriptions
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.720]   When you have you know the longer you subscribe and there's the information for that
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.880]   Now we get into the frequencies and this just updated this week because all of the new frequencies
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.680]   I got unlocked for quantum upgrade and then the new animal frequencies
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.380]   So that's all been updated here right now in this chart. So now I broke it into lately frequencies for humans
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.240]   The column here is card. It means that the frequencies available on a card
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.480]   And then QU is obviously the frequencies available in quantum upgrade
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.240]   Some of them have you know the names have changed and I've made some notes there as to what they're called now
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.680]   As opposed to what they used to be called again
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.920]   We got those new frequencies for animals and that's where they live and again
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.480]   We know we have that one frequency for plants now for anybody who wants to know what the descriptions are for each frequency
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.600]   There's two documents. There's one. That's just the frequency the descriptions for frequencies for just the quantum upgrade
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.560]   The ones available on quantum upgrade and then the ones available for cards
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.640]   And these are actual full-on large documents that I've just simply put a link to
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.080]   So that you can go ahead and if you want to know, you know like basically at a glance
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.840]   What are all the different descriptions for all these different frequencies?
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.840]   You can just click on one of these and it'll pop up, you know the document for that
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.680]   So, you know, it was just it was just too big to include in a quote quick reference guide
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.360]   And lastly, there's the trauma easy quick reference
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.600]   So basically just like how long these things run when you turn them on
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.160]   And also because you can charge stuff mostly food and water
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.440]   Then here's the instructions for charging food and water using your trom EZ service on your phone
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:23.040]   So there you go. That is the Leila quantum tech quantum upgrade and trom EZ quick reference guide
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.620]   I know it's 15 pages not really quick, but it covers every possible
[00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.120]   Product and service and and most all of the questions you guys ask
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.440]   I try to put it all in one document and there you go. This is for you. So
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.800]   You know have at it if you got questions about it, you know, if you find a typo
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.000]   I'm sorry this thing was just packed with detail proofread it numerous times
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.480]   And I tried to do the best I could to provide this information for everybody
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.040]   Who can you know you can reference it and get the most out of your investment?
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:02.200]   So yeah, have fun charging and and tinkering around with these products and I hope this guide is helpful for you. Aloha
