[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   Hello everyone, and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me, Kay Almer, and this is a short one
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.880]   I just wanted to share with you the updated pricing guide for C60 products as of October 2018
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.960]   It's been three months since I did one
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.400]   I thought it'd be a really good idea to do it and so let's just jump right in
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.600]   I just wanted to just run it by you and it's available as a PDF in the link below
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.600]   So what we've got now is we've got a lot more sellers if you've tuned in to the last
[00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.020]   Pricing update there's been a quite a number of new sellers
[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:41.040]   So since then and one difference about this pricing guide is that I put all the prices that are increasing in red and any
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.360]   Prices that have decreased are in green. So
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.280]   again, I
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.640]   Break it out by different types of oil. So the pricing guide for C60 olive oil is this sheet right here
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.640]   Which is C60 in olive oil
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.300]   Duh, and so and I've got them listed by the best deal per ounce
[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.300]   So what I do is they all come in different
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.480]   Size bottles, and so what I try to do is just break it down to an apples to apples comparison and list it by
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.780]   The price per ounce, which is whatever the best deal is so if you got to buy
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.620]   10 to get that price that's the quote the best deal and then of course over here there
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.060]   It does not include shipping
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.800]   So, you know, it's it's the only way to kind of do this in apples and apples
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.840]   So, you know for you guys that are shopping for something to try if you've never bought it before
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.760]   You know
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.560]   Here's a good way to looking at it in terms of being able to compare the prices as well as the different bottle sizes
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.280]   So yeah, and as you can see one of the things I want to just point out real quick is that you know
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.520]   There have been like I always take a look at the average of the top 10 from a pricing standpoint
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.440]   And there has been a definite increase in price
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.700]   since July
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.560]   Because four of the top 10 or the lowest 10 I should say
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.420]   Have increased their prices in the last three months and there is one vendor here
[00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.060]   That is actually having a sale and it's been a sale for over a month now
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.620]   And their prices went down so other than that the blue indicates that the prices have remained the same over the last three months
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:16.380]   And so all you got to do is pop up this PDF click on any one of these names and it's gonna pop up the website
[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.700]   So you can go right there and only one I believe is back ordered the rest of these
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.300]   Show that they're they're producing
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.500]   C60 in oil and selling their products. So things looking pretty good there other than the price increase
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.180]   So now in this quarter in the last three months the average price now has gone up to
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.180]   Per ounce has gone up to 1142, which is an 18.1% increase since the prior pricing study three months ago
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.220]   So I've been tracking it for a year now as consumer demand
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.100]   Jumped right in the price went down
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:56.220]   But as you know, there's a shortage of raw materials and and higher demand and so now we're seeing that the price has actually gone up
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.620]   So 18% in three months is pretty staggering actually
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.860]   So, you know if if you're out there looking for bargains, you know
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.300]   This is definitely gonna help you because the prices are going a little bit higher now. That's in olive oil
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.620]   These are all the vendors that sell it in olive oil. Oh one interesting thing that I do want to point out
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.420]   That's unique to the market just from a pure market, you know competitive analysis
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.020]   But it's interesting that how the vendors are trying to differentiate themselves
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.420]   And I noticed something for the first time and I might have missed it in the past
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.940]   Which was this one right here that SCS has this you know
[00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.260]   You little unique twist on their olive oil product where they have a cold regular olive oil and then they have this high grade
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.540]   You know better olive oil product that they sell C60 at so they charge a little bit more for the better olive oil
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.300]   Which is interesting because a lot of the other sellers, you know
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.380]   They do shoot for the highest quality olive oil they can find put C60 in it and that's their their regular product
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.380]   So it's interesting that one vendor is kind of angling on the better oil product
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.380]   You know a better olive oil as opposed to regular olive oil and and they've actually got two products here
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.620]   Which is their regular one and then their high-grade oil one, which I just thought that was really interesting and as well
[00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.620]   Oh, and then for you guys in Europe
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.860]   You know I see a question in the in the chat room a lot
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:24.620]   Which is you know how to how do I get C60 oil into Europe because there's a big problem getting it in into Europe from the United States right now
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:32.820]   Because of customs and so I did include red line here is in Ireland C60 Canada
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.620]   sells from Canada and then there's a
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.500]   Vendor here selling from Switzerland. So, you know if you wanted to shop locally in the EU and or in there
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.140]   You know anywhere other than the United States, you know, there you go. Okay, so that's that
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.860]   Let's talk about the C60 and other oils
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.700]   As you know, I have the two main quote other oils, which is coconut and avocado
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.260]   And then you know then you've got these other oils, which are just all over the map here
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.740]   There's a new one. There's someone producing C60 in flax oil now, and then of course PSO means pumpkin seed oil
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.740]   So just to go back up to the coconut oil as you can see everything's blue. There have been almost no
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.500]   Changes except for this one that went up a little
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.580]   Changes in prices over the last three months in coconut oil and avocado
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.940]   The prices look pretty stable. They've actually it looks like, you know, it still remains higher than olive
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.380]   From a price standpoint, but you know, it's still quite affordable
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.460]   But one of the things I do want to point out about these two oils
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.020]   You know you look at the lowest prices are 11 14 and 18 for coconut and you can just see where you know
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.780]   It is a lot pricier
[00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.460]   And that's because these manufacturers are using MCT oil, which is not regular coconut oil
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.580]   It's a derivative of coconut oil, and it's a little bit more expensive if you go on Amazon and you go shopping for MCT oil
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.140]   You're gonna find out. It's like about, you know, twenty five thirty five dollars at a quart
[00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.340]   So it's not cheap, and then that price is reflected in here
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:08.100]   But I do want to point out though because my main mantra is really trying to help everybody
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:14.660]   You know understand C60 learn about C60 try C60 and afford C60 oil
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.100]   And I want to point out that you know what at prices like this
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:25.820]   You know you can make it yourself and and if you prefer the coconut oil you prefer the MCT oil
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.460]   You know I highly encourage you to make it because I want to point out and this is just an example right here
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.340]   And this one equally is as well
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.380]   I mean looking how much money these individuals are charging and you know rightly so these all they're always trying to make a living here
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.380]   but for a quart of
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.580]   MCT oil and
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:51.620]   You want to put C60 in it? I make it all the time and I can buy a quart of MCT oil
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.380]   Like I said for 35 bucks and if you can want to get the really good one
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.340]   It's 50 that's that bulletproof brain octane kind
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.780]   But you know you can for like let's say 50 bucks you get 50 bucks for the best
[00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.820]   You know MCT oil you could find which is a hundred percent caprylic acid bulletproof brain octane
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.220]   If you want to go look for it, and then you can go buy like you know
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.380]   A gram of C60 potter right now, you know
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.500]   You can I don't know it's just kind of all over the map
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.860]   I'll cover that in a second, but you know it's like hundreds. Let's just say a hundred bucks
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:28.340]   Let's just say 200 bucks, okay 200 bucks for the M for the C60 and 50 bucks for the oil
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.700]   And you stir it around for two weeks and boom 250 compared to this
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.860]   So it is such a huge deal to make it yourself if you consume a lot
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.620]   Please, you know, I'm just trying to help people out there, and it's really want to point out
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:48.520]   How much cheaper it is to make it yourself when you start getting into these other, you know designer oils, right?
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.180]   So then you know so that's that so that I just want to point that out and then there's the coconut same price
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.700]   It's stability in avocado as well. There are a few more people selling it
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:03.560]   Then there were before and so I've added those guys as well, and then of course the other oils you've got the sunflower oil
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.140]   hemp oil PSO
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.380]   And so forth
[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.500]   The pumpkin seed in flax, and then it's just kind of all over the map because it's all really different
[00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.500]   So this is the only way I could throw it together
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.700]   It's not really a you know a true comparison because it's very different
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:23.260]   Okay, so that's those guys and then what I want to talk about too is the specialty products
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.260]   And what's really cool is that in the last three months?
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.860]   The company called carbon 60 plus
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:35.380]   Which is run by the same individuals who run live pet have come up with a new product line
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:42.340]   And so I've added that here from a specialty standpoint that new product line is called C 3 60 health revive by the way
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.580]   None of this is a product endorsement. I just just talking about products
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:51.700]   I don't get a share of anything. I don't get paid at all. I'm just you know just sharing what I know so
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.180]   Anyway, this new product line came out with it's interesting
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:09:00.740]   But this is the thing that's cool about this company is that they're the only ones that I've seen and I've read a lot of the websites
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:06.660]   Where they actually are chemists and they have labs and they they experiment like crazy
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.860]   And they've been doing it for over a decade and these scientists have patented a
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:17.700]   Special blend of oils and if you look at one of their labels, it's not it doesn't it's not olive oil
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.980]   It's just a blend of different oils. It's got systemic enzymes in there and other anti-aging
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:29.940]   Supplements mixed in and they've created their own blend and they've actually got a patent on their on their blend
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.700]   And and they've created a blend of oil that's able to hold
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:42.420]   more C60 in it and from in saturation then again than just a regular olive oil the regular, you know like the benchmark amount of
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.940]   C60 that
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:51.340]   Olive oil can hold in it at in dissolved state is 0.8 milligrams per milliliter, right?
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.700]   and
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.940]   But a live pet and C 60 carbon 60 plus
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.740]   They've got a special blend of oils. They've got two products one
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:04.260]   They're able to get the saturation point up to 1.0 milligrams per milliliter
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:10.460]   That's you know, that's a 20% increase right over the standard and then they've got another product that goes 1.2
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.220]   And they've got a patent on this stuff. So it really is interesting
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.180]   And now they've got the three new products from 360 health
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.420]   They've got a hair growth formula
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:26.660]   So if you ever listen to the Sarah Westall interview of I and Mitchell where he talks about they came up with a hair growth
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:33.220]   Formula that works. You can go to their website and check it out. So and so they're selling a C 60 product
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.460]   That's designed for hair growth and it's proven clinical proven in the lab to work
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:42.340]   And then they've got this these other two products and I just got a bottle of the male one
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.260]   They've actually and I haven't talked to I and about like what makes them different
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.940]   And I hope to get some time to do so. He's very busy guy
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.860]   But I wanted to chat with them about they've got a blend just for men and a blend just for women
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:59.620]   And I kind of want to understand like, you know, what's different about it that makes one, you know for male and one for female
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:04.900]   But they've got these two new products plus the hair so it's three new products over at carbon 60 plus really interesting
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:10.540]   I bought a bottle of the revive for men. I haven't had a chance to try yet. It's on my list of things to do
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.660]   So interesting new stuff there since the last pricing
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.860]   Guide came out and then of course you've got the rest of the stuff and then you know again, too
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:23.180]   You know, even though the live pet companion 60 product is for pets it's for mammals
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.820]   And if you're looking for a really, you know, good bargain
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:31.380]   You know, you could try it on your, you know, 200 pound dog that sleeps in your bed every night
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:38.420]   And and save some money and so something to think about. Okay. Anyway, so this is the specialty oils
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.860]   A lot of talking about the irons products over here
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.340]   You've got yes lab and and these other guys and then of course there's carbon 60
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:51.820]   Which is grascus carbon 60, which is a whole another thing and a really interesting product as well and
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:56.860]   There you go. So you've got a couple of guys that are putting CBD oil and stuff like that
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.900]   So then lastly the big news of the day is what's going on with Ross 60
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.940]   So I've updated the pricing guide here where I could find them
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.620]   I went through every single website and also there's a huge discussion on the chat in the chat room
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:14.180]   If you know about our telegram chat room for c60 enthusiasts
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.580]   About you know trying to get the raw 60 a lot of folks are making it for themselves even more so
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:25.220]   Are a number of people who are making it to resell and so you know getting that raw material is really important
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:30.900]   So here's the number one thing you guys should all realize and you you already know it. Okay, look how much red
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.580]   This is all the red is prices going up
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:41.420]   So now the prices are going up in the raw materials and they're all on back order or not or they're not even taking you know
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.020]   Orders so you've got like MTR taking orders, but not responding to email
[00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:50.100]   So, you know that they say you know and nothing against any of these guys there
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.980]   I mean, I'm sure they're just completely overwhelmed
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:58.220]   But you know MTR's process to email them and they give you an invoice and then you pay them and then they process your order
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:04.260]   They're not even responding to emails to order anything and so that's an issue
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.220]   You know so they're backed up obviously and then of course you've got red line
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:14.260]   They are taking back orders and they're they're they're they're right now. There's they're they're they're not committing to a date
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.860]   But it's possibly December that they'll start shipping
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:22.380]   Bucky Labs is saying that they're going to start shipping mid-November according to somebody in the chat room
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:29.580]   Taking back orders at Piers 60 olive oil, but they're not they don't state on their website when they're going to start shipping over there
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:34.820]   This is all about raw C60 by the way not C60 oil, but raw C60 powder
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:40.940]   and then the SES themselves and SES sent out an email about three weeks ago saying that hey, you know
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:45.340]   We're gonna start taking back orders, and we'll resume shipping on November 15
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.620]   So but you know you go to their website. They don't even have the prices posted
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.020]   So I don't even know what their new prices are
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.820]   And so then you've got Solaris Kim. That's the Canadian producer
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.340]   Now you go to their website. They've got this little thing that says hey, you know
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.500]   It's gonna be a one-to-three-month delay. We're sorry
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.100]   If you want to get a bulk order and I'm thinking bulk means
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.780]   You know you make a bunch of it and you sell oil for you know
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:14.540]   And you know not just you know like us homemakers, but and but they're not taking any regular orders from us people
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:19.660]   But they're taking back orders for bulk purchases, and they don't define bulk
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.660]   But I'm assuming it's a lot more than I have
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.420]   And then you've got these other companies that I kind of covered before
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.500]   In prior pricing guides I kind of dropped them in the last one
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:34.700]   But I added them back in so because I just can't get a lot of info for them, but this is
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.060]   Alpha a sir, I guess is
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:45.180]   They're they're not stating if they are if they're taking back orders, but they're advertising a 416 price and they're really low grade
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.180]   too, so I wouldn't even recommend using this for
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.060]   Oil, I mean 99.5, 98.9
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.780]   To me, that's a little low
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:57.180]   As you know, the the remaining up to 100 is just a Morpheus carbon C70 and so forth
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.100]   It's not C60 so you're getting 99.5 percent C60
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.740]   But that other you know 0.5 is something else, and I don't know if you want to even take that it's up to you
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.060]   But here are the prices
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:13.100]   Now you've got american elements they're they you know, they've they've got it listed on the website
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.260]   It doesn't say back-ordered, but it says you got to email them for a quote for pricing
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:22.140]   Cheap tubes is like they're not even taking orders. They're not posting prices
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.620]   They're just you go to their website and it just says out of stock
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:29.980]   Sigma Aldrich said they've got prices out there and they're saying they're gonna start shipping on November 7
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.980]   So that's probably the best bet right now
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:36.620]   But again, it's not the highest quality most of the commercial producers of C60 oil
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:42.380]   Their minimum grade is 99.95 and you can see 99.5 here. So you know, that's up to you
[00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.500]   and then again, there's this other company WWR and
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:51.020]   They're kind of like this thing where you they require business documentation to purchase
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.060]   So I don't even know what that means. I didn't ask them what that documentation
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:16:00.060]   But I'm thinking that these guys down in here only sell to institutions and companies
[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.340]   But I don't know that's just a guess but you know, hey click on the link
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.340]   Go check them out if you're, you know interested in doing that
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:09.260]   So that's the raw 60 pricing guide prices are going up
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.700]   Real cool new stuff happening in specialty oils
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:18.380]   Stability and coconut avocado and new oil oils all the time
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.740]   And then of course you can here's this the benchmark which is C60 and olive oil
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.540]   Some prices are going up
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.180]   Overall the market price has gone up 18% and that's it
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:37.580]   So hey, thank you very much for tuning in and checking out the latest update and the pricing guide and have a great day
