[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and in this video
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:12.160]   I'd like to share with you what are the best oils to use with C60 and so the idea here is that
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.000]   right now in the marketplace if you are buying a C60 oil product to take as a supplement you've
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.560]   got a lot of different choices and different oils that it comes in and so let's take a look at what's
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.480]   out there in the marketplace and then let's talk about healthy versus unhealthy oils right and then
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.240]   at the end of the day you know what's most important when you're buying a C60 oil product
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.560]   and then what's most important is you want to get a healthy oil obviously but the second one is you
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.920]   want to have high solubility and the reason you want to have high solubility is because you're buying
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.240]   C60 you're not buying oil it just has to come in oil and so you want to have an oil that that is
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.240]   really the best C60 you know oil you can find because it's going to have the most amount of C60
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.320]   in the oil you know that it's that's possible and that's kind of the general idea here and so
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.120]   let's kind of you know jump right in and let's talk about this now right off the bat your choices
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.760]   are if you just take a I just did a quick scan like what's out there and you know you come back
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.280]   with all of these different kinds of oils you know almond oil avocado blackseed chamellina CBD hemp
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.120]   MCT etc so there's a bunch of different choices so how does a consumer decide you know what is
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.880]   the best one that I you know what what's the best one and and which one should I be taking
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.680]   which one should I be avoiding and then if you know if you make your own C60 oil same issue right
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.840]   what are you going to mix your C60 oil with and what are your choices and what's good what's bad
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.320]   etc so let's just jump right in you know here's the choices that's what's out there in the market
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.880]   right now but you know really at the end of the day what's the most important thing you know there's
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.520]   two important things right health and solubility so from a health standpoint right now it is a
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.360]   really it's you know loud thunderous you know you know amount of noise is coming out about how
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.000]   bad seed oils are and so that's the one thing that's kind of overwriting in the marketplace right
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.720]   now is everyone's you know switching to butter and lard you know for cooking and and tallow and
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.840]   all of that stuff and ghee and and you know just everyone's you know the health people that are
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.800]   into health are avoiding seed oils and so why and so I got to tell you honestly before I got
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.640]   into this research I didn't know why I just you know took it for face you know for at face value
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.920]   I kept seeing all these different youtube videos and and reels and new name and people I respect
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.320]   you know saying hey you see to all bad don't avoid it I'm like okay you know and I just and
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.800]   I haven't been I don't eat cedos anyways it's been like for decades I've been just using lard and
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.120]   tallow and things like that anyway for and you know just just my own personal preference right
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.440]   I don't trust highly processed anything but you know here's the reason and I'll just give you I'll
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.640]   give it to you real quick this video is not about you know cedos right but the idea here is that
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.440]   the reason cedos are bad and this is what I found out was because of a linoletic acid which is your
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.480]   omega-6 and it's not that acid in particular but it's the amount of olinoletic acid within the oil
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.760]   and that's one of the biggest reasons why people are declaring cedos are bad is because a high
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.880]   concentration of linoletic acid omega-6 will contribute to chronic inflammation which which
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.920]   will then create potential high health risks like cardiovascular disease and other chronic
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.760]   conditions and so there's kind of been this thing out in the marketplace they call it the quote
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.640]   the hateful eight and so the seed oils that are out there on the market that you know all the
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.720]   health pundits are saying don't eat this uh you know like things like you know sunflower oil
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.920]   corn oil canola oil cotton seed oils etc these are all the seed oils that you know the health
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.600]   pundits are saying hey completely you know you should avoid these right and when you take a look
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.680]   these different oils and you look at their linoletic content you know it starts to make sense you
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.320]   got you you know you got some really high ones out there you got like safflower and grapeseed oil
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.160]   there's 71% linoletic acid and if that's the bad part of the of the of the oil and you know and
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.920]   it's 71% that's not a good thing so that's really really bad next up is sunflower oil at 66%
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.240]   corn oil 60% so that is number one is that you know a linoletic acid you know avoid you know
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.040]   avoid if you can of course we need our omega 3s and 6s but not in high quantities and that's what's
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.080]   really kind of jamming a lot of folks up as they take you know as they take uh you know use oils
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.080]   cooking oils and things like that that are really high in this and if you get a diet high in omega
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.280]   6 you got problems and so the other thing too that that really popped out and this is just real
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.360]   you know high level stuff but I just want to point out that the acetos are also bad because
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.720]   they're highly processed they cause oxidative stress which is that inflammation thing uh they're
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.080]   frequently derived from genetically modified seeds uh which you know as we all know is
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.440]   something that all the health people want to avoid and then of course there's this other you
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.680]   know the other studies out there they're showing that are negatively impact male fertility and
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.080]   maternal and fetal health and pregnant women so you know just those four bullet points alone is
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.480]   like hey and then you've got the linoletic acid thing so just keeping in mind that you know because
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.960]   they're highly processed you know they're using petroleum based solvents to extract a seat you
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.880]   know the oils from the seeds and they're also using chemicals to preserve them like BHA and BHT
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.680]   to you know extend the shelf life and so you know it's it's that stuff that you find in a grocery
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.720]   store that are most likely going to be these high processed seed oils which are most likely
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.000]   going to be seed oils you want to avoid and that's kind of what the health pundits are saying so
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.280]   right off the bat when we're talking about what's the best C60 oil you know it's going to be well
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.640]   you and you really need to kind of just take the seed oils off the list right off the bat just
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.280]   take them off the list and so what does that leave you in the marketplace and then options to
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.360]   mix your own C60 with well at this point then you know you're looking at okay well what are the
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.640]   other possibilities well you've got avocado MCT and olive oil because it comes from the flesh of
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.800]   the fruit and it doesn't come from the seeds okay so that's just a no-brainer right there
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.720]   and the little point that I want to make about CBD oil is that CBD comes from you know the you know
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.400]   a hemp plant right and it's basically an isolate that they mix in a carrier oil so you don't know
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:07.200]   unless you ask like what is the carrier oil of the CBD product because it could be any one of these
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.840]   oils so you don't really know so it's really kind of like take it off the list until you know
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.880]   what it's made with and I make my own CBD oil and I use avocado oil so just kind of give you an
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.440]   example you can make CBD oil with any oil okay so it really is kind of like even though it's a
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.840]   choice out there in the marketplace you really need to go hey what oil did you guys use you know
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.480]   when you're selecting your oil so right off the bat let's talk about you know hey well that's what's
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.960]   out there and you know if you start really kind of getting serious about your health you're taking
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.720]   a supplement called C60 it's not cheap well you want to pick the right oil but there's a catch
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.200]   and they're what's really interesting about this is I was chatting with Bob Gresca from Gresca's
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:51.120]   Carbon 60 now this is one of the longest established C60 companies that we have here in the United
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.720]   States he's been selling from you know from weight you know anyway just from from the beginning the
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:05.120]   beginning meaning rat study days and so the idea here was that you know Bob's flagship product comes
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.400]   in sunflower oil so I kind of wanted to go hey you know and I wanted to reach out to him and kind
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.480]   of just talk to him about that and it turns out when I reached out to him that he's actually been
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.760]   addressing the bad seed oil problem because his product you know it's got sunflower oil and people
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.400]   are avoiding it now and so the thing was that's interesting is that Bob kind of approached
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.200]   this challenge from a couple of different ways and come to find out the sunflower oil he's using
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.400]   is not a bad version which I didn't even realize that there was such a thing as a good and a bad
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.040]   seed oil so anyway so I had a really quick chat with Bob yesterday and I wanted to share that with
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:45.200]   you to kind of get his perspective on the idea and the concept of bad versus good seed oils and
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.400]   then what his company itself you know and he's done with his products to kind of address that
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.120]   whole healthy versus unhealthy oil so let's bring Bob on and and we'll move from there all right
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.840]   well hey everybody I got Bob Greska from Greska's Carbon 60 on the line I just wanted to chat with
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.040]   him because he and I were kind of passing text messages back and forth a few weeks ago about
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:11.840]   seed oils and so Bob's done some really great research on good versus bad seed oils and that
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.320]   they're not all bad and so Bob I just you know thanks for you know joining me and
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.800]   and just kind of wanted to get your take on what your research shows because you know I know that
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.880]   you know for the longest time your product is carbon 60 and sunflower oil and so now obviously
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.280]   because it's seed oil people are starting to get worried because it's such a big health thing now
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.880]   you know about seed oils so I just thought you know if you could just kind of share with me
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:41.040]   like what is your research found and what are you know what's carbon what's Greska's carbon 60
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.200]   you know how are you addressing that those concerns in the marketplace about seed oils
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:51.680]   well we addressed them two different ways well one is trying to educate people it's not
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:58.800]   yes it's true most seed oils are bad because they have a high omega-6 content but sunflower oil
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:05.280]   there's two types of sunflower oils one with a low omega-6 and one with a high omega-6 now 85 percent
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.960]   omega-6 and a sunflower oil is not good for you and that's what most of the seed oils are out there
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.400]   the sunflower seed oil is but the one we particularly chose to deal with and work with and put in our
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:22.720]   product is Hane Celestial which has a very low omega-6 content it's lower than your olive oil
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.680]   it's lower than your avocado oil it's down around six percent plus a minus of prints
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.640]   one percent somewhere in that ballpark around six percent whereas your avocado oil and your
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:41.280]   olive oil they're about 10 to 15 percent omega-6 so actually the you know sunflower oil with the
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:49.040]   lower omega-6 it actually has a high omega-9 which is the oleic acid where omega-6 is linoleic acid
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:54.960]   so a high omega-9 sunflower oil is actually very heart healthy for you so that's why we chose
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.520]   it and that's what we do it and then the other approach we're doing is we you know due to popular
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.000]   perception public perception you know we can't change it because everybody says seed oil is a bad
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.880]   seed oil is a bad and they look as they're all seed oil is a bad well you know unless it's a
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:15.520]   linoleic acid the omega-6 is bad in it so so we introduced you can't change public perception
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:21.200]   too easily so we introduced carbon-60 in an olive oil we found a good olive oil that we like and
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:30.320]   but but olive oil always comes in a brown bottle as you see it in a store and sunflower oil comes
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.360]   in a clear plastic bottle well that's because the olive oil is subject to sunlight degradation
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:41.840]   with the sunflower oil is not so it has a sunflower has a longer shelf life it has zero taste compared
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:47.760]   to you know the peppery burn taste that you get with the you know high quality olive oils and we
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.240]   have that in our olive oil too there's a little peppery burn taste to it in the back of your throat
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.840]   but that's subject to the the olive oil so that's just the way good olive oil is this has a high
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:03.520]   polyphenol content so so we have a choice on our website either olive oil or sunflower oil so
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.880]   you know take your choice but we we i i prefer the sun the sunflower oil by far because it has a
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:16.320]   longer shelf life no taste um and it's got a very it's got a lower omega-6 count okay you know so
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.080]   awesome that so you've got a brand new product now just kind of you know put people at ease if
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.520]   they you know they get they get a choice now right so awesome on the new product
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:29.440]   great and then but the question i've got though is you know for your sunflower product you know
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:36.720]   how do you or how do they you know produce a sunflower oil that's low in omega-6 and and you have
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.200]   like you know if people were worried about it you like provide a certification on the oil that you
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.640]   sell that you provide i mean how's that how's that work i mean because to me you know in my research
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.920]   it just showed that anything that was mass-produced seed oils are really bad because they're just
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.320]   the way that they're produced so are you like buying like directly from farms i mean how do you
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:04.080]   do it that you can find a low omega-6 seed oil we buy directly from hinds pain celestial okay and
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:10.560]   they are a big producer of oils but all kinds of oils but though the sunflower seed oil they know
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.880]   they knew way back when that the omega-6 is high and they they've actually seeked out high oleic
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.440]   acid high omega-9 sunflower oil so that's what they produce and that's what we buy from them it's
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:29.760]   organic it's clean comes in a clear bottle and you can see through it so that's we just go with
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:35.520]   their source and i don't i don't know they don't they do not use solvents a lot of these mass-produced
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:41.840]   sunflower seed oils or seed oils they use hexane which is a solvent so we have a totally solvent
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:47.040]   free product we have no solvents in the production of the carbon 60 and no solvents in
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:54.960]   the production of the sunflower oil so it's it's pretty clean okay no that's awesome that's great
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:00.000]   to hear i was i knew that you know you're definitely an exception to the rule because of the painstaking
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.960]   effort you put in getting a quality oil and that i think a lot of people don't even realize
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:11.280]   that there is such a thing as good versus bad seed oil you know well that's true but if you if
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.840]   you read between the lines and read in-depth and do the research it's a linoleic acid which is
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:22.560]   the omega-6 which is the high concentration that makes it the bad seed oil so and we just use one
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:29.680]   with a very low linoleic acid content high oleic acid high omega-9 okay and so when you were looking
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:36.800]   for an olive oil for your olive oil product is it is it you'd mentioned to me earlier that
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:43.120]   you tested several different olive oils and discovered a wide range of the you know the
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:49.520]   content of oleic acid in in the different samples so or i'm just can you comment on that in terms of
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:55.440]   like you know choosing a product that's in olive oil but then how do you know how good of an olive
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:02.000]   oil it is well the good that you can tell by tasting it has that peppery burn in your bed
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.840]   yeah that's applied polyphenol content and you know all the olive oils they're they're 10 to 15
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:14.320]   percent omega-6 so you know they are higher than they're twice you know twice as high as the sun
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:20.320]   flow oil we use okay but but another thing too is you look at the volume of our product versus
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.400]   anybody else's anybody else's carbon-sixty product you're taking two teaspoons without product you
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.520]   only take an an eighth of a teaspoon so you're really getting you know 16 times less of the
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.080]   oil consumption whether you choose the olive oil or the sunflower oil so it's a very little
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:42.640]   very very small amount of you know almost negligible of concern oh yeah oh no that's great because
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.920]   yeah in my opinion you know i look at also you know for the folks that are creating lipo fullerenes
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.120]   you know my whole point is you want to get the highest solubility because you're not you're not
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:58.800]   buying oil you're buying C60 and you want to limit the amount of oil you intake and to get the biggest
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:06.640]   bang for your buck on the C60 itself right so yeah okay so what are your thoughts on solubility in
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:13.440]   terms of like the best oils for well they say that the olive oil is the best solubility which
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:22.400]   a traditional carbon you know electric arc solvent extraction technique which all all carbon-sixty
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.040]   producers use that method they use the carbon arc solvent extraction technique and some people
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.600]   clean it up with a vacuum oven drying some people sublimated to but they still never get all the
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.880]   solvents out when they do that they still have traceable amounts of solvents and so in their
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:42.640]   particles actually when the solvents dry off or evaporated to go away um they all the particles
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.960]   clustered together so they're very large so they get limited solid sorry and I imagine that's
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.520]   why the reason it causes a limited solubility because it can only get so much carbon-60 like
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:59.120]   0.8 grams per liter but you know we don't we don't have a restriction since our particle size is
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:05.840]   much much smaller 200 200 000 times smaller we have actually truly 20 nanometer particle size
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:11.200]   where where all these other processes you have you know 1000 to 2000 nanometer in size so they're
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.920]   much much much larger so we don't have any problem with solubility you know because our particles
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.400]   are so small they go into a what we call a colloidal suspension it's really not a dissolved solution
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:25.920]   it's a colloidal suspension okay please because the smallest of sizes of particles
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:31.280]   yeah definitely a different approach towards C60 oil but definitely works you've got great
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:36.880]   testimonials on your sites and a lot of customers really love your product so yeah that's great I
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.360]   really appreciate your your take on that I just wanted to make sure people were aware
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.880]   that there is such a thing as you know good seed oil but it's just really hard to find you're
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:52.240]   not going to find in a grocery store no no if you want to if you want to find good seed or a sunflower
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:58.240]   oil go get spectrum organic sunflower oil that is made by hane hane celestial okay all right so
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:03.360]   that's the one spectrum that's a good sunflower oil it's it's you know another thing too is
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.200]   you know they're talking people with these oils when they do their testing they're cooking with
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.880]   them they're sort of heating them up at high temperatures which actually changes all the
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:16.400]   property so if you're taking them you're raw or not heated or you know you know just hard to bottle
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.240]   you know they're not they're not a problem so when you when you heat them that really causes a lot
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:26.160]   of changes so is that heating is that heating up to and beyond the smoke point or if you keep it
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.200]   lower than the smoke point well the smoke point is most of the smoke oh yeah yeah but you know heating
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.640]   it up to high temperatures like three or four hundred degrees you know smoke points usually
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.760]   like 460 something like that somewhere in that ballpark for most all these plant oils as we call
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:45.360]   them um so they're all in a 460 kind of Fahrenheit temperature range but you know even if you heat
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:51.440]   them up to 300 you're now changing the properties of the of the seed oil itself or or the olive oil
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:57.280]   or the plant oil right so definitely not not to cook with but you can definitely take it with C60
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   in a in a like basically a room temperature right I mean you yeah yeah you store your products at
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.360]   room temperature right is that correct we don't recommend refrigeration because a cycling of the
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.720]   refrigerator that turns on and off every hour let's say uh-huh yeah since we're at a quota suspension
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:19.440]   that drops it out quicker oh okay it still drops out is we're at a quota suspension but it takes a
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.960]   couple years to drop out so you know it's very slow process and it will drop out to a cloud at
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.360]   the bottom of the bottle you know but on bottom third of the bottle it won't drop out to it like a
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:34.960]   crusty layer at the bottom but it drops out to a cloud but that takes a couple years so it's not
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:40.720]   it's such a slow process okay well hey you know appreciate it thanks for providing you know just
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.360]   a little bit of insight I definitely wanted to add that you know add your comment to this video
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.320]   because it's such an important issue for people that are looking for better health and you know
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:56.720]   obviously they're turning towards C60 and knowing what's the best oils to take with C60 or you know
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:02.800]   to use to make their own C60 oil really important topic so thank you very much Bob I really appreciate
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:08.640]   your time very good thanks K well there you go and thank you again Bob for joining me on this video
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.520]   and just sharing your insights is really valuable and appreciate your time but I do want to kind of
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.840]   point out a couple of things that he said you know and and what he did also bring up which I think
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:23.200]   is something that a lot of us don't think about but you know this whole idea behind solvent-free where
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:28.960]   he's really adamant about using solvent-free and so are other companies solvent-free C60
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.120]   but then Bob really introduced another idea here that I don't think anyone that really talks about
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.080]   and that are you getting solvent-free oil you know so it's kind of an important thing because
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:42.560]   we know if we're doing this for our health and everybody if you're worried about solvent-free C60
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:48.880]   might be time to start asking about the solvent-free oil that's being added you know the C60 is being
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:53.840]   added to so there's one thought I want to leave you with and the other thought that I you know I
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:59.200]   realized I forgot to ask Bob about but he did bring up the issue of what container that the
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:04.400]   oil comes in and so he mentioned you know amber bottles and and you know because of the light but
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.560]   one of the things I do want to point out and for those of you who've been you know know is that you
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:14.480]   know plastic bottles are really really not good especially when they contain oil because what's oil
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:20.480]   oil is a combination of fatty acid esters and what are acids well they're going to basically dissolve
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:25.440]   slowly over time they're going to basically you know leach chemicals out of that plastic
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:29.440]   and it ends up in the oil and so you'll if you look into it you'll hear about something called
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:34.960]   folates which is what oil will pull out of the bottles and folates are very toxic to us so
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:40.480]   right off the bat you know you really want to be aware of like what Bob was saying was
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:46.080]   making sure that it's got the oil that you're selecting is low in linoletic acid the omega
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:51.840]   six also you want to make sure that you know it's it's you know organic non-gmo but that also too
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.600]   you know that they're getting their oil and what does it come in does it come in you know metal
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:00.960]   tins barrels but if it comes in plastics then you know that's a huge issue that you know because
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.360]   it's sold to you in glass but what did what did they get it in and you know there's actually one
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:12.320]   C60 manufacturer C60 oil manufacturer that's been out there for years and you know they they
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:18.480]   basically promote their product as the best you know the best price C60 out there
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:24.880]   and they tout that they're using Kirkland oil from olive oil from Costco
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.160]   you know and you got to think about that because Kirkland olive oil in Costco comes in plastic
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.040]   bottles and if that's the product they're using and even though you know Costco swears by the fact
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:41.920]   that their olive oil is authentic but it comes in plastic jugs and then that's then turned into a
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.560]   product so there's kind of a lot of homework here you could imagine having to kind of think about
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.960]   in terms of are you getting the healthiest oil you can get when you're buying and or making your
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.400]   C60 product so okay so enough about that let's jump into solubility now one of the things about
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:02.800]   solubility right off the bat is when I went looking for and I did a really deep dive on trying to
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:08.960]   find peer-reviewed you know studies that have touched on the subject of what are the best oils
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:15.120]   to mix with C60 from the standpoint of solubility again going back to the idea that you're out there
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.800]   trying to buy C60 you're not buying oil it comes with C60 and that's why you got to worry about it
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.520]   but really though you want to get an oil that's going to hold the most amount of C60 in it so
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:30.560]   that you know you get the biggest bang for your buck so solubility which is the amount of C60 that
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:36.480]   can dissolve into that oil is a big deal for that very purpose and so now I will let me share with
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:42.320]   you a couple of studies that I did run across I do touch on the subject one of them is in a journal
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:47.440]   called medical chemistry and pharmacological potential of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes it's
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:53.520]   a Springer publication chapter 13 of this book and if you want to read these studies I'll put
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:00.640]   links in the video description below but in chapter 13 the title of that study on page 317 of the book
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:08.320]   of the journal is the titled solubility of fullerenes and fatty acid esters a new way to deliver in
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:14.480]   vivo fullerenes theoretical calculations and experimental results now the way that the biochemists
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:22.080]   in this study approach the idea of what is the best soluble oil for C60 is they did it mathematically
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:28.080]   and so basically what they did was they studied all of the different parameters the fatty ester
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:34.960]   parameters of various oil types and did their calculations based on their known you know calculations
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.360]   for solubility in different fatty acid esters and then they did their math and they came up with
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.720]   this formula and if you read this and if you read the actual study which is what I'm scrolling through
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:50.720]   on the screen you'll see that they did a lot of math they did a lot of studies of C60, C70, C76
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:56.080]   all these different various fullerenes and what their solubility parameters were based on their
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:02.080]   molecular configurations and so forth and they came up with a lot of math and I'm not a biochemist
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.560]   so I you know can't really get into the full you know the actual formulas they came up with but
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.680]   this is the formula that they came up with and then they went and applied that to different oils
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.200]   in terms of calculations so what the study shows this particular study is that it did show and this
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.480]   is what the biochemists are claiming is it is shown that the solubility of fullerenes and
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:28.400]   vegetables can be predicted and justified on the basis of solubility parameters of C60
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:34.480]   and C70 and of the glycol esters of fatty acids and then it also they state it appears that the
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:39.520]   best calculation approach for the prediction of the solubility of fullerenes and free fatty acids
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:45.920]   and in fatty acids derivatives is granted by equations so they were pretty adamant that they
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.640]   had basically figured out and they cracked the code on on basically determining what the best
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:59.600]   soluble oil was for C60 and C70 simply by calculation so when they actually ran the numbers they calculated
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:06.240]   that oil or olive oil was the number one soluble oil that you know you could mix C60 with based on
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:11.520]   the on the calculations that came out with they they basically said in their in their formulas
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:18.880]   they predicted that the max solubility of C60 in olive oil was 909 milligrams per milliliter
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.360]   and the next two that followed that in terms of the high on the high end of the scale was peanut
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:29.600]   and brassica which is rapeseed oil so peanut came in at 751 milligrams per liter and brassica came
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:35.920]   out at 859 so these three out of the seven that they tested were really high in terms of hey these
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:41.600]   are really good oils to use because they can contain a lot of C70 and it also kind of transforms over
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:47.040]   here to C70 if that's your thing so that's a really interesting data point in the discussion
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.840]   was you know these biochemists they did their homework they figured out a formula and they came
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:56.400]   out and said hey you know what the best one is olive oil right behind that is brassica and the
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:02.000]   one behind that's peanut oil in terms of high solubility and so now how do you collaborate that
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.440]   and say well what happens if you really actually you know stir it together what happens and so
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.280]   here we go I mean I want to point out this study and this is the one that everyone's most familiar
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:16.480]   with this is the 2012 pair of study that kind of kicked off C60 being a supplement the study is
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:22.640]   called the prolongation of lifespan by rats of of rats by repeated oral administration of C60
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.120]   fullerene okay so this is that whole study you know that the rats live twice along blah blah
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.600]   but the thing about this study was that you know this is the preparation process that these
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:36.800]   scientists used in order to produce the C60 in olive oil that they gave the rats
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.920]   which a lot of us are taking you know a lot of us are you're taking C60 in olive oil it was made
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:48.640]   this way because this became the literal benchmark formula that almost all manufacturers are following
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:54.000]   is this process by which you know these scientists had created their C60 oil so it kind of came you
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.640]   know became the main recipe for whatever one is following but at the end of the day after they
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:04.720]   measured their C60 oil from the process that they had created to make it they just you know
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:11.200]   their end product that they fed their rats which is why it's the benchmark right as C60 dissolved
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:17.040]   in olive oil it ended up being and this was a measured you know actually doing it in real life
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:24.720]   and not calculated but they came out with 0.8 so 0.8 milligrams per milliliter was kind of like
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.520]   that became the benchmark that's what everyone should shoot for so here you've got by calculation
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:34.880]   the you know the scientists in the other study said hey we calculate that you know you can get
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:44.720]   909 milligrams per liter which translates to 0.0 0.909 milligrams per milliliter so they were saying
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:51.040]   you should at least be able to get 0.9 milligrams per milliliter by calculation and then when scientists
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:57.760]   actually did it they came out with 0.8 milligrams per milliliter so it's pretty close I mean that's
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:03.360]   like 0.1 off and so you know it's kind of gives some credence to the idea that the calculations
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:09.040]   are fairly accurate because in real life you know they came within 0.1 milligrams per milliliter
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.840]   in terms of you know the actually creating the oil that you know the C60 oil that they
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.640]   used in the study so there's a lot of credence you can give to to some of the you know to the numbers
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.920]   in this study because of the fact that it corroborates with the actual physical results in this other
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:29.360]   study but then I also want to point out that there was one other study that did pop up in the
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:34.240]   literature and I don't want to be you know I just want to be real clear and transparent that
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.920]   there's this other study out there that was only one of the one of the other ones that I could
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:44.720]   find and I went through dozens trying to find you know specific studies on C60 and different oils
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.960]   and there's only like two and this was the other one but this one I just kind of really point out
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:54.960]   that I'm not including it in the discussion because their numbers are so bizarre I don't understand
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:00.400]   where they went well they did they go wrong or not but it just doesn't make any sense so
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:05.200]   and the reason I'm kind of hesitating to use this as as part of our discussion was the way
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:10.160]   that these scientists had used it and if anybody wants to look at it I'll put a link in the video
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.320]   description and you know I'd love to get your feedback on it but this study is called olive oil as a
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:20.720]   biocompatible solvent for pristine C60 okay so they wanted to study the solubility of C60
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:26.320]   in olive oil and they also wanted to study it in sunflower oil so they picked two different oils
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:31.680]   three different brands of oil per oil right so three different brands of olive oil
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.640]   three different brands of sunflower oil then they wanted to try it at three different temperatures
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:42.000]   but the thing that was really weird in this study was they tried to do it with 14 milligrams of C60
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.600]   in five milliliters of olive oil and so if you figure out what that is that comes out to they put
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:55.040]   2.8 milligrams per milliliter of C60 in there but they only stirred it for 72 hours right and they
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:59.520]   only stirred it for 72 hours and then they you know they used a you know they used a centrifuge
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:06.400]   afterwards so you know for all of us that make C60 and if you look at the benchmark which is you
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:13.520]   know this is the benchmark process they stir for two weeks and so these guys only stirred for 72
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.680]   hours and then they centrifuged it so there's no you know so that's really kind of the
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:23.600]   common sense reason why i'm not using this study as part of the discussion because when they
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:28.160]   did that they you know they didn't do it the way everyone else is doing it they only stirred for
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:34.160]   72 hours and when they spin out the you know when they spin the oil a lot of that C60 hadn't had time
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:40.320]   to dissolve into the oil and it spun out and ended up at the bottom of the tube in the centrifuge
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:47.520]   but what they did discover was that you know that their best their best solubility was 5.97
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:57.360]   micrograms per milliliter and so a microgram you know if you look at what is 5.97 micrograms
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:02.560]   well that in you know micrograms per milliliter well if you did some math on it that means that
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:08.480]   their end product or you know of their end result this one study determined that their best result
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:23.360]   in olive oil was a 0.00597 milligrams per milliliter so 0.00597 is a far cry from 0.8 you know and in
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:28.720]   the rat study 0.9 bic calculation so they definitely screwed up you know in terms of trying to get
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:34.160]   the best results and they just did a quick three-day stir and then they got the weakest results which
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.320]   is a real good reminder to all of you out there if you're making your own you really do need to
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:43.520]   stir for two weeks but nonetheless okay let's say you know they didn't they you know their study
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:48.400]   doesn't fit into my discussion on what the best oils are because they didn't try really hard
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:52.400]   to try to get the oil to dissolve you know they just did a quick study but what's interesting
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.920]   though is they did they did find out a couple of things that I do kind of want to point out
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:02.080]   that I think are fascinating that they discovered that you know in 72 hours that the higher the
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:08.560]   temperature the lower the amount which is the exact opposite if you do it longer because I've
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:14.320]   discovered that the longer you stir is the right way to do it right just follow the benchmark but
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:20.640]   the higher the temperature the better the results and so this was kind of an odd backwards discovery
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:26.320]   you know in terms of higher temperatures better results when they did it they got higher temperatures
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:30.960]   worse results but then at the same time you know I think the most important thing that comes out of
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:37.440]   this study was that it's not just any it's not any olive oil that's going to be a good candidate
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:43.920]   for slobility same with sunflower oil when they tested three different brands they got three different
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:50.000]   results in both types of oils and what's even more interesting was that a particular brand
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:58.640]   of sunflower oil from a brand called Venus actually had more C60 dissolved in it than the olive oil
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:02.560]   so you know so it's just really it's just so fascinating you know when you read all these
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:06.640]   different studies on how different people approach things and you try to kind of
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.640]   you know do this apples to apples comparison but at the end of the day you know I did throw
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.880]   this study out but I did want to mention it because I know you guys and you're so smart
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.800]   someone's going to go but what about this other study and so here's that other study
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:25.360]   but here's one more thing that you may not be aware of was that somewhere back in time
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:30.640]   and I don't remember what time I you know I'm kind of a pack rat of information and
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.600]   somewhere back in time somewhere in one of our chat groups in our C60 chat group
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.400]   somebody did a study and and one of you guys and if you're watching this you know hey great to
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:46.640]   find out who you are because your name's not on the document but there's a document that I discovered
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:54.320]   that had that were someone one of the members of our chat group actually did a C60 solubility study
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:34:02.320]   in his home and he did a thorough very impressive job and so now this C60 study he just called the
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:09.520]   homemade C60 dilution evaluation in various oils he started into a November of 2018 and he updated
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:16.960]   his study and he when he repeated it in April of 2019 I'm assuming it's a he okay but what it what's
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.080]   real interesting is that he kind of was very adamant about following the benchmark results he used
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:29.360]   red line pulverized C60 he he mixed he stirred it at 20 degrees centigrade which was the recommendation
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:35.840]   that the red line puts out for their C60 he stirred for three weeks let it rest for 10 filtered it
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:41.520]   you know just like the the rat study guys did and then his and his concentration was 0.8 grams
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:47.760]   per per liter which is 0.8 milligrams per liter so he you know he followed the benchmark recipe
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:52.880]   formula and then what his results were which is what's real interesting is his results were
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:35:00.240]   that and he just did it by eyeball okay so by eyeball meaning coloration and also by eyeball
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:06.640]   what's what's left over how much C60 is left over in the bottom of the beaker after he was finished
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:12.480]   stirring and so if you kind of take a look at his study he actually shares his notes per different
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:20.080]   types of oils he tried three different oils and then he basically documented the residual C60
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:25.040]   remaining on the filters as well as in the bottle of the jars after processing and then he also
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:31.920]   compares that to the different colorations of the oils once he was finished with the result so
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.160]   even though it's not he wasn't you know obviously he's just like myself you know we don't own
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:41.040]   you know all the equipment you need to actually do an actual physical measurement but what he did
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:47.680]   was by just simply looking at the amount of residue he discovered that the high olecate oleic
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:54.640]   sunflower oil which is sort of what Bob's using right and grapeseed oil there was no C60
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:59.440]   remaining that all of it got dissolved into the oil so that there was nothing left at the bottom
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.640]   of the jar after mixing and he kind of rates it from low to high where the next one up was sesame
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:11.280]   and then the bottom one here was walnut oil where it had the most amount of left over C60 so can we
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:17.280]   use this study to determine whether or not these these oils are soluble absolutely it's how I do
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:22.800]   it whatever's left is what is what didn't get you know so it's a great way to look at it like
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:28.240]   how much C60 is left if there's nothing left you know that oil is really soluble so there you go
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.040]   so this is one more data point towards our discussion about solubility in terms of like what are the
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:37.680]   best oils so if you want to read this study I'll put a link in the video description so the last
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:43.280]   thing I kind of want to add on is a wild card it's not an oil it's a fatty acid called oleic acid just
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:50.240]   by itself now we know from prior discussions that olive oil for in for instance is comprised of six
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.760]   or seven different fatty acid esters and those and one of those fatty acid esters was oleic oil
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.480]   which is omega 9 and if it's really high in omega 9 that's a good thing versus high in oleic and
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:06.240]   omega 6 is a bad thing but omega 9 is a good thing so having it high in oleic acid is a very
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:12.320]   very healthy goil and so what's interesting about that is that there's actually a product out there
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:18.640]   that's just made in C60 in oleic acid you know and it's kind of interesting that someone would
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:23.920]   just actually pluck out one specific fatty acid out of oil olive oil and say hey that's the one
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.320]   I'm going to use for the product and it's no other than iron Mitchell from wizard science
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:34.320]   is now for those of you who recognize his name iron Mitchell is was one of the top leading C60
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.240]   scientists in in the world I mean you got Bob Resk out there and you've got iron Mitchell and
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:43.600]   you've got a couple others but they're literally only less than a handful of these guys who understand
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:49.680]   C60 beyond anyone else understanding it and so what's really cool about what iron has produced
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:55.600]   at wizard sciences was that one of his products that he's called vortex rx for pets he's made it
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:01.200]   purely with oleic acid if you see here right here on on the label and that's what he's using he's
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:06.720]   not using olive oil or any other type of oil he's using a fatty acid and so when you take a look
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.960]   at that you're like wow and that's that's really really interesting that he would choose that
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.800]   but just for the fact that who he is and that he chose it to use in a product
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:20.720]   I think is a definite data point in this discussion as to what's the best soluble
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:26.080]   because if anybody knows what's the best soluble oil or let's say in this case fatty acid for C60
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.360]   it's going to be iron Mitchell and just kind of give you an idea here you know when you take a
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:34.160]   look at olive oil well you know olive oil could be anywhere from 55 to 83 percent oleic acid
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:40.560]   depending on where you get it from and then avocado oil is equally as as high in oleic acid so
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:46.080]   it could be anywhere from 50 to 70 percent oleic acid and that's avocado oil so it kind of gives
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:50.880]   you the really I think that you know by irons kind of like divulging you know he kind of found
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:56.240]   like this this thing out there that works really well with C60 he's the only one doing it this way
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:39:00.400]   but just the fact that he did it and then when you say well does how does olive oil and avocado
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:05.360]   oil stand up against oleic acid then you realize well that's the majority of what they're made of
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.720]   so you know why wouldn't that be a really good thing since we know that these are really
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:13.920]   too good soluble oils for C60 so kind of just kind of all comes full circle on that and I just
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.880]   wanted to really add it in because it's kind of a wild card nobody else is doing this and I found
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.880]   it to be fascinating when I was doing research on who's using what oils that there was a product
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:27.680]   out there that wasn't even using an actual oil it was just using a fatty acid ester so I wanted
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.200]   to make sure that you guys are aware of that and just want to share it with you so anyway at the
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:36.240]   end of the day in conclusion and thank you for hanging out in the video this long but in conclusion I
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:42.000]   just want to say that based on the research based on what the studies show based on what people
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.680]   have done based on what what people are doing in the marketplace like Bob Greska and I and Mitchell
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:52.480]   and based on on all of that information and and the amount of time that I put into this
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:56.400]   and you know you could read the studies for yourself you know go for it I put the links in
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:05.280]   but the best oils pending further research the best oils for C60 based on being a healthy oil
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:10.960]   and a high soluble healthy oil then what you're going to want to look for when you're buying it
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:16.000]   or if you're mixing your own is you definitely want to stick to a high quality olive oil
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.320]   avocado oil because if it's oleic acid content or just going straight with oleic acid and I'm
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:27.280]   telling you right now because I read that thing from IN I'm really interested in making C60 with
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:32.800]   oleic acid now but that's definitely one of them out there that you could use and then also too
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.920]   you know when you're looking at seed oils that there are really a good soluble seed oils but
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:44.400]   again it needs to be low omega-6 solvent free seed oils and then if you're going to use
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:50.080]   seed oils then definitely you're going to want to use based on the studies that brassica which
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:58.160]   is rape seed oil is is really good for C60 grape seed oil peanut oil and sunflower oil are all
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:06.480]   really really good soluble oils for C60 but make sure that it is low in omega-6 and solvent free
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:13.040]   so there you go that's the list and those are the best oils for C60 for health and for
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:17.600]   solubility so thank you very much for sticking out this long on the video I hope you found this
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:22.960]   interesting I love doing research projects like this and I learned so much and my whole
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.600]   channel is all about you know I do this stuff this is my hobby and I just really like to share it with
