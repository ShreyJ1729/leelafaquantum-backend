[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinker's Academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and this
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.960]   video is another installment in the video series. Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.640]   Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade. This is a video FAQ series and the question for this video is
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.880]   what is the difference between heel and heel 360. So the very first thing is the short answer. Now
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.400]   if you take a look at the marketing information about the 360 which is a brand new frequency and
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.160]   it's also a product that came out just recently then what they're basically saying in the marketing
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.560]   literature that the 360 with the primary distinction between the 360 capsule and the regular heel
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:45.760]   capsule that's been on sale for years is the 360 capsule's enhanced ability to promote power,
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.440]   recovery and well-being on all levels emotional, energetic and physical. Now obviously that really
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.840]   doesn't help you make a choice because you know how do you compare the two. So let's talk about key
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.640]   benefits all right. Now the original heel which is like the flagship product for Layla Quantum
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.400]   Tech what that frequency is now it now it also you know so they kind of do the same thing which
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.760]   is understandably why there's confusion. So if we just talk about the heel now the original heel
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.120]   capsule and the heel you know the heel frequency right it promotes physical, mental and spiritual
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:23.840]   health it promotes health think of it that way also on an on an emotional level as well I mean when
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.400]   it first came out a lot of people had emotional reactions to it as well as physical right.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.640]   It also helps connect with our own healing abilities you know within our own bodies we can
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.560]   heal ourselves so it helps us connect with that that you know that power and then also it includes
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.520]   80 essential vitamins, minerals and organic plant extracts that will nourish you from within so
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.800]   it's got both etheric frequencies it's also got molecular frequencies okay so it's got two
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:00.080]   different types of frequencies in there and so now the heel 360 it just came out this year in 2024
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.760]   now it specifically promotes overall well-being and balance okay it activates a self-healing power
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.160]   on a physical emotional and mental level and it's suitable for use at any time or in any situation
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.360]   it helps create greater harmony in your daily life now that's from the marketing material so
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.720]   again it does sound like they're very much the same and I realize that so what I kind of am doing
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.360]   you know for me the way I look at this is the frequencies that Leila Quantum Tech sells
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.800]   they kind of fall into three categories and they fall into frequencies that you know that will
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.160]   support your health benefit your health you know it's all about you your physical being your emotional
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.520]   being your spiritual being right and then there's frequencies for helping you heal like if there's
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.240]   something that you're going through that you need healing from and it could be on any one of those
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.280]   different categories of you know of how we feel right physically emotionally whatever
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.520]   so there's a there's one that promotes health and there's one that promotes healing when you need
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.240]   healing which is really kind of two separate things right and then there's a third category
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.680]   of frequencies that are available for manifesting things that you know vibrations and manifesting
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.280]   stuff that you want to bring into your life and so how I categorize these two different frequencies
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.920]   because they are very similar is I look at the original heal as more of a health frequency
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.400]   okay it's more of maintaining your health and promoting health okay and then the heal 360
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.920]   frequency I look at it as more of a healing frequency so if you're going through something
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.880]   and you and you really want to kind of like you know are you looking for solutions that'll help you
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.080]   heal from whatever that may be you know that that's troubling you then it's going to be more so for
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.960]   your healing and the other one's going to be more so for promoting your health keeping you know
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.840]   maintaining your health versus repairing your health okay so those are the two ways that I look
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.880]   at these when you actually get into the weeds and so that's kind of where I just kind of want to give
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.600]   you that's the short answer so if you're looking for something that's for general health and promoting
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.200]   health great the heal capsule the heal frequency run that on quantum upgrade if you're looking to
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.040]   repair you're looking to you know kind of a look for a solution for something that you want to heal
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.800]   then definitely go with the heal 360 in fact the heal 360 is such a powerful healing frequency
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.280]   that it's being embedded in the new jacket that's coming out because when you know when you're out
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.040]   and about in in heavy emf smog and or in airplanes and whatever your body's constantly being you
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.560]   know subjected to all that you know radiation right so they've actually put the heal 360
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.960]   frequency in the jacket to kind of help your body heal and repair as it's being exposed to emf so
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.560]   that's just kind of gives you an idea how of a how much of a strong healing frequency that is
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.080]   all right so now for those of you who are interested and you want more information
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.600]   here's the long answer so you got the short answer there you go that's the answer right
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.800]   now the longer answer I just kind of want to explain some things for anyone who's interested
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.600]   is that the the word heal for the heal and the heal 360 it's not a word it's an acronym
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.240]   it doesn't mean heal as in healing it stands for holistic experience abundance and love
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.800]   it's an acronym and so it kind of just encompasses a wide variety of things under it under this umbrella
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.200]   of a holistic experience abundance and love and so to give you an idea the original heal frequency
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.320]   consists it's kind of like a frequency set it's a combination of frequencies within you know under
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:47.680]   that umbrella and so the original heal has the primal human healing frequency this is not source
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:56.000]   frequency okay this is the frequency of our biological um base I guess it's kind of really
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.920]   hard to explain right but it's our it's the primal human healing frequency is the frequency our own
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.840]   bodies generate whenever it needs to to basically you know maintain itself so it's it's that human
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.560]   healing and yeah we're we're crossing lines again you know is it a health thing or is a healing thing
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.720]   but it's more of a health thing because it helps you you know because you naturally as part of your
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.760]   health you're regenerating you're repairing constantly right every single day your body's
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.760]   continually doing that and that's that frequency within you all right it also contains primal water
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.840]   frequencies these are you know just the waters on the planet that have been discovered to be
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:40.720]   very very conducive towards having energetic properties okay so they went around the world
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.840]   collected samples of the water and they created this you know they put it together as frequency
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.960]   and then it has the neutral nutritional bio-based frequencies now that's the difference here in
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:58.080]   frequencies where when you take a look at what are the actual you know vitamins and minerals that
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.360]   are inside the regular heal frequency you can go and i'll put a link in the video description
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.680]   if you want to read this but here's the list of all of the different frequencies and these are
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.560]   molecular frequencies everything has a frequency right so there's the frequency of all of these
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.520]   substances are put into that neutral bio-base and this came from one of the healers in the healer
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.320]   network which is something that this individual had been you know sharing with their followers
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.280]   for years and so they added it to the original heal frequency when they came up with that product
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.400]   but there's just a ton of things that are really which you know this healer discovered which are
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.760]   really supportive of our physical self and so by feeding these frequencies into our bio field
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.720]   it helps promote our health okay and so that's kind of where that exists so that's
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.160]   the bio-base nutritional bio-base frequency is part of that original heal and that's what's in that
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:54.400]   heal so the heal frequency has got that primal human healing frequency primal water and nutritional
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.560]   bio-base all collected together under the umbrella of the word you know the acronym heal now when they
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.760]   came along and created the heal 360 which was actually the result of a contest looking for a
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.840]   pain management solution and they they stumbled across this other frequency that was not you know
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   well they actually ended up with a pain management frequency it's a separate thing but then they
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:22.000]   discovered like this one entry was so amazing that it it what's became its own frequency you know on
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.560]   the site and and you know it won the contest as well now that frequency was created by one of the
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:35.360]   members of our telegram chat groups and it contains 45 different molecular frequencies okay and again
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:42.560]   the molecular let me the molecular frequencies for this guy is basically the heal 360 so you
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.960]   can see there's over 45 different frequencies combined that create this incredible harmonic
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.880]   that helps our body heal itself and our help you know and on a spiritual physical emotional level
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.240]   right so it's got all this or great organic stuff it's got essential oils in it it's got life
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:06.720]   extension stuff it's got all sorts of miscellaneous i mean this this list and again it'll be in the
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.960]   description if you want to take a look at it is a huge difference between the nutritional
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.680]   bio-base right nutritional bio-base is what your body needs to just you know walk around on the
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:21.200]   planet this stuff which is the molecular frequencies from all of these substances are basically
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:27.040]   something that's completely different other than you know it's not a maintain your health thing this
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:33.680]   is a move the dial on other aspects of your being stuff right you know and so that's kind of what
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:39.440]   all of these different these molecular frequencies were combined and that's what is the heal 360
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.240]   frequency so that's the difference between them as like what exactly is within each one of these
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:49.600]   things okay and last they just want to let you know that now the these are two different frequencies
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.840]   so you know heal and heal 360 are two different frequencies and they're embedded in capsules and
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:02.320]   on cards available on lela quantum text you can get a capsule here's an example of the lela three
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.400]   or heal 360 capsule at lela quantum tech website links in the video description and so you can go
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:13.920]   there and get a capsule with that frequency embedded in it you can also get one capsule that's got the
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.400]   regular heal frequency depending on what your objective is right so you can get it as a capsule
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.400]   now you also can get it on a little business mental business card the difference primarily
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.680]   is is the cards a lot less you know energetic so the cards would have to be carried on your
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.040]   person it's got a field of about four inches whereas a capsule has a field about six feet
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.400]   in terms of an energetic bubble you know around you that'll just immerse yourself in that frequency
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.320]   okay now you can also subscribe to quantum upgrade and get one of the get the heal bundle it's like
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.080]   an extra ten dollars a month and then you could add these frequencies into your
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.920]   subscription and have them sent to you and you could try either frequency that way
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.160]   all right so those are the two ways to experience the frequency and that's the long answer so thank
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.200]   you very much for listening i hope this was helpful for you and i just want to say thanks for your time
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.240]   veland dong toward german friends and if you want to keep on top of lela quantum tech information
