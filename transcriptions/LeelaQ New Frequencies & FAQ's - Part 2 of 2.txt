[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K. Elmer and this is part two of a two-part video
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.520]   Interview that I had with Phillip on Holson Dorff of Leila quantum tech. Thank you very much, Phillip
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.880]   And in this part two is where we cover the five frequently asked questions that are popping up over and over and over
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.000]   In our telegram chat group. So those five questions
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   That we talk about in this video is number one, you know
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.600]   Mixing and matching frequencies, which comes up all the time like how many frequencies is too many frequencies
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.420]   Which ones go well together and that sort of things and which ones shouldn't go well and even Philip threw in some like when
[00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.040]   What time of day would be better to use certain ones?
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.600]   So I you know that's you know, so he provides I basically was just pinging him, you know with all these different questions
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.680]   Number two that we talk about is cards versus capsules versus blocks
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.660]   Which is a question that pops up all the time about you know
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.120]   Hey, I'm thinking about, you know, I want to try this and would you should I get a cube block or eye block or should a
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.980]   Carder capsules we talk about you know what the devices are and and what they're best for and that was when number two question
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.580]   The third one we talk about is using frequencies with blocks
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.980]   You know like how do I like, you know put something in an eye block and and and you know and then and then and permeate that
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.960]   Frequency throughout the field that sort of thing and what's the best practices for that number four is something that comes up all the time
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.400]   And it's just people, you know, we're just trying to see, you know
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.640]   How can quantum energy or these frequencies or both right, you know?
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.760]   How can it help them with their overall health and wellness because so many people post, you know
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.800]   I know so-and-so with this or I have this issue and you know
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.080]   And would this be good for that and and so this is something that I really wanted to kind of cover with Philip to kind
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.840]   Of address in general and and just really talk about you know
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.760]   How this can work for you and the last one is is is one of my crazy tinks where you know
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.000]   it's about how to you know using this the cue block or the eye block or the quantum energy in general and
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.320]   Charging you, you know
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.400]   We talk a lot about charging objects plants and jewelry and water and you know so forth
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.960]   But you know one of the things that kind of gets overlooked sometimes is charging ourselves
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.920]   And and and what are all the do's and don'ts and recommendations from Philip for that so it's it's a great conversation
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.240]   I think this is probably an awesome aspect of you know the user guide, right?
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.080]   So I just wanted to share that with you this is part two without further ado
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.200]   Let's jump right into the content and where I'm talking with Philip in the interview, but first let's cover the disclaimers
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.320]   Neither lay the quantum tech nor the Tinkers Academy recommend or endorse any specific tests physicians procedures opinions or other information
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:44.000]   That may be mentioned in this video relies on any information appearing and discuss in this video solely at everyone's own risk

[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.800]   All right, let's jump in. All right, so let's jump into the FAQs now what I did was this is the list
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.440]   Everybody and I just picked five because I mean I want to keep the video reasonable
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.440]   And you know we kind of started touching on to this one which is like and these are just me reading the chat
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.000]   I read everything and so it's kind of just seems like the number one thing people have been asking about is mixing and matching
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.760]   Frequencies so and you know you and I just touched on like which ones go well with each other
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.280]   It's kind of like that old sesame Street, you know thing that our kids watch right that little song which ones will not like the others
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.840]   right, and so
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.900]   Yeah, it's like which ones go well with it
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.180]   But let me the first question that always comes up and I've answered it myself and but in so let's what's your answer to?
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.840]   You know how many is too many like like you know cuz just just right off the bat the nutritional biobase is like
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.680]   60 different things that you know the men's booster and the women's literally over 60
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:05.200]   Different frequencies blended into one set right so when you start mixing and matching you could have end up with hundreds of
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.400]   Different frequent frequencies all and you know you're carrying around all at the same time
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.640]   So what you know so hum you know how many is too many or does the body just use what it needs?
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.720]   So what you know what's your advice on that mixing and matching frequencies?
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.200]   Yeah, so I
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   Try to differentiate a little bit
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.440]   Between those you know molecular frequencies how you describe them like the biobase or
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.840]   The women's booster man's booster and then some of the other ones in general on a higher level
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.120]   I would say you know look at what you would like to work on and
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.880]   then see if if
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:51.400]   That relates to each other. So if you know if you have some sleep problems
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.880]   you may as well start off with the inner peace because
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.160]   It may just be a little bit of your mind and something that is just
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.920]   so present within you that you
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:09.120]   You're wrapping your mind around the whole time that you can't let go or or you can't figure out whatever and then the inner peace
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.400]   may be a great way to actually help with that and then
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.600]   Possibly the sleep and rest would actually be something that you can use in addition to that
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.280]   So those would go really well with each other
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:28.200]   For an example, you know, we said the forever young and the heal frequency would go well together something that
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.000]   You know, I don't think would go so well
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.080]   together is
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:45.480]   Well, it's actually a hard to say because there's also no general rules, right?
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.160]   So but the agony power and the sleep and rest for example would would
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.400]   Really exclude themselves a little bit because the agony power is
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.440]   While it really stimulates the heart chakra to, you know, help it the unconditional love becomes the
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.400]   main force in our lives
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:15.560]   It it has quite some energetic power to it that we've found and recommended that people should just wear this throughout the day or not at night
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.000]   so
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.280]   That just from that standpoint it wouldn't really go with a steep and rest which we would only use at night and not during the day because
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.480]   You don't miss all you want to sleep during the day
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:34.960]   Yeah, I would I would not and I would not focus on too many things at the same time
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.560]   So if let's say if if someone has real money issues, right?
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:47.360]   Something with the money flow is is really off with a wealth. You just, you know, work your ass off and you do what you can and you're just
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.880]   Just not getting there. It's you know
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   There is ways to actually
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.960]   Establish that frequency and that resonance field within us to actually attract that and to get through
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.440]   These blockages or things that are in the way and it may actually be our own belief system, right?
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:15.400]   And that we're just not consciously aware of so those things the prosperity card helps with so but if I want to work on something like that
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.240]   I don't
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:25.880]   Take the happiness the forever young and the the inner peace card all together and work on all those things. It's just
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:32.120]   You know if you learn how to play tennis, you know for for 10-15 minutes
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:38.800]   You're gonna work on your serve and then maybe later you're gonna practice your forehand and things like that and
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:45.040]   You know, you that's how you learn better and that's how you focus better
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.640]   So you don't want to take in too much at the same time because then it the focus is gone and then it just
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:08:00.040]   Waters things down. So if you want to have better and faster results, just use that for a while or
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.720]   You know use the prosperity for a day and then if you feel like okay, you
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.400]   You want now inner peace next day you mix them up it that doesn't really matter
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.560]   But I don't want to I wouldn't suggest to use too many at the same time
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.320]   It's just it's not gonna
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.200]   Help you too much whereas we can say that abundance in general is something that
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.320]   Abundance is way broader than than prosperity because that's really the inner abundance and it
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.600]   Once you can create inner abundance also abundance
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.120]   Will reflect in the outer life and you know prosperity would be a part of it
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.520]   so in a way those two go pretty well together and
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.600]   last point now to those
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.720]   physical or molecular
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.840]   frequencies
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.720]   Yeah, you know 75 or 76
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:59.520]   You know minerals vitamins and all that sounds like a lot, but in the end of the day. It's also not so much
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.400]   especially because they're
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.480]   They're
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.880]   The way they're created is that they actually support the
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:15.360]   Human body in an optimal way. It's actually those are there's have been some time scientists over three decades that actually
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.760]   Came up with this bio base makes that we're using for that
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   So even on a physical level that works
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:29.720]   Perfectly so on an energetic level totally fine. Yeah, I wouldn't worry about that
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.680]   Yeah, yeah, cuz they all do a very specific thing in your body
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.640]   I mean if you take 30 different minerals each one has a purpose and
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.320]   Well, that's why our bodies require like what is it the 82 different minerals in the world
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.640]   We have there's a purpose for every single one of those minerals in our body because we are of earth, right?
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.120]   But yeah, yeah, okay, good. No, that's a really good explanation
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.440]   so it's kind of like
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:57.080]   Think about what you want to achieve and hone in on that one and then just hone in on it
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.560]   and
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:05.280]   Like you would not want to try testosterone booster and then try to get some sleep kind of thing, you know, right?
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.440]   Probably not. Yeah, it's because these like the boosters are gonna give you energy
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:16.160]   And so you can't do you can't relax and then have and then have energy at the same time. So that makes sense
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.280]   So okay, so yeah everybody out there just you know really hone in on what is your target?
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:30.280]   What do you want to what's your objective and then what would best support that and and then in terms of mixing and matching frequencies?
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:36.040]   Because a lot of people you know have the heel capsule and that's their biggest question is I have a heel
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:42.560]   So which ones could I add with the heel and so because heel is primal human healing which supports your life?
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.240]   Then I think well, what was there anything that wouldn't go with heel?
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:55.880]   Well, so the thing is that so the heel frequency that's in the capsules also contains the
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.840]   Primal healing water frequency as well as the biobase. So that's all included in that one. So
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:09.760]   I'm not too sure if I would want to use the testosterone
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:19.060]   Booster or the main booster together with it. You know, I've tested those and I would so that's my just my personal
[00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.600]   Opinion for myself that I would use them
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:31.120]   like in a rotating fashion versus in parallel and this may be because
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:39.480]   Maybe those aren't too many things to focus on. I don't know but it may also be different for other people, right?
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.720]   so
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:47.200]   It yeah, I think a lot of things go with it. Well, but then we found for example that people that have gotten the
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.040]   You know the thing in their arm
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.480]   That if they had now the DNA and cells protect
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:02.680]   Also wanting to try the heel with it. It was actually too much for them
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:08.360]   Oh, it wasn't too much for the ones that had not gotten, you know the needle in the arm. Ah
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:17.840]   We don't really know why that is it's probably because their system was already so overwhelmed that they
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.920]   they got even more sensitive to to to everything they're they're taking in and
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.600]   So in that sense, I would you know if someone
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.920]   Can't do the DNA and cell protect or doesn't have that
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.240]   You know, but has the heel and you use that one
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:44.080]   But if you have the DNA and cell protect then then use that one and don't don't use the heel or or rotate that right?
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.400]   That's really good advice. Okay. No, that's really helpful. All right. So thank you
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.800]   For that. I think that that really kind of clarifies mixing and matching
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.360]   Obviously if any if anybody has any questions
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.400]   I'll just feel free to jump into the telegram and and go ahead and post your question
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:05.040]   So the other question that I'm seeing most recently Phillip is this whole issue between you know
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.760]   What's like the like what should I you know, I the question is usually posed. Hey, I'm new here
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:16.040]   You know should I get a card or should I get a capsule and then the other question is is and these are your flagship products
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:21.080]   So people are saying, you know should I get a card should I get a capsule and then you've got people saying
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.120]   You know should I get a quantum or infinity block?
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:30.000]   You know and so those are the questions that I'm seeing as relates to products and so I was wondering if you could kind of just share
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:38.440]   like, you know, what I guess in general terms like what's the the like what if you want something X, right?
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.160]   What is if your objective is X, then this is the best one if your objective is that, you know that kind of thing
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.400]   So what would you say from a standpoint of all your different products?
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:52.880]   What's like what's your one liner that would say hey if you're looking for X, then this is what for you
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.520]   If you want why then, you know try that so let's let's start with these two guys right here
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.120]   What do you what would you recommend if someone says should I get a frequency card or should I get a capsule?
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.840]   Yeah, and I probably would have given a different answer seven months ago
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:17.600]   Just because of you know where we've been going and you know mentioning the DNA and cell protector
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:24.880]   Card, you know, we don't have that available as a capsule. We've been asked if we could create a capsule actually, but it's
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:31.440]   Just so much on all plate right now that so far we haven't been able to and it's just available as a card. So
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:38.320]   For that specific use case, we can just say yeah use use that card, you know
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:45.040]   And for all the other use cases it depends on if you have really something where
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:50.520]   You find something among those frequency cards that you really
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:55.600]   Resonate with that that you think okay. This is you know my heart is calling
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:03.000]   For this and and I know really this is something kind of that I want to achieve or get to
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.640]   Now or this you know because I'm always like so hyper and I just I can't
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.440]   Relax and I'm always full of anxiety
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.480]   You know, I don't want that anymore like you kind of make this decision
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:15.840]   Okay
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.320]   So now I want to get into more inner peace then yeah if you find one of those
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.080]   frequencies there that your heart resonates with
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.280]   Then that would be the best way to go and to start experimenting
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.960]   or experiencing
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:38.820]   How the world of frequency and quantum energy actually can work for you? Okay. Um, if you don't have anything very
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:43.880]   Specific or you're just you know, you just want to stay in good shape
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:49.000]   you you want to have your inner healer activated your self healing powers activated and
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.600]   just be
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.600]   energetically supported and
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:59.640]   Obviously also mitigate emf then the capsule the the heal capsule is
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.840]   The way to go and it's a great starter also for people to
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:10.640]   Start feeling some of this energy and experimenting with it. So yeah, that's how I would
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:16.600]   Describe it and then the capsule in general is a little bit stronger in terms of quantum energy
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.120]   So it provides a little bit more energetic support in that sense
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.440]   But then again, it you know, it's it's only available with this specific frequency set
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:30.080]   That's how I would say both of them are are great
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.360]   beginner pro products on one end
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.280]   But on the other hand, they're all also advanced
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:44.320]   Products right because you can leverage them in so many different ways and then the frequency cards
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.040]   that's what
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.800]   people that just
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:56.840]   Read through the product list for example, usually don't understand it first is you you can not only use the frequency
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:02.560]   Cards for yourself in your pocket as your inner healing their pocket you could use it in
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.080]   order to work with the quantum block later on and
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:12.720]   actually copy these frequencies on to other objects or you know, make
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:19.560]   Make make a certain product that you you know give away to your grandma or you know your kids
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.200]   And and work with it that way or even
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.800]   Yeah, you know
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:33.560]   Multiply them in a way and you have your family to be be protected and in different ways
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:40.200]   So that's what you can do also with the frequency cards and then these other to the quantum block and the community bug. That's the actual
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.560]   technology that we also work with that is
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:50.360]   way broader it gives a way broader set of use cases and
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:56.120]   It it's there for the whole home for the whole family, you know for your whole land
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:01.120]   if we're talking the infinity block really up to a big farm that it can cover and
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:11.560]   Yeah, so there are lots of different things that you can do that obviously you can't do with a capsule or a card
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.960]   Okay, because I created this diagram because I was answering a question the other day
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:24.600]   Where someone wanted to you know ask about EMF for their car and so and let me just so it's correct to say right?
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.280]   That you know like all of the frequency cards apply to you and your body
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.640]   so if you wanted to try any one of these frequencies then
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:39.720]   Then obviously just get the card and then if you carry it around then you are you your body is experiencing
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.360]   That frequency, but for someone let's say I wanted to cover their whole car
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:48.360]   Which extends beyond you know their physical self
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:54.840]   Then as I understand the capsule like has kind of like a field about six feet in diameter, right?
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:19:01.440]   And so if they had a capsule and the heel capsule does have an EMF protective frequency and that's been
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.040]   validated through third-party testing
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:10.440]   So that if they were concerned about like driving around an electric vehicle and I'm worried about the EMF
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:18.000]   Then if they should probably get a capsule right because then then them then they'll literally be in a little bubble of EMF
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.160]   You know supportive frequency, right?
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:26.280]   And that would be like that is absolutely correct. Yes, that is correct and capsule, right? Yeah, yeah
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.320]   Well, yeah, so if it's just for you one capsule is great
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.760]   If you really want to cover your whole car and everybody else in that car
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:44.480]   Then we usually recommend three to four capsules depending on how large the vehicle is because they're they're also very big
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:50.920]   You know, there's a big van you probably need four capsules that are placed in different spots
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:56.240]   But yeah, that's how you could you could go about it. If it's just yourself
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:05.400]   and absolutely one capsule is enough and also what I didn't even mention earlier, you know, there are frequency cards for
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:14.320]   Plants and for dogs and cats as well. So yeah, those would be that you don't obviously leverage it for your own body
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:19.880]   It's it's something that you would help your cats with or your dog or your plants and
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:26.360]   We've been doing some interesting experiments actually with with with plants recently and it's
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.360]   It's quite amazing how plants react. We have this one plant that is
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:38.040]   We don't actually know what to do with it now because it's it's gotten so big and so huge that we
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.720]   We need to do something with it
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:48.340]   But that's a good problem to have rather than it. Okay. Yeah, cuz you're you also have a line of pet products and like
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:54.680]   Collars right and so that these different heel frequencies for different cats or a cat or dog
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:02.160]   Come in in a collar, but if you had the frequency, then what do you recommend just putting the card like under where they sleep?
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:07.040]   Or under their water bowl or something like that. Would that be the recommendation for that?
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:14.520]   Yes, so I can tell you how we do it with with our dog. So we have this heel for dog frequency card and
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:21.000]   There are certain spots where dogs tend to hang out right and in this one spot. It's this
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.960]   sofa type and then there's
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.800]   like a little
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:35.280]   mat on top of it and and underneath that that's where the the cart lays and she goes there a lot and
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:41.440]   Loves it there and that's how she can benefit from it. But then if people have a
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.640]   Quantum blog for example, then they can certainly also
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.400]   You know put that frequency into
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:55.440]   The dog bowl or the cat bowl and things like that. So you can start playing around with it leveraging
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:03.000]   It even more and yeah, sometimes, you know when when our dog didn't do well, you know after those
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.900]   Vaccines that she had to take for example
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:11.120]   Then we also took this card away from the sofa and where she slept at night and put it there
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:17.760]   So yeah, those are some ways and how to leverage it. Yeah, what I did was because I have a block
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.920]   I'm able to make my own devices. So I basically made necklaces for my dogs
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:28.600]   And I charge them with the heel for dogs and they were their necklaces and that's kind of how I did it
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:34.440]   Okay, so the other half of that question was is people are saying hey should I get a cue block or an infinity block?
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.200]   And so my answer to that and you could if you could comment on it is hey
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:44.240]   It's the size of the field. So a cue block would basically be 130 feet diameter field
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.920]   Right and then so it's really like okay
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:53.120]   I would get a cue block if I wanted my whole entire home to be in the same quantum energy field
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.880]   But then an infinity block goes out to a whole kilometer, which is 0.62 miles
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:05.960]   So it really depends on do I want to like let's say get a capsule and and charge me and everything around me it's within six feet
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:14.520]   Cue block would be for a home or a infinity block would be for a much bigger area a neighborhood or a farm or something like that
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:21.000]   So though that's is would you say that's the primary the the primary difference is the size of the field I?
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.320]   Would add to that because it's it's the
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.280]   it's the level of
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:35.200]   Consciousness, so that's how we can describe it or you could say the the depth and
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.760]   level of
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:44.020]   pure quantum energy, you know the strengths the concentration of the field because it is
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.120]   Stronger with the infinity block
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:52.720]   And it's certainly even stronger with an advanced infinity block
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.480]   Right people that have the infinity block package know what I'm talking about, you know, you can do your
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:01.800]   upgrades at any time and then you know if you have a
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:07.760]   fourth generation infinity block for example that then creates a
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.520]   way denser and more concentrated field
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.800]   then
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:21.280]   The basic infinity block does and certainly even more than the the quantum block does so that that adds to that
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:28.760]   So it's not just the radius. It's also really the density of the field and it's then also the density
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.400]   Within the plates, right? So if if I put my hand
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.440]   Inside an infinity block
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.640]   There's there's much more
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.920]   stability for
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.760]   Certain positive effects that I'm
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:53.040]   That I'm going after right when I do that then when I place it in the quantum block
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.400]   So from that standpoint, that's another
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.880]   difference
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.160]   then
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.880]   There's the and then you know some people may wonder okay, so you know obviously, you know, I want
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.720]   more consciousness I want
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.480]   more or stronger quantum energy
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:17.960]   And all of that and I would also like it if my whole garden is covered so it's certainly the infinity block for me
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:23.700]   Oh, yeah, and then I want to upgrade and all that okay, then that's an easy question, but there's just
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:31.200]   two things of you know, or three things maybe in regards to the quantum block first of all if you're a beginner and
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:37.040]   you haven't really done a lot of energy work at all or you haven't experimented with a
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:44.500]   quantum energy then the quantum block would be the way to go and then you can see for yourself if you know at some point and
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.160]   infinity block may be
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.800]   the next step
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:56.320]   However, there are really two use cases that we don't recommend the infinity block to be used for but just the quantum block
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.040]   that is to
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.880]   neutralize
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.040]   Potentially harmful frequencies of pharmaceuticals that is one
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.720]   let's say you you have an ibuprofen that you need to take because you I
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:18.120]   Don't have a lot of things you can put that into the quantum block and then it neutralizes
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.080]   these potentially harmful
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.280]   frequency, so you basically take a
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:31.960]   Clean product afterwards, you know at least of way way cleaner product then before you know that still does its job
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.960]   But it's it's way cleaner
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.160]   and more pure
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:42.640]   Then then before if you do that in the infinity block though, then that is so strong
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:48.400]   And by the way in the quantum block also there's also time limit for that which we describe on the website
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:55.280]   But the infinity block is it's just it works so so fast and so instant that it
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:02.400]   adds homeopathic levels of the substance you put in in in a way that you can't
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:10.040]   Estimate any more, you know, how how high is that homeopathic dose now that has been added?
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:14.760]   So we literally did several tests with that with multiple different substances, and it's
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.880]   it's it's it's crazy the amount of
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:26.800]   Or the level of homeopathic dose that you're adding and then so we we can't recommend it for that because it would be just
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.920]   Too strong and you would always have someone like
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.680]   Roman look at it and
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.240]   see, you know, is that still okay to take then or
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:42.920]   so we can't recommend that so for something like that I'll take the quantum block and
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:52.860]   Then for creating quantum frequency medicine, it's sort of the same thing. So if if someone wanted to you know charge
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:28:00.000]   Copy the frequency of an ibuprofen as an example onto a card
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.560]   then
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.560]   Similar things that are just described
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:10.920]   Happen in the infinity block. No, so it's really something if you're interested in these types of use cases
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.840]   Then you would want to have a quantum blog and that's why, you know
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:19.400]   Some people have a quantum blog and if it's okay, that makes a lot of sense now that you explained it that way
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.720]   I didn't think about it that way I was thinking more like oh hey, you know
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.960]   Put yours, you know, you want you buy these things to kind of protect your home
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:30.000]   And or put something in it to broadcast out which I'll talk to you in a second, but okay
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.840]   So that's a really good point again. It's just like the frequencies, right? I mean, you need to really think about what is my objective?
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:42.440]   And then what's the best tool for that? What's the best? Okay, so and when in doubt, you know, that's
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:48.480]   Can I add one thing? Okay. Yeah, so that just comes to mind because we just actually recently had that
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:55.080]   Measured and tested and it seems that a lot of people are familiar with David Harkin
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:00.240]   power versus force a book and also his
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:07.120]   Scale that his consciousness scale that he had created right it. There were also a couple interviews lately
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.920]   out there that you know people have heard and
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.880]   These consciousness levels were
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.960]   Were mentioned at that point. So, you know, what does that mean?
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:24.560]   We don't have to go to depth and iron Mitchell actually mentioned that on our other talk as well. Yeah
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:30.960]   Basically, it's a square from zero to one thousand. That's the his scale that he created in one thousand is pretty much like the
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:36.720]   The infinite, you know, it would be like Nirvana like a Jesus or Buddha
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:43.600]   I think Nirvana and that's how they described it and then you know zero is like a very low consciousness obviously right and
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.440]   And you can you can measure that and so now we had
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.120]   Someone that is very familiar with this and has been
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:30:02.060]   Doing these tests. We asked them. Okay. So on that specific scale. What is the the consciousness level of the quantum block and the infinity block?
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.960]   And we also asked them to test the
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:12.480]   Fourth generation infinity blocks. So it came out the quantum block was it five or is it five hundred seventy one?
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:17.560]   The infinity block basic at seven hundred and thirty three, which is already
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:24.440]   Amazing. It's it's very very high of people that are familiar with this. They they'll be stunned and
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:30.360]   The fourth generation. Yeah. Oh, sorry. It's a quantum of five hundred seventy one
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.240]   five hundred seventy one
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:38.880]   So there's a there's a company called FLF E out there. I think
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.200]   That don't use these devices, but they they use a
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.200]   Technology that does similar things. They don't
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:55.760]   Provide it like you can't get it, but you can you can send them like a picture of you or an object so that they put it in
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.720]   Right, and so they can also create these fields and they create a field of
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:05.240]   consciousness field of five hundred and sixty. That's what they create
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.760]   And so the quantum block has a field of
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.880]   five hundred seventy one and the infinity block is seven hundred and thirty three
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.920]   Okay, and the infinity block the fourth generation
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:24.640]   nine hundred and forty two Wow, that is very very high and
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:30.160]   Then you can you know if the people that are familiar with this they can now probably
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:37.160]   Already draw some conclusions on what's becoming possible and you know
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:43.920]   If you start really working more with intentions for example, like what's what's actually possible with that?
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:51.120]   Okay, so I want to point out that this is based on the work of David Hawkins and his consciousness level
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:58.600]   That he came up with and in the book. It's called power and force or something like that right or something like that
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:04.120]   I think yeah, Paul was this for our okay, so okay, and then they've actually measured it, okay, so
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:10.560]   Put a link in the description for anyone who wants to learn more about this because Luke's story
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:19.080]   Just recently interviewed those guys from that the company you just mentioned I think five FIF E or something like that
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:24.000]   Who have the ability to measure this stuff based on the work of David Hawkins?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.680]   So and also they did I think they're calling their device or their technology like Tesla
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:37.760]   Quantum something, but yeah, okay, but yeah, so this is fascinating. Okay, so this really really appeals to my my tinker
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.120]   Okay, no, this is good. So so again, I mean really again
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.360]   So you know if you're out there and you're thinking I want to accomplish X
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:50.640]   Should I get this one or that one then really that's really where you would decide which one to do?
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:56.240]   And then in this scenario as well. It goes beyond the size of the field
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.280]   And it also drills into so think about the size of the field
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:05.360]   But then also think about what do you want to do with that device and how do you want to use it?
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:11.160]   So very good advice and then so that kind of ties to this other one, which is using frequencies with blocks
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:17.720]   So one of the things that you had mentioned in the past was don't leave
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:21.680]   Anything in the block too long, right?
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:26.320]   But then but then my question to you was well if I want to let's say, you know
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.680]   Like I have an infinity block or you know, I have a quantum block as well
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:35.520]   But let's say I want to put the you know the DNA and cell protective frequency, right?
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:43.280]   In my quantum block and I want to just leave it in there permanently so that everything within the field or everything in my home
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.120]   You know is always being protected from that stuff, right?
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:53.160]   But then you were saying that if you leave something into long, it's not a it's there's an issue
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.160]   So could you kind of elaborate on?
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.720]   You know like how do you want how do you use frequencies with these blocks?
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.600]   So that you could take any one of these frequencies, right?
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:09.800]   And then put it in the field so that everything in the field would be exposed to the frequency and
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:14.200]   Then so that's that's the you know, that's to me is the like that's what I want to do
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.640]   That's my objective, but what are the cautions and what would you say?
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:21.000]   How you know, what's the best way to go about doing that? I guess is my question. Yep
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:29.640]   Two things the first thing is if you put a frequency in then do it with the intention that you want that frequency to you know
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.640]   Be transmitted throughout that field and then that will happen
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:39.520]   That that's how to do it and then the question is, you know for how long can you leave a
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:45.920]   Card in there for example, and so with the quantum block. It's not really a problem
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.920]   You could leave it in there for longer
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:53.240]   But even there we we we suggest if you want to use it just for the purpose of
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:35:01.840]   The frequency trans be transmitted across the home and maybe you want to do that for 24 hours or maybe even a whole week
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.960]   then
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.640]   And then that applies even more so for the infinity block because if you leave a card
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.600]   any metal in there for too long it's
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:20.440]   it gets too strong and too powerful and then it there is also a permanent or or
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.480]   potentially
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.200]   class I a permanent connection to this quantum space
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:33.840]   Established and if you then take it out and you were to put it into a lower level infinity block or in your quantum block
[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.120]   You would upgrade those but that's not an intention, right?
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.920]   That's not what you want to do if you have a quantum block and infinity block
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:49.720]   You do not want to upgrade your quantum block because you want it exactly at the level it is because it's exactly designed designed for those
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.000]   use cases that we
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.320]   Mentioned before and then you couldn't perform those any more in that sense. So that's why
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:03.200]   We say don't leave any metals in the infinity block for too long. Okay, and the
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:10.880]   the nice way to go about this though is what you do is you just copy the frequency of which
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:16.040]   ever frequency card you want into aluminum foil and then
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:21.480]   You can put that card away or you put it in your pocket and lever it to that way and
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:26.700]   You take a piece of the aluminum foil and put it into the block
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:31.080]   In order to be transmitted right and then you know
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:36.760]   If you leave that in there for three four five days and you're done with that that little piece of aluminum foil
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:43.840]   You just throw that away, you know, and and that's fine. And I mentioned that earlier. I think if that ends up on the dump
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:51.680]   Then hey, you know, you have some good energy there on that dump, so you know, there's nothing to worry about it
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.240]   But okay, but that's the way to do it
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:37:00.800]   Okay, so you drive by the landfill a year from now and all the seagulls are just totally chilling because there's like all this inner piece
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:10.160]   You know cuz I'm thinking right like I live in a in a condominium and I was thinking well that you know
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:16.520]   I'll just like put the you know, the D&L cell cell frequency in my infinity block in my entire neighborhood
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:23.500]   You know, we'll be within the field and then subject it to the frequency and it helped them right like quote help heal our planet
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.400]   But you know use foil instead of the card. That's the main concern, right?
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:34.680]   Yes, okay, and hey, there's one thing that just comes to mind that I at least want to mention in regards to those
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.320]   you know, David Hawkins
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.420]   with this consciousness scale, right because
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:45.040]   We are kind of used to think okay, so
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.360]   Highest is always the best and I need to do that
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:54.080]   But hey, you know check in with yourself like where are you at in your life and you know have you been?
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:01.040]   Is this whole world here totally new to you right then you're like hearing about all this like the first time and you just
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:07.000]   Understood that there's more than just the physical material world and you're just getting into this type of stuff
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:14.880]   Then you know, don't start too fast like to go with the quantum book. That's already quite a significant field
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:25.040]   So it doesn't need to be always the strongest the fastest because hey, you know if you're in such a highly concentrated field and you've never
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.720]   been anywhere close to that
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:34.320]   It can bring up stuff also right and you know, you you make it easier on yourself and cells
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.000]   if you if you get their step-by-step and
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:43.360]   Yeah, you can develop relatively quickly with these products and these fields and by using them and being around it
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.720]   Because it's literally pure quantum energy. So it resonates perfectly with with our
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.280]   own bio field, but again, you know, it's not
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:39:01.240]   Don't always shoot for the longest the the strongest right at first. Okay, good good advice
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:06.920]   You know, I'm a guy. So I there's two things that I always want is bigger better power
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:11.480]   And I never redirection so you're right. I got to fight that
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.560]   Okay
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:18.800]   All right, you know, this is and I think we're hitting your and we didn't get through all the questions and we're getting towards your
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:25.720]   Your dead stop. Do you have to go? I mean is or can we just answer a couple of quick questions? We can keep going. It's fine
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:29.160]   Okay, so let's keep going there though is because we went over an hour
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:35.160]   I'm gonna break this into two parts one part will be just about the frequencies and then the other part will be about the FAQ
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:41.720]   So that way it's not too long and people can take a break between the parts, but I'm finding I'm learning new stuff from you right now
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.200]   So I I want to yeah, I'm just really this is great
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:49.360]   And I'm sure that people will also enjoy just kind of a clarification on on some of these FAQs
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.480]   So now we talked about using frequencies with the blocks
[00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:58.200]   And I think the other main question that I'm picking up from the chat is that there's lots of folks that have
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.760]   particular
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.560]   relatives with specific ailments and issues
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:07.040]   And things like that and I and you know because of our you know the disclaimer here
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.120]   We really need to be very very sensitive towards
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:14.320]   You know, this is these are not medical devices. These are wellness devices
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:20.960]   So I want to phrase this and such that you know this whole idea of QE for quote wellness
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:30.520]   What is you know what would be the best overall generic explanation to anyone who says I how my mother-in-law or my mom or my
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:38.200]   Dogger has this X problem will cue you know will you know the heel capsule or the kiwi help them
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:45.520]   I mean, what would you say cuz let me just jump in real quick is that I think I explained to someone the other day in the chat
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:49.840]   That it wasn't about what the malady was and what the issue was
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:56.800]   Specific to the person or the animal that in my mind or my opinion was was that the quantum energy?
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:03.320]   in you know as we discussed there's not the best phrasing but but this energy you know
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:10.200]   brings us into harmony to in an optimal state right to bring us to the most optimal
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.680]   You know state that we can be
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:19.320]   Within our energy being our in our end and also balancing out our chemical processes within our physical bodies and
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:25.720]   Balancing out the bio electrical mechanisms within our bodies because we are a three-part, you know type of being right?
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.960]   We have energy
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:32.840]   Bioelectricity and chemically chemical processes all going on all at the same time that composes who we are
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:39.680]   So I was thinking that it'd be like an entrainment like a tuning fork and that the energy brings you to a state of wellness
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:47.440]   So that irregardless of what was wrong or what the problem was or even an injury that it would basically help you heal
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.000]   It would that be the best interpretation
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.240]   When everybody keep you know cuz we get so many people coming into the chat now
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:42:00.920]   That are saying oh, I have XYZ or somebody has XYZ will this help for them and my answer is as well
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.560]   It will help for anything, you know, it's not any it's not specific to anything
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.920]   We we can't say that it treats anything
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:12.000]   But what it does is it harmonizes you to a point where you know, I mean you go ahead
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.300]   Yeah, I mean what's your what's your answer to that? I?
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:24.600]   Almost feel inclined to not at anything because what you've just said is is a perfect explanation of that and I it's it's all
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.960]   most
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.960]   That we need to just have it stand there because it that's that's pretty much how it works
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:36.520]   Yes, there are a few things that could be added, but I think in essence you you nailed it
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.880]   No cool. Wow. That's awesome. Yeah, okay
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:44.960]   So I want to do want to point out one thing cuz I originally had a different diagram here when Philip and I were talking pre
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:51.800]   Pre-show and I read drew it because he pointed out and I and I realized that when he was telling me this was that
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:57.760]   we are energy beings and within that because I used to think of it like three different circles and we all kind of met in the
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:04.720]   Middle but it's true though, right Phillip is that the if and I think you were saying earlier that you know
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:10.840]   If you had the optimal energy state and there's so few people on the planet that do
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:14.640]   But if you had the optimal state then nothing
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.760]   I mean there would be no other issues. You would never be sick
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:23.360]   You would never have diseases right because your energy level would be you know would be perfect
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:30.120]   Is that would I mean cuz that's really we are literally energy beings first and foremost and everything else is secondary
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:40.200]   Right yes, that is correct and it's something that I know is hard to understand for a lot of people that are they're just very brain focused and
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.800]   That was the same for me
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:49.600]   Absolutely was the same for me when I heard this concept the first time that is such a long time ago, and I just
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:54.800]   I just didn't believe it. I thought that's nuts, right? That's hey no
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:58.520]   I mean I just you know get get you know this guy is sick here
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:03.840]   I just had lunch with that person and and no I'm sick too, but that's that's how I
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:09.920]   Thought at the time that would all come about but I've come to realize that that it's really not the case
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:17.460]   if you know if you get something from someone or from somewhere you get it because
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.240]   you have that
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.120]   Resonance to it and and there's
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:30.280]   There's there can be multiple reasons on why you're you're getting that, but it's it's it's it may be a
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:37.920]   Reason because there needs something that needs to be learned some development that needs to happen or many other reasons
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.440]   right and and we find also that
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.240]   that diseases
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:51.500]   Usually that they can they can often actually be identified already in the energy field before they actually materialize so
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:57.560]   so people like like Roman or or or Agni they they would be able to
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.160]   look at someone and
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:07.280]   See that they're there may be a cancer developing or showing up like in three to six months
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:09.560]   if certain things are not
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.600]   taking care of
[00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:16.920]   by then and and they just literally see that only in the energy body and they
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.040]   Know doctor would be able to see anything yet because it's not
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:26.680]   Physically there yet, and then you can literally go about and work on certain
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.880]   things in the energy system
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.680]   and
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:39.760]   And often has to do actually with our own, you know way of life and how we approach certain things and belief system and all of that
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:48.920]   it's often underestimated what that can do an impact and then yeah things can shift so yeah the the energy is really
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:54.720]   The main and and everything else is is very important though on this level as well
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.220]   So we should never ignore that
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:03.380]   That's pretty much nice though that you're always drawing these you know
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:10.920]   Three aspects, which is which is great, you know, we want to take care of all of them. Yeah, I think in terms of pictures
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.740]   How I communicate so yeah, you know cuz I
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:21.080]   Think there's been you know, I'm just kind of a side question to this idea of wellness
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:28.200]   As opposed to disease and while it and you know, honestly, I mean we've been brainwashed from
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:33.040]   Birth to think that we are chemical beings and we're flesh only
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.720]   But you know if you have a
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.160]   Vibratory frequency your energy field
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:44.480]   And you know, you can you can check out d-pack Chopra and his by books on the human bio field
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.840]   And you know, there's a lot of material on this concept, but we are energy beings
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:53.120]   We have a bio field and if that thing is resonating at pitch perfect
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:58.640]   Frequency then the frequency of a bacterium or pathogen
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:03.800]   Just it just it cannot interact with us because they just you know, it's like a vibrate
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.200]   It's the vibration of that frequency
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:12.300]   So what I'm alluding to though the next question is that there are people that have been asking hey, you know
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:17.000]   If I take the nutritional by if I carry around the nutritional bio base
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:23.760]   You know, you know frequency card by do I need to can I stop taking physical supplements?
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:31.000]   You know save myself a bunch of money. So what's your answer to that because then you've got this whole, you know physical supplements are
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.720]   Part of your chemical body, right?
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:40.160]   But then the nutritional bio base frequency is for your energy body and is it possible to supplement?
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:47.720]   Through energy and then stop dealing with the chemical and you know, all right because there are I think there's people out there that do
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.720]   I mean, what do you think?
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:58.640]   Yes, so the answer is short answers. Yes. I mean there are even people out here on Earth that wondering around that are not eating anything
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:07.080]   So they neither take supplements nor do they eat anything and they beautifully exist. That's something. That's a concept that is
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:15.480]   There's not a lot to read about because I don't think you know, it's a very common noise it wanted that
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:21.760]   that concept even is something that we think about anyway, it's it's possible and
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:28.240]   Well, we don't need to go into that really it doesn't you know apply to the vast majority of the people anyway
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:32.160]   But yeah, it's also possible in that sense to really just
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:36.500]   supplement with frequencies however, that's not
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:40.360]   Possible for everybody and and we find two different groups
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:44.480]   Really one group seems to still maintain
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:49.040]   Or or create even optimal vitamin and mineral levels
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:54.680]   just by using the frequencies and not not actually taking the physical
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.640]   substances or nutrients
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.640]   anymore as such as supplements
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:07.600]   However, there's this other group and I would argue that's the that's a bigger group and I belong to that group frankly as well
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:11.480]   Yeah, that still takes physical supplements, but it is
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:19.580]   Suddenly in a way where it seems that the cells can leverage the supplements
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.600]   way better
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.800]   then
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:31.140]   Without leveraging the frequencies meaning that it's almost as if the bioavailability of the products
[00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:35.160]   Increases and what the cells can take in and absorb and the leverage
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:41.720]   Versus before so I noticed that frankly, then now if I take a liposomal
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:48.720]   Vitamin C that's one of those things that I like to take and and it's just so much more powerful
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:53.760]   after I've started to you know leverage frequencies and and
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:50:00.240]   Sometimes I don't you know also take it. You know, I don't I don't take anything like
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.280]   physical
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:07.920]   Everyday, right? I do resets and all that and I try to rotate a little bit
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.720]   But then you know if if I feel something coming. I mean I rarely get
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:19.160]   Sick on that level really, but if I feel like oh man, I may get a cold or something like that
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.640]   I instantly start doing more vitamin D more
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:30.160]   I put some more vitamin C all that and I noticed that it's just it's kicking in so much faster and it's so much more powerful and
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:34.520]   Yeah, that is something that a lot of people actually have
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.320]   reported
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:41.480]   Yeah, that's that that makes so much sense. I never thought about that, but you're right. You're right. You're right
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:46.440]   So I guess that what I want to leave everybody with the thought is that you know
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:50.120]   We are you know our physical realities and even our in our
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:58.120]   Non-physical reality of what we think we are is comprised of three different things. So your wellness is a three part
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.480]   You know
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:06.800]   And you know thing right and in order to treat yourself or to raise your vibration to health and wellness
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.880]   You need to think about all three
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.280]   And it's not ever gonna be just one
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.600]   so
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:15.640]   When the one thing that I've always dabbled in is bioelectrics
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:21.920]   And I just want to say that if you just go to a person wearing a white coat and they give you chemicals
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:28.600]   And you don't it you don't address the other two you're only gonna get a partial solution, and I'll leave it at that
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:36.600]   Okay, so the last question on the free most frequency one is is you know people are you know come in there
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:39.380]   We jump into the chat and they go I've hurt my knee or hurt my elbow
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:45.320]   You know can I can I use the one of the blocks to help you know to just you know help me
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:52.160]   And and so that kind of comes into the whole idea of body charging and then whole body charging in terms of like you know
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:57.820]   As a tinker you know the first thought I ever had when I heard about the block was I want to stick my head in it
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:06.820]   My intuitive reaction to know the hearing that you created a quantum block was I want to stick my head in it
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:11.920]   I don't know why that was the first thought that popped in my mind and I have since done so and maybe that explains
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:13.760]   Why I'm the way I am
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.760]   so I do want to just talk about
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:21.280]   Charging your body so that everybody's really clear on how to do that
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:25.900]   But then also you know like if I had a part of my body like I hurt my foot
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.720]   So now I we you and I had a chat about this a while ago. I did draw a diagram
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:33.440]   So and you know because there's a whole idea here
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:39.040]   And I think that the thing is is let me just kind of the thing is is that there's a there's a maximum distance, right?
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:47.600]   Between the plates until and then if it exceeds that distance then the field is disrupted right and the field goes away
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:53.600]   So the very first question though is like if I wanted to charge a larger object like my body
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.320]   And this is I just want to make sure these numbers are correct
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:03.040]   As I understand them, but if I want to charge my body, and I have a cube lock
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:10.080]   Then the maximum distance I could separate the plates out this six feet. Is that is that correct? That's the right number, right?
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:17.960]   I would say about seven or eight feet is easily possible. So okay
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.120]   Yeah, that's that that's no big deal
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:27.480]   And we actually then stop testing it after after that. So but yeah, maybe basically what what I would say is that
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:31.920]   There's no human on earth that you can
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:37.920]   That could not fit into the plates, you know, there's no one probably nine feet tall
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.440]   Except for the the giants
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:46.280]   Otherwise if there is one that's listening that's nine feet tall, please reach out and we'll do the test well, you know
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:51.560]   I honestly, I don't think the giants, you know, living in caves do that, but anyway, we'll go. Okay, so now the infinity block
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:56.200]   The thing about the infinity block is you have to keep the three plates together
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.200]   Right and so like and then when Jack
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:06.600]   Newell had a great suggestion on how to keep these together just use a zip tie and you have to keep the nuts in between the plates
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:13.360]   Because you need those gaps still there so then if you took this apart you need to then zip tie all the nuts together
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.760]   On all four corners so you'd have you'd have a plate and a plate, you know a three a triple plate up here and a triple plate
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:25.720]   That would look exactly the same as this except without the rods, right? So if you separate those plates
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:32.800]   What's the maximum distance for an infinity block that you could separate out the plates and then charge anything in between I?
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:40.320]   Actually cannot even say what's the maximum distance is because we haven't tested it to that extend
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:47.680]   But yeah, you can you can easily do the the 15 feet that should be no problem, but so ever we because I
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:51.520]   Think I that's what we tested, but then we stopped
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.320]   Testing the further distances
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:59.000]   Yeah, because we didn't think there's more that you need to do if you want to charge your whole house
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.940]   Take a picture of your whole house and put it inside
[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:06.520]   Leave it in there for two weeks and then you may you know, and if you have a I mean
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:11.120]   Yeah, but that's that's what I would do then at that case, but that's a good idea
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:15.100]   I'm gonna do that next okay, so yeah, cuz I remember this number from a prior interview
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:18.000]   So the minimum is 15 you know that it works for sure
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.480]   Which means you could put the plates on either side of your car garage drive slowly?
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:27.520]   You know through the garage, and you're gonna charge your car, right?
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:32.640]   Okay, all right, so there's there's the idea there and how you can charge bigger objects, so
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:37.080]   Okay, good, and then of course if you take a picture of it, and that's a whole nother subject
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:41.080]   Putting pictures in blocks, okay, so going back to the
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:47.400]   Charging your body now you and I had chatted a while back that the field is
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:53.320]   Distinctly between the plates, so it's a rectangular field. It doesn't bow out
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:56:01.200]   So if anything between the plates is what gets charged right so if I were to like lay down and put the plates head the toe
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:06.400]   Right then this would be the field that would be created between the plates and by the way
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.760]   How how quickly would the the field set up?
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:14.880]   Like what I have to like put that into place and then wait like an hour and then lay down or at the moment
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.880]   I set them up. They're good
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:24.800]   So if if you've already used these blocks before then it's almost it's almost instant
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:31.320]   So maybe maybe just in case like wait a minute or two, but it's it's it's it's it's it's super quick
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:38.720]   Just if it's if it's a new block basically that you want to establish it at first
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:47.040]   and that that can take a few hours until it's fully there and yeah, so it's it's pretty much that way so if
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:55.680]   It's it's that way and it's not that way so what we found if you take a
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:03.600]   Heart metal for example and it's one piece and you have it inside your quantum block
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:08.920]   For it to be charged and it just overlaps a little bit on the side
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:12.480]   It would still cover it because it's it's still it's
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:16.840]   It's it's almost as if it's the task to charge this
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:26.800]   The same thing is with the body. So if you lay in there, yes, you have this rectangular
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.600]   field pretty much but
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:35.360]   All of this so most of the cells of your physical body are
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:39.560]   Exposed then and and are in this field
[00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:44.560]   Actually in this quantum energy space. It's not just a field and
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:50.240]   Most likely because of the instant connection
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:57.160]   That the cells have with each other all of the cells are suddenly
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:03.800]   Benefiting from it and are within this so we've tested this and it's literally if you lay like this
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.440]   You're pretty much all in oh, okay
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:13.440]   If that makes sense even though this is hard to explain no no no okay, so so like okay because this like I have a belly
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.440]   So mine would be like outside the field
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:24.720]   Right and so and so but in that case of like a belly outside of the field because and and or actually
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:29.600]   You know like this thing honestly would be because if you'd be laying on a bed then you'd be like right there
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.760]   I'd be like half your body
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:33.920]   But then but you're saying that that's fine
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:40.200]   It'll still work because it'll you'll still get a whole body charge because if I do this much of my body the rest of my body
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:47.480]   will then and train right the energy field will entrain and and I'll get the experience or I'll get the effect of being my
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:54.040]   Immersing my entire body even though the field is for the spaces rectangular is that so that's right right so nothing to worry
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:57.080]   About absolutely so if you want to do body charging
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:59:02.320]   This is fine even though you might have you might stick out here and there okay
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:07.080]   And then the other thing too though like you and I are saying we're like hey if you just had like I have like one day
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:12.200]   I hurt my knee and I stuck it in my cube lock and I just left it in there like 15 minutes and it really actually helped
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:14.360]   So if you just had like a part of your body
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:18.160]   You could just stick it in there for a few minutes and you would get
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:25.840]   That part right but if I just stuck my hand in that would it affect my whole body because I think Besso showed that it does right
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:29.080]   They tested yes, yes. Yes in our hand. Yes in it
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:34.960]   Okay, so so then it means bottom line is you could charge your whole body like this or you stick your hand in there
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:37.560]   And you'll know your whole body will get the the benefit of it
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:41.480]   And then but however, let's say if I hurt my wrist if I just stuck my wrist in
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:47.040]   Then that's good too right just if I want to just like target a specific area of my body
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:52.680]   Yes, so it seems that if you if you put your whole body in that it's a
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:56.320]   Little bit more powerful in that sense
[00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:58.760]   But if you put your hand in it
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:06.640]   Indeed all of your cells still benefit from it. Absolutely and and your energy system as well by the way, right?
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:12.440]   Yeah, cuz that's kind of what what I want to do is I want to start doing like a like a weekly, you know
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:17.880]   Body church is I actually have a firm because like I said, I dabble right, you know a dabble and bioelectric
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.620]   So I have a big I have a very large
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:25.560]   PMF machine and I do a full body zap every you know once a week to raise my ATP levels
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:30.080]   And then I was thinking well, I should do that in combination with a quantum
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.320]   Zap, you know once a week and just kind of like amp up my my energy level with that
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:40.080]   So I was kind of trying to figure out. What's the base way to do it? So yeah, okay now?
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:47.920]   So there is there's a follow-on question cuz I was having a chat with one of the the members yesterday and I just was wondering
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:53.840]   Is there any detrimental or any cautions that you have about?
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:01:01.440]   Doing a let's say put your head in the queue or the the cue block or infinity block or your whole body
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:08.000]   With like using the cue block versus the infinity block versus an upgraded infinity block
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.800]   Are there any concerns that you and or anything you noticed that you and Roman about hey, you know
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:19.480]   Maybe not leave your head in there for you know 30 minutes or maybe if you have like an infinity block
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:25.480]   You know seventh generation or something, then you know, maybe you shouldn't be using it or anything like that
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.520]   has anything come up like that that you've noticed that maybe
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:34.200]   Something to think about because the one comment that I've only read it was where you said once that you
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:41.080]   Put yourself in the block as you were you weren't feeling well, and it just made you really thirsty. You had to drink a lot of water
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:47.440]   So that yeah, so hi. Yeah, so what do you think? I mean, well, is there any cautions people should know about?
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:57.320]   well in general first thing is always the advice, you know follow you intuition tune in with yourself and just you know feel what is a
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.640]   good time for you and
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:05.240]   Don't think about what is a good time for you feel what is a good time for you?
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:10.440]   Because our brains may be like I'm just gonna do this for an hour now for two hours right away
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:15.560]   And then just want to see what happens. That's one way to go about it, but it's it's better to really ask
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.360]   Your inner voice
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.520]   Your higher intelligence if you will okay
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:26.760]   So what is good and you don't have to have an answer because you can lay in there and at some point you'll get this impulse
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.760]   Okay, but what maybe it's now enough and
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:36.840]   That's the first thing to keep in mind the second thing is that detox effect so physical detox effects can settle in
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:42.560]   Yeah, certainly and then also because this ruling always something
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:47.120]   Promontory happening that when we're in this field so that that
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:54.520]   Often we can't really notice on a physical level or even on an energetic level. There is transformation happening
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.840]   There's shift happening. I mean we can see if you we look under a doctor microscope
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:05.560]   Just just with what happens in the blood so quickly so and that's just one thing that is happening. So
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:12.040]   So maybe you know if you do something like this then make sure you can take a little rest
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:19.940]   Afterwards and drink water all right because of that, but there's yeah, there's other than that. There's there's really nothing a
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:27.680]   Negative no depletion or anything that we have ever noticed whatsoever. It's really just these things to be cautious
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.400]   It's it's and it is a real quantum energy space
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:37.760]   So it's that definitely different than just laying on a sofa if you're within that space
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:40.680]   Have you heard of anyone sleeping in it?
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:48.360]   Yeah, we had we had actually one person that has left in it and it went really well, but hey
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.320]   That's not anything that I would recommend. I haven't done it myself
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:57.520]   But I may actually test it at some point and it may be awesome, but you know we also want to be
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:04.520]   Mindful of that so that if someone is already quite tuned in and they they know for themselves
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:10.400]   You know they can do this and they've experimented enough. Hey go for it, but I can't officially
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.000]   Recommend that you know I've you know I've taken
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:21.680]   I've actually been I had my picture in the infinity block once for the whole night because I forgot to take it out
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.800]   That was actually pretty cool
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:31.600]   But also if you just got an infinity block new then don't try it, you know, you want to get used to it as
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:38.160]   I've done it many times. I know I you know as a tinker. I actually want to sleep
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.160]   I just will not my whole body, but I want to
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.800]   Sleep with my head in the cube lock just to see what the effect on my dreams is
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.600]   You know, it's one of my things I want to try
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:53.280]   But I also you know like like Enoch in the chat kind of brought up the whole issue like a month or so ago
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.660]   About you know putting DNA or putting a fingernail in the block
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:03.440]   to then using you know through quantum entanglement sending that energy to you
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:10.400]   Through entanglement and so I tried that and I got to say that I put a fingernail into my cube lock
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.880]   and I literally had this like
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:19.320]   Six cents intuitive thing where I could feel the energy flowing into me even though the cube lock was in the other room
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.440]   So it was kind of a weird thing. So, you know, that's something
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:29.560]   I mean, what do you think about that? You know this whole you know quantum entanglement using DNA a DNA sample like a fingernail and
[01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:33.320]   Putting that in the block instead of a picture right or with the picture
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:40.520]   Yeah, but just being able to then transmit that energy into you directly into your DNA and you're picking it up
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:45.640]   Because you know like you're an antenna. So I mean is that something that you've been it definitely works
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:53.280]   Oh, yeah, okay, hundred percent works what we just don't know yet just because we haven't tested it is okay
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:57.000]   Is any of these two things?
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:03.680]   Stronger or better to do all of all of the quantum entanglement tests and studies that
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:12.040]   We've performed and others have performed with our products. I have been with photographs. So we we don't have
[01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.560]   any such data in
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:19.080]   regards to DNA that's just something on the horizon probably in the next couple of weeks
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:23.240]   We'll do a few tests in regards to that too to also tell people hey
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:29.040]   It's actually exactly the same or hey, you know, this works a little different this may work better with this
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:34.160]   So we'll come up with that information as we have it, but but it does work. We know that so cool
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.440]   That's awesome. Okay. So then the whole issue about charging your your head or whatever
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:44.560]   Cubally a QB versus IB. It's all about the strength and the higher vibration
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:51.200]   So if this is new to you, you probably don't want to stick your head in infinity block just yet, you know, right?
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.920]   And so just take it just in other words take it slow everybody
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:07:00.600]   But you know but there are some very interesting results coming from people who are doing it and obviously I will share with you
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.480]   What happens when I sleep in it so but yeah, that's this is this is really cool
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.200]   I mean it really isn't you know, and let me just you know this gotten so long
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.760]   I'm gonna break it out into individual questions, but I want to add something
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:15.600]   I was telling Philip the other day about putting my fingernail in the block
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:20.440]   And I just want to share this with you and I would love to hear if anyone duplicates this
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.600]   Weird little thing that happened to see what happens to you
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:28.560]   But as I was telling Philip the other day when I had my fingernail in the in my cue block
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:33.080]   I forgot about it, and it'd been in there for like a week, but meanwhile, you know
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:37.760]   I live with two dogs my two dogs, and I I later found my cue block
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:40.720]   We had been kind of like a whole bunch of dog hair had floated into it
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.860]   And so I don't know maybe like for five or six days
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:46.880]   My cue block was sitting there
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:51.840]   With my fingernail in there plus a bunch of dog hair from my two dogs
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.320]   And the funny thing is and Philip you maybe can comment on why you don't want to mix
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:02.160]   People you know like don't put two people in the block at the same time pictures, right or DNA
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.560]   But what I wanted to share though is that that week with my dogs
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.160]   You know how you live with your dogs, right?
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:12.680]   But it's like that when we were blended into the cue block together our DNA
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.680]   I swear to God that my I
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:21.240]   Was bonding like with my dogs they were more cuddly there were more attentive to me
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.240]   I was like more attracted to them
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:28.840]   I mean like I wanted to pet them more often and it was just weird like I was thinking to myself like like where I was thinking
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:31.200]   Why am I really bonding with my dogs this week?
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:36.160]   I went away. Is it a full moon or whatever and then I found the cue block? Oh my god, you know, I
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:44.080]   Cuz the one thing the boy says is don't put two people in there or they'll their frequencies will blend together and sure enough
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.920]   It's like that way. It was just it was just really weird
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:55.360]   But I was like I got really close to my dogs, and then I discovered that is our DNA was being mixed together in the cue block
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.760]   And and this is a true story
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:01.600]   It was just the weirdest week because when I cleaned the I finally cleaned all the dog hair out of the cue block
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.280]   And I took my fingernail out then we all went back to normal where they pretty much ignore me until they're hungry, right?
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:10.360]   And then I was like that that was so is so I'm like, okay
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:14.040]   I gotta try it again just to see if I could duplicate it, but so okay, so why
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:22.320]   So is so is that something people should be really aware of is when you're charging yourself either with a picture or a DNA or a body part?
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:26.600]   That you know what happens when you put someone else in the block with you
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:33.560]   Is am I the first person that so blended with my animals and then we bonded really weirdly? I
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.800]   Mean what's your what's your take? Oh?
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:44.400]   Yeah, no, I mean it I can totally relate to that and that makes absolute sense and it's it's
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:50.440]   somewhat a great experience in story also, so I think that's great that you're sharing that and
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:57.320]   In general, we just tell people don't mix it like you would also not want to mix
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.120]   different objects together
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:05.120]   hmm because indeed energies can commingle and
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:10.240]   You know, then you you commingle stories you commingle
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:18.840]   topics and you know, you may put a person in their mail and then some random female and then you know, they
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:26.720]   Maybe they'll fall in love. I mean that this is something that can happen that doesn't need to happen, but but but could happen and
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:37.360]   It's just because of these things and some unknown factors that because it would yield it would take further testing
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.840]   We recommend to just not do that
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:45.940]   You know with with the dogs. I think it's in general fine. We know that it's also fine with
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:55.000]   like putting a whole family in or a couple if both parties or all parties are fine with that then hey
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:00.680]   That's also no big deal, but you know, I wouldn't put you know two different
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:05.840]   random people in there. It's it's just something where
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.120]   indeed, you're you're commingling
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:11.800]   frequencies and
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:17.360]   Yeah, you know with with your dogs. That's a different. Sorry. That's that's your family in a way also, right?
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:22.000]   Yeah, my dog is belongs to our family and you're so close anyway
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:29.120]   And and that may actually be a great experience as well as it may be a great experience for a couple to actually know, you know
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:34.320]   There's no couple on earth that doesn't have issues right in their relationship
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:39.200]   I you know, I don't think that exists right because we that's also how we grow and
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:45.240]   You know, so yeah, maybe you know that there we have found actually that
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.160]   it it could
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:50.000]   have
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]   therapeutic
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.600]   Or add support in that sense, right?
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:01.400]   You know again, it's it's hard to tell what the outcome is of these things, but there's
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:09.040]   there's consciousness. There's quantum energy added to what whatever story is going on in a relationship and
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:15.920]   It's it may bring up stuff. It may solve stuff. It may help work through stuff or calm things
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.080]   That's that's really what people need to look at together
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:26.600]   But it's something definitely worth trying. Hey if you're a couple and you have one of those blocks and you feel like hey
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.200]   You know, this is something we want to try then go ahead and try that right?
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:37.780]   It's just it just needs the buy-in of both people because you don't want to you know, step on over anybody's boundaries
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:45.200]   Yeah, no, it's yeah. That's a very fascinating aspect towards body charging either through
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:51.160]   photo physical or DNA sample, you know, it's just it was just the weirdest experience
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:55.480]   Were my dogs all of a sudden were more cuddly
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:59.560]   You know because they you know how dogs are they like ignore you sometimes
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:04.840]   But yeah, that was interesting. So we're to the wise experiment carefully
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:12.720]   And make sure that nothing like, you know, I mean, you know, I always think of that movie the fly right where the little flag gets into the transporter
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:16.440]   You know, so you got to be careful what fall, you know
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:20.280]   Like so keep an eye on your cube like what you're doing this and don't let anything fall in there
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:25.840]   You don't want in there, but you know, so it's just something else to think about but yeah, thanks
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.920]   That was a great, you know, great answer. Thanks for your time
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:33.560]   I'm so sorry to I'm to try not to you know suck up all your time, but I have so many questions for you
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:39.840]   But you know, thanks Phillip so much for today that answers the five top FIQ's
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:43.440]   About you know that I'm picking out of the queue and maybe you know
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:50.440]   I don't know in the future will pick another five and if you folks find this helpful, please let us know in the telegram
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:53.720]   Check group and you know because we're trying to put out more user
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.480]   Information and user guides and things like that to help people understand
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:00.680]   The technology the frequencies and how to use them
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:06.880]   So let me wrap it up by saying thank you everyone especially. Thank you Phillip. I really appreciate your time today
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:12.160]   Now if you want to reach Phillip definitely or me you can definitely find us in the quantum power group on telegram
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:19.480]   All the links will be in the description below. Of course layla quantum tech is the you just have this you just redid your website
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:26.320]   So it looks really nice. This is the new website. So it's looking pretty good right here. So and yeah, this is great
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:31.360]   I love the new look. So that's new websites out there. And of course, I'm Kay Elmer
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:37.700]   I'm at the Tinkers Academy and the link will be below. That's my blog and then of course this YouTube channel
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:40.620]   So but yeah, thank you very much Phillip any any parting words
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:43.920]   Anything else you want to let the users know?
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:51.240]   Well, thank you first of all for your time. This has been great and and I feel yeah, you're totally right
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:56.320]   It was also necessary because there are always these questions and I'm I'm glad we've taken the time
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:03.600]   So for this and and and answered those hopefully it was helpful for for many people. Yeah, maybe just
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:09.780]   Just another Tink because you mentioned you wanted to put your head into the cube lock while you
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:17.280]   While you sleep you know people out there can this maybe start with a test when you take a nap
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:24.080]   but maybe if you usually don't take a nap maybe just pick a day where you would like to take a nap and take your time to do that and
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:30.920]   Then put your put a picture of you a current picture of you inside your quantum block or your infinity block
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:33.600]   While you're taking that nap
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:40.840]   And then you know maybe experiment with that and see how that does so I've I've had some good results
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:46.680]   I rarely ever take naps, but I've tested this and I've I've had great results
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:52.040]   Actually, some really deep relaxation that came out of it doesn't mean that it is the same for you because you know
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:57.560]   We all are different and have all our different issues, but but hey that will be a
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:02.760]   Good way to start a good idea without having to physically put it in yeah
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:03.640]   No a great idea
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:04.040]   Thanks
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:08.680]   And and by the way if anybody does any of the crazy stuff that we're talking about you know in terms of
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:14.000]   You know just testing out things and trying new things and hey, please let us know what happens, right?
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.320]   I mean we have this telegram chat group all about the quantum energy and and Leila and and so you know
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.960]   Hey, if you if you if you try any of this stuff
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:29.320]   Please share it with the rest of us. That's how I learn. That's how we find out what works and what doesn't work
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:34.400]   And and so I'm always always always always very happy that people will come in there and share
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:39.120]   Some of the experience and if one for Enoch we wouldn't even have started doing all the DNA stuff
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:44.520]   So, you know, hey, thank you Enoch and thank you everybody out there for participating. So yeah
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.560]   I'm gonna go ahead and stop the recording now
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:51.320]   I'm gonna break this up and publish this here and in the next day or so and and we'll get it all going
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:56.400]   So thank you Phillip really appreciate your time. Aloha everybody. Thank you, K
