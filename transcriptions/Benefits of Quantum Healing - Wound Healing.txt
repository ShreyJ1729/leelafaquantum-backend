[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another tinker's academy video. I'm your host Kaelmer and this
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.360]   video is another installment in the video series benefits of quantum healing where I have been
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.400]   documenting the results of independent third-party studies commissioned by Leila Quantum Tech to
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.320]   understand the effects of quantum energy on various biological systems. This particular video
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.640]   covers a report that just was released April of 2024 on the effects of quantum energy on wound
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.680]   healing. The principal investigator of this study is Dr. Robert Joseph Chief PhD. He is an associate
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.400]   professor of biochemistry at the University of Tulsa. His research focuses on discovering and
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.280]   characterizing novel therapeutic drugs from synthetic libraries and natural products. His area of
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.840]   expertise is in cancer biology, cell metabolism, cell cycle, chemotherapeutics and drug screening.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.160]   A link to his bio at the University of Tulsa is available in the video description below.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.080]   Now onto the study. The study is titled "Investigation of Quantum Upgrade and its Effect on Wound Healing."
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.040]   The abstract is very clear as to what the focus has been for this study which was,
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.440]   "We have posed the question of whether or not controlled quantum interactions would have a
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.040]   positive effect when applied consistently to a biological system. For the purpose of determining
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.840]   this, we have used the quantum upgrade system and tested it to see if it would alter the rate of
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.120]   wound healing via multiple double-blind experiments. The studies were performed in a biochemistry
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.760]   research laboratory at the University of Tulsa under the direction of associate professor Dr.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.600]   Robert Chief PhD. They were structured to measure and quantitatively assess rates of cellular
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.960]   confluence achieved with and without the influence of a quantum field modulator, the quantum upgrade
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.440]   service. The results are nothing less than absolutely remarkable. The results show that there was a
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.440]   significant increase in the rate of healing across all experiments. There was a range of variability
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.120]   between all five of the experiments that were performed over a span of 12 months. The rates of
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:07.040]   wound healing were increased by 45.8 percent on the lower end and by 100 percent on the higher end
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.720]   of the data sets across the whole study which includes five experiments over the course of 12
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.360]   months. The study design was quite straightforward. The duration was 12 months. The frequency of
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.800]   observation was several times per day. The sample size was tens of millions of cells.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.880]   The cell types were human dermal fibroblasts and the treatment group which was HDF cells
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.640]   were exposed to the quantum upgrade system which serves as the intervention and the control group
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.080]   was HDF cells not exposed to quantum upgrade system maintaining standard conditions. So what
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.040]   that is was basically creating all these different trays of human cells, putting them together and
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.920]   then separating them. One group was not exposed to quantum upgrade. The other group was and the
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.760]   results are the comparative analysis between the two groups. The goal of the study was to compare
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.080]   the rate at which the uncharged and charged human dermal fibroblasts cells closed a scrape which is
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.320]   the simulation of a wound in a confluent monolayer of cells. So in other words they had a layer of
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.080]   human cells. They would scrape the cells creating an artificial wound and then they would measure
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.000]   the rate at which that scrape was closed by the cells themselves. They would basically heal the
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.280]   wound and so the cell development that would close the wound was what was measured. The method methods
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.720]   here in the study was they just basically create different plates. They would label them and the
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.560]   data acquisition that they used in order to determine the effects of quantum energy on the cells
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.880]   was they used phase contrast images that were captured at a 20x magnification on an icon eclipsed
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.560]   TI inverted microscope and saved as JPEG files. All images were obtained under the same parameter
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.000]   settings on microscope software variables such as brightness, magnification, image intensity,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   etc. So let me show you kind of just you know it's kind of like it's not something that I can
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.160]   interpret but if you look at the study right here which is I'm paging through I kind of just show
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.960]   you what the pictures look like. So here basically are the different groups the different groups that
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.200]   were just subjected to and then I'm not subjected to and then subjected to the quantum upgrade service
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.480]   and the pictures were and saved as JPEGs and then they're all included here in the study showing
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.920]   that rate of growth of the cells in IE you know simulating wound healing the ones that didn't
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.880]   get it and the ones that did and I'm like again I'm not a biologist so I can't really interpret
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.000]   the picture but the results from the biochemists was that there was a lot more cell growth in the
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.080]   groups that were treated by the quantum upgrade service which indicates the activity of wound
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.680]   healing so this is what the pictures look like in the study. At the end of the day the summary
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.600]   of findings in the study were over the span of 12 months multiple double-blind experiments were
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.200]   conducted. The results revealed a significant increase in the rate of wound healing across all
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:15.680]   experiments the rates of wound healing varied with an approximate increase of 50 percent at the low
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.360]   end and up to 100 percent at the higher end of the data sets. To be more concrete the first two
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:28.000]   experiments showed a wound healing acceleration of 85 to 100 percent. The last experiment showed an
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.680]   acceleration of wound healing of 45.8 to 79.82 or 79.2 percent. Analysis of the experimental data
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:42.240]   showed clear evidence of wound closure progression over time with noticeable differences observed
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.160]   among the plates and experimental conditions. Specifically plate number two exhibited the fastest
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.440]   closure of wounds in that specific experiment followed by plate number four. Plates number one
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.560]   and plates number three showed slower rates of closure with open spaces still visible at later
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:05.120]   time points. If you read the details of the study it basically summarizes the various time frames
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:12.080]   each one of these plates were measured at where they determined the rate of wound closure and it
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.120]   went from anywhere from 24 hours to 48 hours. So for those of us who are using the quantum
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.920]   upgrade service we can expect to most likely experience the same results at a minimum of 48
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.480]   hours with the quantum upgrade service turned on. Now this was just a quantum upgrade service
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:36.960]   without any of the frequencies applied. So folks this is an unbelievable study done by a very
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.040]   highly you know reputable professional in in his field that demonstrates that using quantum
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:50.160]   energy will accelerate wound healing will help your body heal wounds and that is what is amazing
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.720]   about this study. So that's it that's a quick summary of the study. I want to thank everyone
