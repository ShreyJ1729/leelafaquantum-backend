[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.840]   Elmer and this is a tutorial on how to make a quantum capsule using the Lele
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.760]   Cube lock. A friend of mine today asked me how to go out about making them and
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.040]   links to supplies and things like that and I thought I would just whip up a
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.160]   quick video tutorial to show him and also anyone else that's interested in how
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.720]   to go about making your own. So you know if you go to the website the primary
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.920]   capsules that are available on Lele Cube website right now are for Heel and the
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.280]   men's booster and the woman's booster but if you wanted to make a capsule of
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.640]   let's say the weight loss frequency, the cell and DNA protection frequency, the
[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.840]   unity, prosperity, abundance and other types of frequencies then you know by
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.720]   all means you can make your own and but the only caveat is you're gonna need a
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.440]   cube lock or an infinity block to do so and that's it for those of you who own
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.120]   these this is the instructions for you. Okay so the main thing that I've learned
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.280]   over time is that the best practice is really my best tips for you is just make
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.280]   a neutral capsule and all of my capsules right now because I haven't
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.320]   switched to this way of doing things but all of my capsules right now are
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.920]   frequency specific meaning I put the frequency in the capsule itself but you
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.640]   know going forward though I'm actually gonna be making just one neutral capsule
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.680]   and adding frequencies one at a time or taking away using foil instead it just
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.960]   seems it's just a much better way that way I don't end up with like you know I
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.560]   like I have right now I literally have a dozen or more different capsules and I've
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.560]   got him in little baggies with labels and so I don't remember I don't forget
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.600]   which ones are what but you know it is a lot easier I believe going forward if
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.640]   you just had one capsule of neutral frequency and then you can I mean
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.520]   neutral energy and then you could change and swap out frequencies based
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.800]   using the foil so it just makes much more sense to do it that way so that's my
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.160]   my tips for you make a neutral capsule use foil for your frequency you know
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.240]   and then then the main thing though is charging each item separately so you
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.360]   don't blend the frequencies of the items together because if you're using let's
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.240]   say a brass capsule and a titanium sphere you don't want to charge them
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.560]   together otherwise you're gonna have they're gonna mix and you're gonna have
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.240]   you know titanium spheres with brass frequency and so forth so so you just
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.240]   want to keep everything separate so it's nice and clean and it's just stays
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.560]   much more organized now if you do for charging times if you have a cue block
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.360]   then you're gonna want to charge your items separately for three minutes if
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.640]   you have an infinity block you'll want to charge for one minute and it's as
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.400]   simple as that in terms of how fast it goes it goes very quickly now this
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.840]   specific question I was asked was you know what size capsules do I get and how
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.960]   many spheres and what size spheres so I'm gonna walk you through that the one
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.920]   on the left here in the picture is the Leila heel capsule this thing is about
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.800]   four and a half centimeters tall and about one and a half centimeters wide and
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.520]   and so now that's the original one that I got and I found it to be a little
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.640]   large for me you know about in terms of something hanging off them I don't I
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.280]   just I just felt like it was a little large for me and it's a personal
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.560]   preference so when I started making my own I decided to go with this other size
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.480]   capsule and and really I kind of like it it's about four it's about five
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.640]   centimeters tall and about about a one and about a full millimeter I'm sorry
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   centimeter wide and so there's definitely a difference because it's it's
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.720]   narrower right in terms of how many spheres it can hold but I just you know
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.320]   it's a personal preference if you want if you're gonna be making your own I
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.360]   just want to point out that you know you're the size of the capsules up to you
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.920]   also the type of metal you use is up to you now I'm just using brass because
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.600]   when I got the brass heel capsule it really resonated with me up up until
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.040]   then I had tried steel I had tried aluminum obviously I had tried yeah it's
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.400]   other one was steel I forget but I tried a bunch of different metals and I just
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.720]   you know once and but I never tried brass and I really it just feels warm
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.360]   you know this warm vibration from it so I like brass and so but but all mean
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.860]   by all means though you guys can try any kind you want I actually made my
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.880]   daughter I found a capsule that was made out of sterling silver and I filled it
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.540]   full of silver pure silver cut wire as the filler you know and and I gave that
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.840]   to her and she absolutely loves it I tried to give her an aluminum one with
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.220]   titanium spheres and she hated it and so she just didn't you know didn't
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.560]   resonate with her so metal is going to be a very personal thing and so for me
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.920]   I'm just going with brass and so that's that's the concept there so for you
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.000]   know for nomenclature sake this I'm just going to refer to this size as the
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.680]   Layla Q size and this size as a small okay so it's smaller and so that's that so
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.260]   now how many spheres will go into each one of these the Layla Q's capsules will
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.020]   fit five eight millimeter spheres right here so back up it'll fit five eight
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.500]   millimeters spheres and I'll show you where you can get those okay now the
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.780]   small one will only fit four of the eight millimeters spheres and in this
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.140]   in this example of actually I'm actually using brass spheres it's just kind of
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.560]   one of my tanks I wanted to see what a brass sphere brass capsule felt like
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.420]   you know and I actually really like it but it only will fit four because it's
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.560]   much more narrow I mean in terms of the cap on this puppy comes down to about
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.200]   here so it really cuts off the space so you can fit spheres however I do have
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.360]   four millimeters spheres of titanium on hand and the Layla Q spheres are
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.920]   titanium by the way and so I have titanium spheres in four millimeter size
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.680]   and I did discover that you can fit up to six of those also inside of one of
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.920]   these small so it's either going to fit four of the eight millimeters spheres
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.600]   or it's going to fit six of the four millimeters spheres so those are your
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.360]   kind of your choices there so you know completely up to you what size spheres
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.640]   you want to put in there but just to kind of give you an example if you pick
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.640]   this size of capsule then this is how many spheres of that size are going to
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.880]   go in it alright so that's that and I'll show you here in the second where to
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.160]   get the supplies now so basically the steps are really very simple one just
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.040]   charge the capsule charge the spheres two three charge create a frequency
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.320]   foil and then wrap that foil around one of the spheres to add a frequency to the
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.680]   neutral capsule and boom you've got it so let me kind of just walk you through
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.560]   it I just did a really quick cell phone video just to sort of demonstrate so as
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.480]   an example let's say this is an empty sphere our capsule put it in the cue
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.800]   block three minutes you're good to go that thing is now charged with neutral
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.400]   quantum energy then the next thing you want to do is take your spheres and
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.600]   always be sure to you know I use the paper towel because they're gonna roll
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.000]   away I guaranteed so you put your spheres in there and then you want to
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.720]   charge your spheres put them in there for three minutes and then take them out
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.520]   and then you're done so now you've got spheres and a capsule they didn't blend
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.520]   with each other and they now fully charge quantum energy and you can just
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.960]   wear that that's just pure quantum energy and it actually has quite a bit of a
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.400]   benefit if you look at some of the test results now if you want to create a
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.640]   frequency you want add frequency to it you take a substance and that's just an
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.800]   example of a substance and a little tiny piece of foil that's it you put it in
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.360]   there for three minutes and the molecular frequency of the substance will
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.200]   transfer to the piece of foil and now you've captured that frequency of the
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.720]   of the substance and in you've now got it on to the foil now you can take that
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.920]   little pill or whatever you still can you can still ingest it okay by the way
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.080]   it's perfectly fine so now you've got the foil the foil holds the frequency and
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:28.160]   then you take one of your spheres and you wrap the foil around the sphere okay
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.080]   and that's it and that's and then you put all the spheres back into your capsule
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.360]   and you're done and you basically have now taken a neutral capsule and you've
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.680]   added a frequency to it now if you decide in the future that you want to
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.120]   change out the frequency you just take the foil off add another piece of foil
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.440]   that you've charged with something else and now you've changed this you you have
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.960]   one standard capsule that you can mix and match for all the times kind of like
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.880]   them back in the day right those mood rings where you can just change the
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.360]   different colors and so that's how you do it and now you can instead of the now
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.040]   one other thing I wouldn't caveat is that let's say you don't you don't want to
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.960]   use a substance you actually want to use one of the frequency cards that you
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.320]   bought same exact concept you put the frequency card into the cube lock with
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.800]   the piece of foil and now the frequency on the card has transferred to the foil
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.120]   and then that's how you add it to your neutral capsule and that's it and then
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.800]   you've got yourself you know a now you've got a quantum capsule with whatever
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.000]   frequency you've desired so now I'm gonna kind of walk you through the
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.240]   different websites eBay is where I'm gonna put all the links in the video
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.800]   description below for you so here you go this is eBay now this the link for eBay
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.160]   is gonna be to this it's it's actually three different ones and you want to
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.920]   order the the medium one is the one I was showing which is the Lele Q size and
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.080]   it's only 899 free shipping okay so you want to get a medium size brass capsule
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:57.480]   which will be the Lele Q size capsule 899 okay now if you want to get the
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.480]   smaller one and create your own smaller ones they're only $3 each or $3.09 each
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.040]   and here's the website or the eBay listing for that and so you can get that
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.320]   size one for for the smaller ones if you decide to go with that size and then
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.720]   to get these titanium spheres I believe it or not this is one of the rare you
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.160]   know it's the only place I can find in the US it's crazy it really is the only
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.640]   site I can find in the US it sells it there there's a couple of industrial
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.160]   sites but they're in Europe but anyway so it's simple just go to Etsy go to this
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.320]   website they sell titanium spheres okay and you have to select the option so
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.640]   right here is your drop down and so now if you want the four millimeters sphere
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.420]   it's a translates to 530 seconds of an inch and so you get a 10 pack right for
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:48.800]   whatever so if I were to click that a 10 pack of four millimeters spheres would
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.000]   go 842 so I could you know I need six right I'm sorry and yeah they're four
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   millimeters so I need I would need six of those puppies and so then I would buy
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.480]   a 10 pack of that now if I decide to go with the eight millimeters spheres which
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.680]   is 5/16 of an inch or 7.99 close enough right and if I pick that puppy then a
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:11.360]   10 pack right 10 pack of these eight millimeters spheres are gonna go for
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:17.280]   1467 so it's relatively inexpensive you know the the the value of it's the
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:23.200]   actual frequency right and and the effort in and into making these things in in
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.520]   bulk but this is how you do it for yourself if you own a cue block or an
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.480]   infinity block that's it that's how you make them so thank you very much for
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.440]   this watching this video I hope this tutorial was helpful if you got any
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.320]   questions come on down to the to the you know the the power well the what
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.120]   quantum power group on telegram where you can ask all the questions you want
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.120]   on anything you need to do as it relates to lay the cue you can go to lay the
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.080]   cue website to get frequencies and the links below again for the supplies there
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.120]   you go and if you want to get a hold of me ask me any questions at all I'm in
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.400]   that chat room all the time where you also can find me at the Tinkers Academy

[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.680]   about any types of frequencies and I hope this was helpful thank you for
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.360]   watching and have a great day aloha
