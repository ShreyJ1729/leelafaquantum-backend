[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinker's Academy video. I'm your host Cammer and in this video
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.080]   I'd like to share with you the research that I've done on the unintended consequences of oral
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.000]   contraceptives for women otherwise known as birth control. I had a unique interest in this from
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.080]   another video I did. I went down a rabbit hole and let me tell you the information that I found is
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.040]   remarkable, fascinating, alarming, amazing. It is just the most interesting thing that I've
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.440]   uncovered in quite a while in terms of just digging into the science behind something or just asking
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.160]   a simple question, "Hey, does it affect us?" and what the answers that I came back with are just
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.000]   truly amazing. So if this is something that's interesting to you or if you are with someone who's
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.960]   on oral contraceptives or have taken them to yourselves, you might want to just take a look
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.960]   at this video. So here we go. Now this is going to be really controversial so I just want to make
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.480]   sure that I put out my disclaimer on this video that this video is for informational purposes only
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.680]   and does not constitute medical advice. The content should not be used to diagnose or treat any

[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.720]   to your health regime or starting any new treatment. The creator of this video, me, I'm not responsible
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.880]   for any actions taken based on the information provided. Also, just please understand that to
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.960]   follow is a theoretical analysis of the impact of birth control on natural mate selection
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.720]   processes for humans and its unintended consequences. So it's not to be construed
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.360]   as fact. It is my theory and here is the science to back up my theory. So now why did I do this
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.040]   video? Well, I just did a video prior to this one called how to hack body odor.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.480]   And in that video, I went through the science of what creates body odor and how it really
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.000]   reflects your health and then how you could then deal with that naturally without chemicals.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.240]   And so part of the reasoning in that video that I came up with, why body odor is an important
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.440]   factor of health is because what I learned in that video or that research was that our ability
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:27.200]   to smell is a superpower. When you look at what we are able to do from our five physical senses,
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.120]   you know, with vision, we have a very narrow band of the light spectrum that we can see. So it's,
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.360]   we don't see everything. We see a very narrow bit of it. Same thing with hearing, you know,
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.760]   we only have a very narrow band of all the different sounds in the universe that we can
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.640]   literally hear and we can tune into. However, when it comes to smell and taste, we have this
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.800]   unlimited ability to interpret the world with this incredible superpower called smell.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.240]   And so one of the interesting things in that research was that for the longest time up until,
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.760]   you know, about, you know, just literally within the last 10 years, it was thought that our ability
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.440]   to smell was very limited to about 10,000 different odors. And that's what all the textbooks say.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.160]   But in 2017 Rutgers University did a study and they determined that humans could smell up to a
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.800]   trillion different odor that they could detect that many different odors. And that really kind
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.760]   of just really perked my interest on. Okay, now if, you know, the universe, you know, created us
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.120]   biologically through evolution, having this incredible sense of smell, then it must be for
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.680]   something important. And that's where this video comes from. So now I do want to get some terminology
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.600]   out of the way before we get into the science. And this is a common phrase I'll be using throughout
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:53.040]   this video called MHC. And that stands for the major histocompatibility complex. It's an immunologically
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.960]   important group of genes in your genetic genomes that appears to be under natural as well as sexual
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.040]   selection. So in other words, geneticists have identified a portion of your genes in your DNA,
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:13.200]   right, that control your attractiveness to the opposite sex. And they call that major histocompatibility
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.880]   complex MHC. And that's in all mammals, but specifically to humans, it's called HLA. So you'll
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.000]   hear in this video that the two phrases used synonymously, you'll hear MHC, and you'll hear HLA. But
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.040]   that's your section of your genes, it's genetic. And that's what's the most interesting part about
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.360]   the science is that genetics play a huge role in mate selection or the other, you know, people you
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.840]   find attractive. So here we go, let's get into the science. Now it started off, well, this whole
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.480]   issue really kind of started off with a landmark study. It's been nicknamed the Stinky T-Shirt
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.480]   Experiment. But the actual name of the study was produced, it was 1995. And the study was titled
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:08.320]   body odor preferences and men and women. And do they aim for MHC combinations or simple
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:16.080]   heterogusicity? Sorry. Okay, I keep mispronouncing that word anyway. So but bottom line is that
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.160]   this Stinky T-Shirt Experiment 1995 was was done by the Department of Behavioral Ecology
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.720]   from the Zoological Institute in Hinter, Capo, and Switzerland. Okay. What they what they
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:36.320]   wanted to do in that study was they wanted to determine a does smell, right, affect mate selection,
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.720]   and and how, and you know, basically, and how did it affect it in terms of genetics. And so they did
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.520]   this study where they took 121 men and women, and they had them basically smell the odors of six T-shirts
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.200]   worn by two women and four men, right? So the the the people that wore their T-shirts wore them for
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:03.120]   two days, no clone, no soap, just their natural scent, no masking, and they packaged up these T-shirts.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:10.080]   And then they had people, you know, these men and women, 121 of them smell and then rate them on a
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.720]   factor of attractiveness. And so now the scoreings of what they refer to as pleasantness correlated
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:24.240]   negatively with the degree of MHC similarity between smeller and the T-shirt wearer in men and women
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.080]   who were not using contraceptive pills, and then which was a side thing that they discovered
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:36.640]   during the study. I'll kind of I'll go I'll explain this. It's it's you know, the wording is was
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.640]   pretty tricky on this one. So in other words, what they did was they had a bunch of people smell
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.480]   other people's T-shirts and rate them on whether or not they were, you know, attracted to the person
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.880]   or that smell that they smelled on the shirt. Okay, and then they went and they they took a look at
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:57.680]   the the six people and their genetics. They looked at the 121 and their genetics in terms of MHC,
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.160]   right? And so we all have different genetics in terms of MHC genetic profiling. We're all different,
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.040]   okay? And they discovered, right, that first of all, what was interesting, one of the highlights
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.240]   of the study was that there was no apparent effect of gender. So irregardless of gender,
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:20.080]   whether it was men smelling the T-shirts for women, right, or women smelling the T-shirts of men,
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.600]   it didn't matter. It was both the same thing that they were both driven by this attraction,
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.560]   and the attraction was the MHC similarity and dissimilarity. So what that meant was that men and
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:38.800]   women who were reminded of their own mate and ex mate when sniffing a T-shirt had significantly
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:48.000]   fewer MHC or MHC allies in common with this T-shirt wear than expected by chance. So it was mathematically
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.480]   and statistically sound in terms of their results, which suggested that MHC or linked genes
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:00.560]   influence mate choice. So that was their first question. Does the person's genetics affect your
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.600]   attractiveness to the opposite sex? And the answer was yes. And then they went and looked at,
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:14.560]   okay, what is it about that? What about that other person's genetics makes you attractive to them.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:20.640]   So what they discovered was people who are different than you are the ones you're attracted to,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:27.760]   naturally. And if they're the same as you genetically, you're not attracted to them.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:33.680]   So it's a little bit backwards, right? So different is good or different is natural order of things.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.480]   People are attracted to different people that are different than them and not attractive to
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.120]   people who are. But what they discovered in this study, when they looked at the women, there's like
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:50.640]   49 women in this study, they discovered something really unique. And that while the overall arching
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.920]   group of people who were not taking oral contraceptives, all of the men and half the women,
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.440]   right, they were not taking oral contraceptives. And so they all behaved a certain way. But the
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.400]   ones that were taking contraceptives didn't behave like the rest of the group,
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:13.440]   they behaved in a way where they were choosing people who were similar to them, which was the
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.200]   opposite of the, let's say, the control group who were not on contraceptives. So in other words,
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:25.280]   in pill using women, the correlation between odor, pleasantness, and the degree of similarity on the
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:32.800]   MHC, or MHC tended to be again reversed. So now a little graphic here to kind of help everybody
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.280]   understand this. This is really important to the whole discussion is that when you look at,
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:43.280]   and this is what the study proved, okay, or demonstrated. When it comes to natural genetic
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:49.600]   mate selection in human beings, that the dissimilarity of the genetics, your MHC on your genome,
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:56.240]   when a woman chooses or a man chooses a partner, they're naturally going to choose someone who's
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:01.120]   different than them. And then they would produce, in other words, you would you take two different
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.000]   people with different genetics, you combine them and you create a third group of genetics
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.600]   in your offspring that are genetically stronger than you. It's evolution, folks, right? This is
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:18.240]   evolution. You find someone who's dissimilar, for genetically from you, you basically produce
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:23.840]   offspring, and your offspring becomes stronger than you two individually,
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:29.760]   to continually, in other words, continue the species. It's all nature here, right? What is the
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:36.400]   primary purpose of life? And that is to reproduce. And what is the whole point of reproducing is
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:42.960]   you want to continually reproduce stronger and stronger genetics for the sustainability and the
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.840]   survivability of the species. And that's just evolution. That's what they discovered, which was
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:54.000]   really cool. But then, this group of people with no contraceptives, they were all behaving this way.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.360]   The people who were on contraceptives, primarily the half of the women, they discovered that they
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:06.480]   didn't have that ability, that they were choosing mates that were similar to them, which would then
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:14.400]   produce offspring that had no genetic, you know, basically no genetic, you know, difference between
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:20.000]   their parents. So they were either the same or they were weaker genetically. Okay, because the
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.960]   whole point of evolution is that we constantly produce stronger and stronger and stronger offspring
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.560]   genetically. But this group of people, this group of women were selecting mates who were similar to
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.840]   them, and thus producing offspring that were similar to them. And so they weren't carrying on the,
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:41.360]   you know, the evolutionary path of creating stronger genetic offspring. And that's what they
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.680]   discovered. Now, I got to tell you, you know, when I was doing all the research, there was a lot of,
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.640]   you know, this came out in 1995, and there were a lot of geneticists and biologists that were just
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.800]   very critical of this study because, you know, they were done by zoologists, right? So they were
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.440]   very critical of it. And so it came under a lot of criticism back then. But since then, there have
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:08.560]   been other studies that have backed up the demonstrated results of this initial stinky t-shirt study.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:14.240]   And so one of the one of those studies was done in 2008 by the University of Newcastle in Newcastle
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:20.960]   UK. And the title of this study was MHC correlated odor preferences in humans and the use of oral
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.680]   contraceptives. Now this group of people at the University of Newcastle decided to, hey, we,
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.640]   you know, is this true? I mean, is it really, is that really happening? And they, in their tests,
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:38.320]   they found a significant preference shift towards MHC similarity associated with pill use,
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.480]   just like the the folks in the nether in the nether that's right. I'm sorry. And so within,
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:50.320]   which was not evident in the control group. So now what they concluded was that odor plays a role
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:57.360]   in human mate's choice. So they confirm that odor, your ability to smell someone's odor can
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.000]   differentiate their genetics. And it's all happening in your brain. You just don't know it. It's
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.840]   part of our genetics. We just do this naturally. And then their results suggested that contraceptive
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:15.840]   pill use could disrupt, you know, disrupt and they made preferences of people who were choosing
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.720]   or women who were choosing their mates. So it said, so they confirmed what they had found out in
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.600]   Switzerland with this other study in 2008 that yeah, that that they actually saw that
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:30.400]   happening in their study as well. And there's more studies in 2009. There's another study,
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.120]   this was a journal article published by the University of Sheffield. And the title was,
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:41.440]   does the contraceptive pill alter mate choice in humans? So in 2009, a year later, another university
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.640]   did the same study. And they have, and basically they looked at everything and they said in their
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:54.400]   study that new evidence suggests that the pill by eliminating the estrus, which is the the hormone
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:00.560]   thing that you women who are pregnant go through. And also when they're on their menstrual cycle,
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:06.000]   when they eliminate those changes, the natural cycling preferences in women for markers of both
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.560]   genetic quality and compatibility and mates, as well as natural cycling attractiveness to men.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:18.320]   So in other words, they confirmed that that was that your ability to smell was a very important
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:25.440]   aspect to being attractive to men. And it was tied to genetics. Now then they went on and looked at
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:31.280]   how does oral contraceptives affect women's natural mate selection process. And whereas
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:40.480]   normally cycling women express a preference for MHC dissimilarity, right, as the natural order of
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.520]   things, you want to have someone who's different than you dissimilar. They discovered in their
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:53.760]   study in 2009 that the pill users preferred odors of MHC similar men, indicating that pill use might
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.840]   eliminate adaptive preferences for genetic dissimilarity. So again, this study by the
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.320]   University of Sheffield confirmed the stinky t-shirt experiment that said, yeah, you know,
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:10.960]   if you take oral contraceptives, you turn off your natural you women turn off your natural ability
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:17.760]   to detect the similarity or dissimilarity in genetics of a potential partner. And then again,
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:23.600]   in 2016, one more study came out. And this was actually a journal article in scientific reports
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:29.440]   titled influence of HLA on human partnerships and sexual satisfaction conducted by the University
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.120]   of Dresden and Dresden, Germany. They basically stated in their paper and their study that they had
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.440]   basically gone through the literature and they had confirmed that fish and birds and mammals
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:45.920]   prefer mates with different genetic MHC code compared to their own. So this was not just humans,
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:52.080]   but it was also all these other studies out there confirmed that life, all life on the planet,
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:58.000]   you know, that's, you know, animals, not plants, but all this life that's mating, they're always
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.080]   going to go, they're always programmed to always go after somebody or something you're made.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:09.680]   That's different than you genetically to produce stronger genetic offspring. So this preference
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:15.200]   in their study, this what they stated in their study was this preference increases the chances
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:21.520]   of high MHC variety in the offspring. And then this is an interesting aspect is, okay, now why
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:26.880]   we do that? Why do why are we biologically wired to do that? And they kind of discovered that it
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:33.680]   leads, there's leading to enhanced resilience against a variety of pathogens. So there's another
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.520]   clue here. So not only are we, are we wired to select dissimilar genetics and mates
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:47.200]   to produce stronger genetic offspring, but that stronger genetic offspring has an advantage,
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:54.400]   right, over non stronger genetic offspring in the ability to have a resilience against pathogens.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.960]   In other words, survival of the species, guys, we constantly, if you follow the natural order of
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:05.760]   things, we produce stronger genetic children who then are going to be stronger against pathogens
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.160]   and be healthier. And that's just part of it, which they tied in the pathogens aspect.
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:16.560]   So then their study was, we show on a large scale, they had all this math in there, that HLAA
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:21.520]   dissimilarity correlates with partnership. They did, so they confirmed it, right, that it does,
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:28.640]   that dissimilarity, right, being different correlates with partnership, sexuality, and enhances the
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:36.640]   desire to procreate. We conclude that HLAA, which is also MHC, mediates mate behavior in humans.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:42.240]   So there we go, we got four different studies that all confirm that a human beings and all life
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:51.120]   on the planet are genetically wired to seek out dissimilar genetics in mates in order to then go
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:56.240]   and produce stronger genetic offspring. So now, and then, and then the other thing that they all
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:02.880]   confirmed was that oral contraceptives, the unintended consequence of oral contraceptives,
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:09.360]   turned that ability off. So then, what would happen is that all the women taking oral
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:15.120]   contraceptives had a high chance of choosing the wrong mate from a genetic standpoint.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.840]   So, now, you know, so what do you do with this information? Well, I took a look at,
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.400]   okay, is that true? I mean, you know, they've got these studies, they looked at all of this stuff
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.520]   genetically. And then so what would be the other unintended consequences, right? So the very first
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:35.360]   thing that I wanted to do was I asked questions within my own research. I posed some questions and
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:40.640]   then went and found what the potential answers for those questions were. The first one was, okay,
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:46.800]   well, when did oral contraceptives get introduced into the human population? So according to the
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:52.800]   AMA Journal of Ethics, an article in Viewpoint published in June of 2020, the history was called
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.280]   the history of oral contraceptives. The Food and Drug Administration approved the first oral
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:06.800]   contraceptive in 1960. So 64 years ago, this is when they started, you know, basically making the
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:14.000]   birth control pill available to women. And as of 2020, more than 300 million women worldwide
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.720]   have used the pill. So that's our starting point. So to go down this rabbit hole, and you're saying,
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.200]   well, if all of this is true based on the science studies, then what has been the unintended
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:31.120]   consequences, sorry, consequences of affecting women's ability to do natural natural mate selection
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.360]   from a genetic standpoint. So what would be the first thing that would possibly happen?
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.520]   Well, the way I was looking at it, one of the first things that would happen is that if you,
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:45.840]   if you're a woman and you're on oral contraceptives, and you're basically your ability to choose the
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.280]   correct mate for you, genetically, you know, naturally, then you might, and you might end up,
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:57.200]   you know, basically attracted being attractive to a different person that you're supposed to
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:03.360]   genetically. And then how would that affect you? And how would that affect these relationships
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.080]   when, you know, people basically hook up, they get married, they have some kids, and when they have
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:14.320]   the kids, what happens? The women stop taking their oral contraceptives, right? So now they usually
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:19.360]   have one or two, three kids in a row. So when people get married, start having kids,
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.880]   the woman goes off the oral contraceptive, right? This is all I'm just just generalizing.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:31.520]   And when three, within three to five years, she's been off of it long enough. And then she's
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:40.080]   with a partner who if she selected someone who was similar, MHC profile genetics, her body,
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:46.640]   her genetics, her subconscious would be telling her this is not the right mate. I chose because she
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:52.240]   would then not be it, you know, in other words, you turn that thing back on, you're going to realize
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.520]   from a genetics standpoint, through your sense of smell that all of a sudden this is not the right
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.680]   mate, and you're going to go want to look for the right one. That's just what we're programmed to do.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:07.600]   Okay, so now would that be so if that's the an assumption, and that's a theory of mine,
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.320]   then let's take a look at the divorce rates. Is it true that since oral contraceptives have
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:17.040]   been introduced in the humans, human, you know, to human beings, you know, has there been, you
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:22.160]   know, has there been an effect on relationships? So taking a look at a study called divorce more
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:28.480]   than a century of change from 1900 to 2018, done by Bowling State or Bowling Green State University,
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:35.200]   the study was published in 2020. They indeed have been measuring divorce rates since 1900.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.880]   They determined that there's been almost a four times as many women experience a divorce in 2018
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:47.520]   compared to 1900. Okay, and that the peak divorce rate occurred in 1980, but it's starting to come
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:53.920]   down. So the interesting part about this is when you draw this graph out and you take a look at 1960,
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:59.120]   the introduction of oral contraceptive, look at the spike. And I'll just let you conclude what
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:04.480]   you want to conclude. But if we see this slow, steady rise because of whatever, you know, modernism
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:09.360]   and feminism and all that stuff, you know, and you look at, you know, like, you know, divorce rates.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.960]   But what's interesting was that this is, if you were to look at this line, it should, it should,
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:20.000]   if it's just increasing, it would go this direction. But instead, the moment that oral, you know,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.320]   oral contraceptives were introduced into the, into the, you know, population, there's this huge spike
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:32.560]   of divorces following in the 20 years following. And then it's slowly starting to come back down.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:38.080]   So there's one indication and, you know, I'm just saying this is a data point. It's not conclusive,
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:44.560]   but it certainly is very suspect that this might be yet another unintended consequences
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:50.160]   of oral contraceptives forcing or causing women to, you know, choose the wrong genetic mate for
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.320]   themselves. So then when you take a look at, well, you know, who's driving these divorces,
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:59.600]   is it the men or the women? Well, you know, that's a very good question because in an article called
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.840]   Who Wants Are Not Article, but a chapter in a book called Social Networks and the Life Course
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.600]   published in March of 2018, there's a chapter called Who Wants The Breakup. And it basically
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:16.160]   discusses gender and breakup and heterosexual couples. It's on pages 221 through 223. Now,
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:24.080]   in this study that was done by a gentleman called Michael Rosenfeld, he looked at 2,262 adults,
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:30.240]   ages 19 to 94 opposite sex partners, you know, and they started studying it in 2009.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:37.840]   By 2015, six years later, 371 of these people had broken up or gotten divorced.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.840]   Okay, so then when he studied who initiated those divorces, this is where his study concluded
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:52.720]   that Rosenfeld found that women initiated 69% of all divorces compared to 31% for men.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:58.480]   So what's the difference? Women are more likely to be on oral contraceptives than men. And this
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.560]   is where if you look at any of the research, you'll always hear this number that says, oh,
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.840]   women initiate, you know, 70% of the time women initiate divorce. Well, this is the study that
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:13.280]   everybody got that number phone. So then when you say, okay, well, you know, could this be a trend
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:20.480]   driven by women? And the answer is, yeah, the 69% of divorces are initiated by women,
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:26.080]   according to this study. And this is the trend line for divorces. So and all really kind of just
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.760]   kicks off right after oral contraceptives were introduced into the human population.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:37.440]   So it's quite interesting, another data point for consideration. So now what else could be possible
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:43.440]   that unintended consequence from oral contraceptives as it relates to genetic mate selection? Well,
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:49.360]   there's a study for that too. There in a study called HLA socialations and HLA sharing and
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:54.800]   reoccurring miscarriage published in 2015, done by Leiden University Medical Center in Leiden,
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:00.640]   the Netherlands. Now the aim of this study was a study of studies, right? So they studied 41,
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.640]   you know, different studies on this subject. Okay, on the on the factor, you know, miscarriages
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:13.440]   as specifically recurrent miscarriages. So now the aim of this meta analysis study was to evaluate
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:20.880]   whether specific maternal HLA LS and HLA sharing of couples, right? So are associated with the
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:26.720]   occurrence of recurrent miscarriages. Now what that means was they looked at similarities
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:33.120]   genetically, dissimilarities genetically, and what was the miscarriage rates between the two groups.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:39.760]   And they defined that recurrent miscarriages are RM was defined as three or more consecutive
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:45.920]   unexplained miscarriages. And a control group was included of women with at least one live birth
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:50.560]   and no miscarriages in their history. So that was the population of women that they looked at. So
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:57.760]   three or more on, you know, consecutive unexplained miscarriages. And was it the women who were dissimilar,
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:04.080]   which was normal, natural, or similar, which was the effect of the oral contraceptive.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:12.480]   And their results was that the meta analysis showed an increased risk of recurrent miscarriages
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:19.760]   in mothers carrying an HLA, you know, DRB one, which was dissimilar similarities. In other words,
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:28.960]   this study found that women who had mated with similar genetic partners had an increase in
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:35.840]   miscarriages over those who had chosen dissimilar mates. And I do want to point out too, this was
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:42.560]   very important in the study that they found in of the 41, they found a selection bias in 40 studies
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:48.400]   out of the 41. And they concluded that there was an information bias. But if you if you read
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.360]   as many studies as I do, you'll find that that's true of almost every study out there. The key
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.640]   point or the key takeaway, and you know, all of these are just studies. One study does not define
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.200]   the answer to any question, but it's just a data point. It's one more thing to go, hmm,
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:08.080]   maybe that's part of it, right? But they did find that there was an increase. So I went looking for
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:16.320]   historical. And the closest I could find was a study or a, you know, basically a study of
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:23.440]   miscarriages through the years, right? And so now this one started from this was a study on
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:30.720]   miscarriage rate estimates, vital statistics report for 1976 through 2004. So at least it covered,
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.680]   you know, a good, you know, 30 years, right? And so it started after oral contraceptives were
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.760]   introduced. So we don't know what was happening before that because there's just not enough data.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.400]   And then one of the parts of this research was a determination that not all and this was measured
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.360]   off of hospitalizations for miscarriages. So, you know, it doesn't include all the miscarriages
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:54.560]   that hospitals never find out. So they only looked at hospitalized miscarriages and the rates of those.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:00.880]   But if you take a look at the graph, you can see since 1976, all the way through 2004, you know,
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:08.640]   I just drew a linear algorithm, you know, lying here in the chart to show you that from a growth
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:15.520]   standpoint, even though there's fluctuations in miscarriage rates, you know, in the population,
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:21.040]   there's fluctuations, they go up and down. But the overall trend is up, specifically up for
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:27.680]   pregnancies that are under seven weeks, not as pronounced in pregnancies that are, you know,
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:34.960]   eight to 12 weeks and or 13 to 22 weeks. But the idea here in the evidence quite shows clearly
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:40.240]   that there is an increase in miscarriage rates over the time period that we're looking at from
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:48.240]   1960 till now, 64 years, and that it does coincide and collaborate with study done by
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:54.400]   the Leaden University in terms of the increase in miscarriages, specifically to women,
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:01.600]   four women who have chosen similar MHC partners, you know, the wrong genetics.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.320]   So that was, you know, an amazing aspect. So another question I ask is, well, what about
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.600]   the children? What about the children that are, you know, birth? Is there is there any evidence
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:19.600]   that shows that by choosing similar genetics, i.e., not producing stronger genetic offspring,
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:24.560]   you know, does that affect the children themselves, the one that actually get, you know, birth?
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:33.120]   And so now the Reichmann University in Herzle, Israel published a study in 2016 called
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:39.360]   Can Contraceptive Pill, you know, Can Contraceptive Pill affect future offspring's health
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.640]   and the implications of using hormonal birth control for human evolution. Now, this was a
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:50.480]   journal article published in SpringerLink 2016. They concluded in their study at the Reichmann
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:56.160]   University and they stated, "We compared the health of children born to parents who met while
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:01.200]   the mother was on the pill with that of children whose parents met when the mother was not on the
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:08.400]   pill. Results confirmed our predictions indicating that children to mothers who are on the pill
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:14.800]   are more infection-prone, require more medical care, suffer from a higher frequency of common
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:20.960]   sicknesses, and are perceived as generally less healthy than children whose parents met
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:28.800]   on non-pill circumstances." So this was very controversial. It's flat-out, anti-big pharma,
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:33.600]   which is rare. You know, it's hard to find studies that are so blatantly out there saying,
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:40.080]   "Hey, this is not a good thing, guys." And so it does actually confirm that there is some issue,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:46.000]   another data point. This is all about connecting the dots, but here is yet another data point
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.640]   that says, "When you go against the natural order of things and you introduce something into
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:56.560]   that, that blocks our normal, natural way of doing things, living our lives, specifically,
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.760]   mate selection. The most important decision you can make in your entire life is choosing the right
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:08.640]   mate and you all know what that means." Okay, not only could you have an increase in divorce rates,
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:13.280]   relationships don't work out when, you know, when the women finally come off the oral contraceptive,
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:19.680]   you also have the issue of miscarriage rates are increased, and then now the children that are
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:28.240]   the offspring have a distinct issue that kids that, you know, genetically stronger children don't.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:35.680]   So again, taking a look at the historical aspect of this, I was able to find a graph that measured
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:41.760]   the, this graph from the annals of asthma allergies and immunology published in 2022,
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:48.160]   and the study was Risk of Allergic Diseases from 1870 to 2020. So this one goes way back, okay?
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:52.880]   And the interesting thing about this study was that they denote that there's a very specific,
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:32:01.200]   you know, aspect to the study was when a particular allergy is, you know, basically discovered and
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.920]   they start studying it when it's been discovered. So that's kind of where the everything kind of
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:10.960]   baselines it at zero, because that's when it's been discovered, and then they track it from there.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:17.920]   So the earliest one was, you know, pre hygiene in 1860. So starting about 1873 was the very first
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:23.200]   allergy that was discovered, and they started tracking the, you know, the occurrences of that
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:31.360]   in the human population. And so from 1873, you can see this steady rise in the number of people that,
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:36.320]   you know, have hay fever, then you look at ragweed, you look at, and then they started getting into
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:44.800]   pediatric asthma, and so in sonophilic, I don't even know what that is, alpha,
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:50.640]   gal, first reported and peanut allergies. All right, so here we go. I drew a dot. This is 1960,
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:55.200]   the introduction of oral contraceptives. And let's take a look at the graph. What is the graph show?
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:02.240]   Has there been an increase in allergies in children in the human population since the introduction
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.200]   of oral contraceptives, and all the data you're looking at is says yes. And you know, and just
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:12.000]   you know, anecdotally, right? I mean, when you were a kid, and all of you out there, you know,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:19.040]   you're anywhere from 20 to 60, 70, 80 years old, I mean, you, I mean, honestly, when I was a child,
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:24.240]   there was no such thing as getting flyers, you have to take home to your parents that says,
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.080]   we have somebody in the school that's allergic to peanuts, don't bring peanuts to school.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.160]   When I was a parent and my daughter, I would get flyers that says everything from,
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.840]   please refrain from bringing chocolates because of this kid, please refrain, you know, and he kept
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.760]   getting in, and then over and over time, as time goes by, you know, all of a sudden,
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.760]   every menu and every restaurant, you know, you know, I'm saying, right? Has we, you know, we have,
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:49.200]   you know, allergy warnings and gluten free. And I mean, all of a sudden, it's like, it's this
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:56.000]   explosion of the number of people who have all these different allergies that I never, ever even
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.440]   heard about 40, 50 years ago. And then so, you know, you look, and here's the science behind that.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:07.680]   And the answer is, is there an increase in the number of people who are having all sorts of
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:13.200]   problems, health problems, since the introduction of oral contraceptives and the answer is, yeah,
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:18.080]   it really is. There's a lot of people out there with a lot more immunology problems
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:22.320]   than there ever were before in the history of humans, in terms of just all these problems,
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.800]   everywhere you go, someone's allergic to something where that just wasn't the case 50 years ago.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:33.200]   So one other thing I want to share with you is, you know, is there yet another unintended
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:37.760]   consequence? Have I made my point? Well, yeah, there's actually one more I wanted to share with
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:42.480]   you that popped out in the research. And this is an unintended consequence for the women who are
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:50.240]   taking oral contraceptives. And this itself is by the National Cancer Institute in a article written
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:56.080]   in 2018 called oral contraceptives and cancer risk. Now these, this, this is the government itself,
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:02.240]   right, or the government body itself, where they basically took a look at all of the studies on,
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:07.200]   on oral, you know, on oral contraceptives and cancer. And they did a study based on,
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:12.800]   it was a population based case control study, where they did observational studies. But they
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:17.760]   said they cannot definitively be established at an exposure. In this case, oral contraceptives,
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:25.440]   causes or prevents cancer, that's their disclaimer. But then they go, overall, however, these studies,
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:33.680]   this is another study of studies from the National Cancer Institute to 2000 2018.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.600]   They publish and it's still out there on their website. These studies have provided consistent
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:46.960]   evidence that the risks of breast and cervical cancers are increased in women who use oral
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:53.200]   contraceptives, whereas the risk of endometrial ovarian and collectoral cancers are reduced.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:59.840]   So good and bad, but just the fact that they're increased. So there's, and, and okay, everybody,
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:04.880]   how many people did you know had breast cancer when you were a teenager, as opposed to now?
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:09.600]   Is that been going up as well? I didn't go looking for a graph on that one. That's just sort of an
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:17.120]   adult. I think it is yet another data point in this theory and, and in this debate, that is it
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:22.640]   possible that oral contraceptives is a really, really bad idea for us as a species. So, you know,
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:27.520]   one other thing, let's talk about it before I wrap this up for you, is that in the discussion
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:33.440]   section of this, this theorem that I'm putting out on the internet here is, you know, one of the
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:38.160]   things that I did check, which was I check with my favorite AI, which is the best one out there
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.560]   right now. It's rated the highest, best one called the quad AI. And I just basically asked,
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.760]   hey, go look at a bunch of studies about oral contraceptives, altering female mate selection.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.760]   And, and what do you find? You know, summarize it for me. And so the interesting thing was,
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:58.480]   was my question was, do oral contraceptives alter, you know, may alter female mate selection? And so,
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.120]   now the AI did all this work for me, and I just wanted to share it with you. And it said, yeah,
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.520]   based on all these different studies that it has access to, which is pretty much all the studies,
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:13.760]   right? That, you know, that mentors menstrual cycle variation, that the pill may disrupt the
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:18.960]   variation and make preferences that occurs throughout a woman's menstrual cycle, that
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:24.560]   attractiveness to men, that the pill may impact a woman's attractiveness to men, competition with
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:30.720]   other women, the pill may impact a woman's ability to compete with other women for mates,
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:39.840]   preferences for less masculine male, women who take the pill may prefer less masculine men,
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:46.800]   and may be more likely to choose men with less masculine faces as partners. And then lastly,
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:52.720]   older preferences popped out, which is the entire videos about, where women who take the pill may
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.600]   shift their preference towards men with similar MHC odors, which that's I've been talking about
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:06.000]   for an hour now. So I have only touched on one attribute of oral contraceptives impact of female
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.720]   mate selection, but I wanted to point out, and the point of this slide is that there are others
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:16.400]   as well, and that odor, the ability for us to detect through smell, the correct mate for us
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.840]   genetically, is one of many different things that are happening because women are taking oral
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:28.320]   contraceptives. So the last, the last thing I want to do to wrap this up is, hey, you know what,
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:34.320]   are oral contraceptives impacting the natural selection process? And the answer is absolutely
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.760]   yes. I mean, I'm, I'm stating that. That's my theorem. You know, for everything I've read,
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:45.920]   through all of the science studies, I've seen, yes, it absolutely is affecting it undoubtedly.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:52.000]   And then, but what are the unintended consequences to summarize one, one more time? Well, the unintended
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   consequences are, you know, that, hey, oral contraceptives increased cancer risk clearly.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:04.400]   Oral contraceptives will block your, you women, your ability to select the correct genetic mate
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:11.920]   for yourself and produce weaker genetic offspring. Okay, the consequences of that are increases in
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:18.320]   miscarriage rates, right? And in care, and also increase, obviously, the offspring are,
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.760]   are a key aspect of that. So miscarriages and, and birth, you know, health problems,
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:28.720]   divorce rates, cancer, it's, it doesn't look good. And then the other thing I do want to,
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:33.120]   you know, put out there, and again, this is, you know, this type of rabbit hole research is all
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.600]   about connecting the dots. So I really want to stipulate here to, you know, my opinion that,
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:41.600]   you know, are there other factors at play, you know, like what else happened, you know,
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:46.400]   in the 1960s and 50s that could be affecting, you know, since then it's been 60 years, right?
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:52.720]   So what other factors are at play here? Well, clearly, the planet Earth has been extremely
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:58.240]   radiated from all of the nuclear testing that occurred in the 50s and 60s, because of Chernobyl,
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:04.240]   because of Fukushima, the, the, in the level of radiation on the planet is at all time high,
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:08.480]   since we even started measuring it. And that's not even including, and if you
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:15.280]   include it, non-native EMF, okay? So now you've got all this, you know, ambient rate, you know,
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:20.240]   radiation, the actual gamma rates, and alpha and beta, you know, radiation on the planet,
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:26.000]   but you've also got EMF radiation as well, from all the satellites, the Wi-Fi, the cell phones,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.160]   all that stuff. So there's this huge level of increase in radiation.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:36.560]   And could that have a, you know, play a role in what we're seeing in terms of genetic offspring,
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:41.040]   you know, having issues in health and miscarriage and all of that? Yeah, absolutely. I think it's
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:46.960]   absolutely true. I think that oral contraceptives, when you plug that into the, into the, you know,
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:54.160]   into the, you know, the equation, I think it definitely plays a role, and it is definitely not the only
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:59.200]   cause of all of these problems that we're seeing, you know, down the line since the 1960s.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:04.720]   And secondly, too, you know, when you look at the other factors that play, you've got the
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:11.440]   introduction of just a ton of horribly toxic chemicals into the food supply. You look at
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:16.480]   there's a ton of pharmaceuticals that are now in the water supply. There's the introduction of
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:22.400]   microplastics, and all of these, and all these endocrine blockers that are in the food and water
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:28.480]   supply that are causing sperm, you know, that sperm counts on men is down 50% over the last
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:34.400]   20 years. So is there, you know, is there more factors that play in the answers? An absolute yes.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:43.200]   However, my theorem is that oral contraceptives has a significant role in that unfolding nightmare
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:49.040]   that our species is facing. And that, and the, and the great news about that is that you can,
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.040]   you can do something about that. Okay, you can definitely do something about that, not medical
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:58.400]   advice, just telling you, based on the science, based on the research, based on the trends. Okay,
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.400]   make a decision here. So my last question that I want to share with you, and I, by the way,
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.240]   if you guys want to comment, I would love to hear what you think or what your thoughts are on this,
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:14.800]   but also that my last question is, does this affect the evolution of our species as human beings?
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.640]   And when I thought about this, I think that we're going to go in three different directions.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:25.280]   And I think that when you look at the three directions we're going is that as natural selection
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:30.400]   continues, they'll always be people. And when you look at 300 million women, there's nine billion
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:35.360]   humans on the planet, half of them are women. So there's four and a half billion, I'm generalizing,
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:42.560]   four and a half billion women, and only 300 million of them are on contraceptives. That's a pretty
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:48.800]   small number of total women. But what concerns me, you know, that are on oral contraceptives and
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:53.840]   and are affected by this. But what concerns me about that, though, even though it's a small number,
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:43:00.720]   300 million of four and a half billion, the issue to me is that, you know, ask access to health care.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:08.800]   What group of women on the planet have the access to health care and the money to pay for it? And
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:15.760]   that's going to be your predominantly resource rich cultures and societies on the planet. So we're
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:26.000]   basically taking the, I would say the more advantageous group of the population of humans on the planet,
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   and we're genetically screwing with them, right, which I think is going to be more detrimental
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:39.200]   to the species than if we were to screw with a impoverished group of individuals in some country
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.440]   that no one even knows where it is. And you know, what's the effect of that? And I'm not trying to
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:49.040]   be disparaging here, but you get where I'm going, right? So I think that there's a huge, huge impact
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.680]   to the evolution of our species, not just, you know, even though 300 million is a low number
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:58.800]   compared to the total, but it's which 300 million. And it's the ones that are the resource rich
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:04.720]   individuals that are driving the planet from a technology standpoint and everything else from
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:10.880]   what resource rich people do. And so that's, that's concerning. So you've got a group of people
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:16.160]   out there that are basically going to keep, you know, selecting the correct genetic mate for
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:21.680]   themselves and producing genetic offspring, the natural way survival of the species. And so they're
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.920]   constantly going to be doing genetic strengthening, right? So their offspring are going to be strong,
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.600]   then their offspring will pick the right mate and have stronger and stronger and stronger,
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.080]   just as nature had designed us to do. And then there's going to be a group of people that produce,
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.480]   you know, let's say they they're on oral contraceptives and they produce, then they find someone who's
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:44.240]   genetically similar to them. And they produce a set of offspring that are no better off than
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:49.680]   their prior generation of genetic. And so their gene pool doesn't get stronger. And so there's a
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:55.200]   stagnation. And no one knows yet, it's not long enough. It's only 60 years. But what happens when
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.000]   there's this group of humans on the planet that are genetically stagnated, that don't get stronger,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.120]   that it goes against the natural order of the survival of the species, what happens from those
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:09.680]   guys, nobody would know. But the one that's most concerning that we have the most amount of
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:15.040]   concern about, and we have the data for that's been shared with you just now, are the ones that
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:19.840]   are producing genetic weaknesses. When you mate with the wrong person genetically, you produce a
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:25.360]   genetically weaker offspring, what happens if those genetically weaker offspring go on to
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:30.640]   themselves like mothers encouraging daughters to use oral contraceptives and so on and so on.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:34.160]   And by the time you get to the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth generation
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:38.480]   of these genetically weaker and weaker and weaker, weaker offspring, what's going to be
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.480]   happening? And I think we're seeing some of that now. In 60 years, you know, many generations
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:48.240]   that's happened since then, I'm a product of the 60s, I was born in the 60s. So there's been three,
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:53.600]   literally three generations since then, my generation grew up, had kids, my kids have had
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:58.880]   kids. So there's three generations now. And what happens as each generation goes,
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:04.080]   and by the way, I have completely been against oral contraceptives for my daughter, told her not
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.720]   to take it. She 100% agree with me. This is way before I ever did the research. I just don't trust
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:14.080]   big pharma. So she doesn't ever has never taken it, never takes vaccines as I do. We just avoid
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:18.960]   that crap because we just, I just think big pharma is just there. They haven't been around long enough
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:23.680]   to know what the unintended consequences of the stuff that they do. And that's why I call it an
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:27.600]   unintended consequence. Did they know that this was going to happen when they came up with this
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:35.200]   great idea to give women the freedom to be able to just have intercourse and without the worry of
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:40.480]   birth or being pregnant? I mean, that was actually a great thing when it launched. And it's still a
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:45.120]   great thing, right? I mean, there's a lot of births that don't need to happen. So nothing
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:49.760]   wrong with that. And that's fine. But if you do that, look at what happens. What are the unintended
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:55.520]   consequences? So to answer my question for all of you guys for discussion, is that how does this
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:00.720]   affect the evolution of our species? You know, we're producing genetically weaker offspring
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:05.440]   who then go on to produce genetic. And then what happens down the row? What happens to genetic
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:10.080]   stagnation? Because we know what happens with genetic strengthening. The species gets stronger,
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.000]   right? Well, what about those other two groups of people? These other two groups
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:22.880]   are the future. And hopefully, I'm just hopefully it all works out. You know, nature has a way,
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:28.640]   right? So anyway, so that's my research. That's my theory. I think it does affect it. I think it's
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:33.760]   very bad. Not medical advice, but I think that it's something you should consider. These are all
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:38.560]   of the data points. These are all the dots for you to connect in your own opinion, your own mind.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:43.040]   I welcome all your comments. That's what this is all about. I just like to do research and I
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:48.560]   like to share. So thank you for watching this video. Now every study, all the art, all my research for
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:53.360]   this video, I'm going to just throw it into a folder on OneDrive and put the link below in the video
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:56.880]   description. So that if you want to read the studies yourself or you want to continue this
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.400]   research, you don't have to go hunting around for this stuff. It's right there. So just there'll
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:04.400]   be a link in there for all that research. Because you know, DIY research, full transparency, all
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:08.720]   that stuff. Anyway, so thank you for watching the video. If you find this content interesting,
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:13.200]   this is kind of what I do. You can always just, I appreciate it. If you'd like and subscribe,
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.960]   it helps support the channel. Also, you want to find out more about me. You can come to the
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:22.240]   Tinkers Academy, where I've got all my other research projects posted on my blog. And you can
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:27.920]   just type in Tinkers.academy in your URL window. I'll put a link below. Also too, you know, if you're
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:32.640]   interested in health and healing, I have a health and healing telegram chat group that we discuss
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:38.320]   everything related to health and healing. And this is going to be one of the discussions coming
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:42.800]   up once I post this video. So again, thank you for your time, everyone. I appreciate it.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:46.880]   I know time is precious to you. I hope this was interesting. I hope this was educational.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.880]   I hope it was informative. And I would love, I would absolutely love to hear what your
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.600]   theories are after I have just shared all this research with you. So again, thank you very much.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:58.240]   Aloha and have a great day.
