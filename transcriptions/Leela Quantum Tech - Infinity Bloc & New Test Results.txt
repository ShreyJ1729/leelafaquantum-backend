[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and in this video, very special. I've got Philip von Holzendorf with Leila Quantum Tech with me. And he and I are both excited to introduce the new product that they've got there at Leila Quantum Tech called the Infinity Block, but even more so and even more amazing.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   The sharing of the new test results by the base institute and a dark field microscopy study that was done on the Infinity Block and some of the Leila products.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   For those of you who are interested in the actual like, what is the evidence of this energy and of these products and what do they really do at a bio energetic and physical level, then please stick around and let's go through those test results and share that with you.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Thank you. But Philip, good morning. How are you doing today?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Hi K, yeah, sounds great. I'm looking forward to this year really and I'm doing fine.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Awesome, you know, so excited about the Infinity Block. I've been playing around with my Q Block for a few weeks. And oh, for those of you who are new to Leila Quantum Tech, this is I think number four or five in a series of videos that I've been doing to kind of introduce Leila Quantum Tech
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   and Philip to the world and basically talking about this incredible energy that has encompassed in the products and then also these products that actually you can create other things with it.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   So this is number four. I'll have all the links to the other interviews earlier where you can learn more about the other products and about Leila specifically.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   But I do want to point out something before we start though is, and this is something really cool. Maybe you can touch on this, but you know, I just want to say that, you know, I've kind of looked at this, you know, this kind of space, you know, this quantum energy
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   and energy products and everything from, you know, crystals to, you know, you know, chakras and singing bowls and I mean, I've been doing this stuff for so long.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And I've always found it so fascinating, but I think what's really, really, really cool about Leila Quantum Tech is that it's supported and developed by a healer network.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   So Philip is your spokesman and you're the owner operator, right? Of the like the store, right? Of the actual physical, you know, merchandising and all that, but the actual development is a product of a team of healers.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   So Philip, can you like maybe kind of talk a little bit about the team? It's a team approach to developing these frequencies and developing these products that are part of Leila.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Yes, thank you for bringing that up actually. So it's something that we've thought of because, you know, we set this all up to actually bring something to the world that can truly help people, but not only people, but also animals, certainly
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   plants and so on. And, you know, through my wife and, you know, also my activities in my parallel life, you know, I'm a sham and myself actually have gone through a lot of shamanic workshops and stuff like that.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   We've gotten to know a lot of, yeah, very interesting healers that are not only interesting, but they are, they know exactly what they do and they've done this for decades and they've, they've also trained lots of other healers
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   in some cases, thousands of other healers across the globe. So they're well respected. They don't have a lot of time typically because they're just, you know, people just run to them and constantly want their advice and their help and want to be trained and all that.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And we introduced this to them because we had, we had seen that it would be fantastic if, if we release frequencies, then we want to release the purest and best and most helpful frequencies that are possible for the various causes or instances.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   And we also wanted to certainly double and triple check, you know, how, how they work. And the idea behind those frequency cards is really something that one needs to explain and we haven't really done this on the website.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I'm realizing that, yes, in those cards, there are frequencies for specific topics, you know, take the inner piece card as an example.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   But it's not just that. So if you have a problem and with your life. And as an example, now it's around this inner piece topic, right? You feel a lot of anger or you feel constantly this anxiety and burned out.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   As an example, you can go to an experienced healer and book sessions and then they will help you through that through talking through energy work through providing certain frequencies and stuff like that.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And what we've done here is basically to create a solution. That is, well, it's not as powerful as a one on one session with one of those healers.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It's something that you can constantly leverage without having to set up and book and pay for appointments to work through certain topics.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And that is basically what we try to create and also in a way where people don't become dependent on a certain frequency, like, you know, you get a headache and you take an ad bill, you know, and then you continue to do that all your life.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   You get a headache and you take an ad bill. That's exactly not the concept that we wanted to follow. We wanted the people to have the opportunity to learn with this frequency, adapt to it.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And then really develop that ultimately, ideally, they don't need these frequencies anymore, or they needed from a different viewpoint or a different level because they've already took a quantum leap to the next level and, you know, getting more into the inner piece to stay with this one example.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Yeah, and then we're very blessed with these amazing healers and we were also planning on coming out with a few interviews to introduce them a little bit more.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So it's just always a matter of time. And yeah, but I promise we will get this started very soon.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   That's awesome. I never thought about it that way that, yeah, because I know all of these individuals have, you know, they do webinars and workshops and things like that.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And the results are quite amazing from a testimonial standpoint. But you know, I never thought about that that way. You're right. I guess that it's kind of like your take home kit, your homework, when you go to a webinar, or you go to a session, I guess the frequencies themselves, they work, you know, they work independently.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Yes. And it actually, and it can spark ideas for other healers out there, right? Because if you're a really good healer and you have your clients and you help them.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   But then you you typically know, you know, if I just see this client once a month as an example, they may have some times in between where they still need this energy.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   They provide that, but a great way to do that is maybe there's a specific frequency that, you know, that healer would like to charge on some of one of those cars and then give that to to their client.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   So that's just an idea of what can be done with this technology.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   That's great. Awesome. Okay, so pretty cool. Okay, so now let's talk about the new product.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Now the our last chat was we talked about the cue block. And now you've got an infinity block. So I guess the very first question is, you know, it's like, you know, like, what's the difference between the two are actually, I'm sorry.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   First question is, what is this? And then what's between the two? Like, how would you, how would you explain that?
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Yes, so the quantum block to reiterate that is a quantum energy space generator. That's how you could call it within the plate in this space in between the plates.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   There's a very concentrated and pure quantum energy space that can do multiple things. If you put your hand in it, we'll talk about that later, then it improves your blood per the all of the tests that were done.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   It improves your well being. You can, if you put something in, you can copy a frequency of something into another object, and you can charge objects with quantum energy.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And then you just by not doing anything with it, just having it sit at home. It provides a very nice energetic field for the whole home, basically. So the, the left one, which is the quantum block has the range of about 130 to 145 feet.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It's like 30, 40, 40 meters, something like that, a radius. And now we come to the difference. The infinity block is just the very powerful version of that.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   So to put it in perspective, the quantum block has 90 so-called quantum consciousness levels, 90, 90. And this first basic infinity block contains already 600 of those.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   So that is quite a difference. And, you know, people that can see energy, they immediately see that. And even most people that can't see energy, they feel it. They feel it in both ways, but they really also feel the difference of it.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And so what does that mean? So if you want to charge things in the infinity block, it goes way, way quicker.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   If you want to just copy a frequency, it only takes in this basic version, only 10 seconds and up to 10 seconds, actually. And then the frequency is already transferred. It would take longer in the quantum block.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   And then the energy field that it provides around a home, for example, is way larger. So we talked about the 130, 145 feet for the quantum block. Now we're talking one kilometer for the basic infinity block, which is a huge range.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   One must say, though, that the field outside of this core isn't nearly as strong as inside the core. It's different.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And so if you put your hand in it, that's a completely different result that you get from just being outside. But if just on the outside, it harmonizes EMF and all of that.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   I hope this explanation helps a little bit. And by the way, go ahead.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Well, I was just thinking, there's a lot of folks that understand this because they've been tinkering around with these types of devices for a little while now, but for someone who's completely new to it, I'm just trying to think in my mind how to explain it.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I guess the idea, though, is if you're completely new to it, and Philip, correct me if I'm wrong, then you might be familiar with the idea that for decades and decades, right, even going back to our First Nations people, they've always had a reverence for special stones, special places on Earth, crystals and things like that that held an energy or what we translate
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   as frequency, that it held a special like mana and that sort of thing.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   And so the concept of that is what this represents.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   It's Philip and his team's ability to take very talented and gifted people to put together and concentrate that type of energy, that life force source energy.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   There's multiple different names for it, quantum energy, into a device.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   And so the products that are being sold, they resonate with all these different frequencies, whether you saw it on the list right here.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   So I just wanted to point this out that these are the different types of frequencies, things that can help people with sleep and rest, inner peace, you know, some heels for dogs and cats and we heal literally primal healing frequencies that help.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   That's the idea is that you can embed that type of energy, that spiritual source, life force, chi, prana, organ, energy into a device.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Now what makes these things special, these blocks, is that they not only are an energy object, so you can just take it, put it on a shelf and your house resonates with this very powerful positive energy.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   But they also inside of this, it looks so simple, but there's a lot more going on, is that concentrated space.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   And so my question, Philip, is when you put something in there, then whatever's in there gets charged up with that energy and it becomes an energy object, right, if not already.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   And that's the concept, right? Yes. Exactly. And you can say that it actually energetically optimizes the structure of everything you put in there.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Yeah. And we've got some real interesting dark field microscopy photos to show you what happens to the physical body, the blood, when you actually encounter one of these devices that's coming up next.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   But so the thing that I want to point out, though, is that this thing basically has an energy field, just like the human bio field, right?
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   So I'm wondering, is this kind of like a toroid, because I've read so many different individuals like yourself or very energy workers and things like that.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   And they kind of describe the bio field as like an egg shape. If you ever look at a diagram of chakras, it's sort of the energy bio fields like an egg shape.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   And then other objects have a toroidal shape. So when your healers look at this object, what's the shape of the field that this thing is in the middle of?
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   It's a quantum sun. That's exactly what it is. And that also shows that it is in no way earthbound. It doesn't have a toroidal field. It actually really is a true quantum sun.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   So that means that from the core in each direction, it transmits that energy in equal strength into all directions.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   So it's not? Oh, okay. Is your, is that, is it pronounced mandala? Yes. So is this representative of the field that you, that the energies, you know, folks that can see auras in energy?
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Is that what they see? Is that how that your own mandala was created? Was it was like a visual representation of the field?
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   That wasn't the intention. But it, yeah, you could interpret it into it. Let's say it that way. But no, the mandala started to exist out of a difference.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   There wasn't any connection in regards to the field itself.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Yeah, I'm just asking, because I posted on our telegram chat that really interesting lecture by a person who had done those experiments with mandalas and energy objects.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   And that the mandala ended up being like a, like a quantum receiver. It was really weird. But anyway, we won't go into that.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   But you know, you could use sacred geometry and bio geometry objects, by the way, and use that in combination with these energy fields to then transmit across the source.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Or, you know, quantum space. Okay, I don't want to go there too far, but, but I'm just really interested in this stuff.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Okay, so that basically explains what the object is. So there's a difference between what's inside and then what's around it, right?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   And if you put something inside, then it gets charged up. So, and so the difference between the two, I guess, that's the main question.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   You've got, you know, you came out with the cube block. We talked about that in the last interview.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   And then this one now is the infinity block and it's much stronger. So, so you're saying it takes like you could put something in here for 10 seconds.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   That would only that would take over here like three minutes. Is that correct?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Yes, that is absolutely correct. It's it works almost instantly, actually.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   And it's hard to understand with the mind, but that's really how concentrated quantum energy works and can work.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   And another difference also is that, you know, this infinity block, while you can, you know, get one of those just as one, which may be enough for a lot of people, you can also get it as a package of two.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   And then what what that enables you to do is to upgrade it along your lifetime or, you know, your grand grandchildren's lifetime, they can still upgrade this.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   If it's in your possession because, yeah, you know, this doesn't stop working, right? It's not, you know, it's not connected to electricity or anything. So it will last little you forever.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   And, you know, you can you can upgrade it then. So, there, I want to bring in some caution, though, because it gets very, very strong.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   So, already the second version is, is seven times stronger than the first infinity blog version.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   And then each further upgrade would be again, seven times stronger. And what we suggest to people is to experience the first version.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   For really some time and then, you know, you feel called to go to the second version. That's great. The field will always be harmonious because there's no brute force leveraged or needed at all.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   And this is so that's fantastic. However, the pure quantum energy gets so concentrated that we don't advise anyone going over the second level, you know, within the first six to possibly even 12 months.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   So, so you're saying that you could get, well, that you, that this thing can, on other words, I could take, I could, if I got two of these, I could take one, put it in the other.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   And then the one that I put inside the other becomes seven times stronger than the first one.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Yes, that is correct. And then if you keep doing it, like back and forth, the thing grows exponentially until you could literally create a quantum sun energy portal, you know, source.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   That's in that to infinity.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   It's theoretically that is the case and it would also be practically the case and the case, but that's, that's, you know, one of those things.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   We tend to overdo it in, in our lives, right, that, you know, we, you know, if someone gets drunk, they want to get really drunk.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   If someone wants to do sport, they typically, then they, I mean, they need to do the triathlon and do it every day, you know, so we tend to overdo things and this is something we shouldn't overdo.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   It's something where we should check in with ourselves and feel, okay, what is the right level? Because I frankly don't think right now that anybody needs any level beyond the second at this point and then, you know, get used to that.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And then there may be the time where indeed, you know, frequent, your own frequency has raised and you've become more transparent in a way.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Also, the energies on earth certainly keep shifting and developing, then you'll be called to now upgraded again, right, but it's really something that it's very, very powerful.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   It's very, very powerful.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Okay, so in talking about, yeah, I could go, I mean, everybody knows I'm a tinker and, you know, I'm like in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and you know what I worry about all the time is what Fukushima's done to the ocean.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   And so I'm just right off the bat, I'm thinking, well, why don't I make one big enough that covers the ocean, you know, the field.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   So if you're saying, like, let's say the field, like how big is this field? I think you have it right here somewhere.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   The field, yeah, it's a kilometer, right. So this, right, so this energy field for the infinity block stretches out for a kilometer.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   So does that mean that if I charge another infinity block in the first infinity block that the second infinity block has a seven and a half kilometer field.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   That's actually a great question and that's what you would guess, indeed, but it's actually not the case.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   So, yeah, so at the matter of fact, though, the second one has also one kilometer off the field, but it's way denser.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   That's very interesting and we can't tell you at this point what happens with the third generation, I will be able to report on that probably over the next two weeks, because we still have to do that test and see actually how the radius develops.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   I guess is that the radius will increase from that point and stay as at least as dense as the second. However, really, with the second, it's still a kilometer. It's just a denser field.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Okay, all right, that makes sense. So what happens if I put the cue block inside the infinity block?
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   You would upgrade it and make it stronger and I would not advise to do that in general because the quantum block really has its purpose to have exactly the strengths level and the quantum consciousness levels that it has for specific use cases.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And especially if we're talking about copying frequencies, I, for example, and we, as a company, only use the quantum block for that. If you want to create frequency medicine as an example.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   If you want to use an ibuprofen and you really want to ingest it, you want to take an ibuprofen, but you want to neutralize the negative frequencies of it, you can put it in the quantum block and you can do that for like 30 seconds.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   And then you're done with that and that's also an application where I suggest you use the quantum block because the infinity block is, is so strong that it can increase the onlyopathic dose, basically, off such, you know, pharmaceuticals as an example that you can't estimate, you know, how strong this now is.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And yeah, that's really the main use case where I say, okay, just keep that for the quantum block and then where you want to add a much higher vibration than use the infinity block.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   And certainly for your home, that's always a consideration, right, you know, people that are new to this, I wouldn't, and that haven't really done energy work, I would always suggest to really get started also with the quantum block in general and not just go straight to the infinity block.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   And you could just get an infinity block and it comes charged right you don't have to buy a cube lock first.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Yes, I mean, we don't, we don't tell people how to do this, frankly, we give our advice and give our strong recommendation, but people are responsible for themselves also.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   And what's important to note is that these devices, they provide a harmonious field so there's no energetic pressure, there's no brute force, which if that was the case.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Probably we would have to put restrictions on this because, yeah, it can be damaging in a way, right, and in this case that's not the case, and we just recommend from an energetic standpoint to do this for the other way, but people can choose.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   And also with the infinity block people can choose to just get one or get two, it's their decision. Okay, yeah, and for those of you that missed the prior interview about the cube lock, I just wanted you to know what you can put in there is anything.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   And so like every morning I put my cup of coffee in there I charge it up it's kind of like, yeah, I just I juice up everything that I ingest through the cube lock.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   I put all, you know, I'd my keys in there my, I mean, you could put I put seeds in there, and you know, just to plant them in my garden and I mean just anything your food your water, especially my water.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   I love my lay the wall water ball by way. And so there's just every little thing and then it's so can you imagine if all the items around you are resonated with positive energy, or you could take any one of those frequencies I listed and try to imagine if you could just put in like, you know, like a sleep and rest frequency
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   and you could take like, you know, you're like pillows, you could stick them in in the cube lock and then you could put their frequency in your pillows and all that kind of stuff so the idea of what you could put inside this is unlimited.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   And you could not only just put it in there and charge it up with positive energy.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   You could also put a frequency into those items as well. And there's like, you know, I think we should really eventually do a whole discussion just on like how to use it.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   But this is what it does as opposed to how to use it. And yeah, it's just it's fascinating what you've come up with.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   So I'm just kind of wondering if there's any highlights here on this webpage. Now this is live on the website about this is the infinity block page.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   So you're talking about polarity range. Oh, then there's license. We'll get into that in a little while, how to transfer frequencies and so forth.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   So all the information's here about the infinity block. And I guess the main thing that is just really, I think, you know, one of the touch on is like, A, what's the difference?
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   But then you said something in telegram that I want to touch on about the infinity block and you said something about don't leave it in there.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Stuff, you know, like if I put like a cup of coffee in there or I put my keys in there and my glasses, anything like I have metal pens I carry around.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   I want those charges. But don't put it in there for more than a minute or it becomes part of the quantum like field.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   So, you know, so what does that mean exactly like what's the like the morning that you're giving about.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Because like, you know, I forget sometimes and I'll put stuff in my cube lock and I'll forget it for more than three minutes.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   I'm assuming that's a bad thing, but you're kind of like we're cautious. So could you go expand on that?
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Yes, so indeed that happens if you put we've encountered that with metals that if you put metals in there.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And it may happen with with other substances as well after a longer timeframe, but let's take a titanium sphere as an example if you put it in and you leave it in there for more than three minutes.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Then it indeed, if you take it out, it's still in the infinity block.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   So you take it, you walk with that sphere to the bathroom and or outside and you still have your infinity block sitting in your living room.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   What was it's not moving still that sphere that you have in your hands somewhere else it's still energetically in this quantum space of the infinity box it's it's still there energetically.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   And so there's a there's a connection and then what what that by itself is not necessarily a bad thing right I, you know, we haven't experimented too much with that in order to say okay, how long does it take to then reduce that effect.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   And at some point we know after a couple days or so at at latest after these four or five minute charging, then that connection is is gone.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   We don't know how that is if we do that for half an hour an hour, but what we do know is that if you took that sphere, then within those next several days and put it in.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   The quantum block, then it increases the quantum consciousness levels of the quantum blog, because of this whole interaction and you don't want that.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   So because you want to, you want that. So, so my main recommendation would be if you leave something in the infinity block, don't put it in any quantum block, nor in any lower charged infinity block.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   And at any time, for at least like a week or so. Okay, good, good to know. Yeah, because I wasn't thinking how would that be a bad thing to carry that much, you know, to carry with you kind of thing like, like take a take take your spheres, put them in the infinity block and then put
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   the capsule and walk around with it to be like having the infinity block around your neck, right, because if it becomes part of the space and then just do that once every seven days, she day on, I'm just tinkering.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Okay, so, but that makes sense. Don't don't mess. Don't don't blend the two together. Any, you know, but well, okay, so, but that brings up the subject of bleed over or the copy effect.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   You know, so, so let me explain. For those who don't know what that means is, there are the products on the market that if you charge, let's say you have a, you know, let's say you have a pendant.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   And it's, you know, and, and you put it in the stronger, you know, device, like, like this would be considered stronger, more powerful, I guess is a better word is powerful.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And you put it, let's say I have one object that I put it sleep and rest frequency in, and I put it in the infinity block, and I have another object, another pendant that I put just in the queue block, the regular one.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   And I charge that with, like, inner piece, but, and then these other products, though, if you bring those two together, the stronger one with the, with the weaker one, the stronger one bleeds over so then the weaker one now becomes inner piece and sleep and rest, right?
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   It just, it's just the frequencies get blended and they get all mixed up. Hawaii, we call that, you know, the word for that is kapakahi, you call them all over the place.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   You know, and you don't want that because I treat all my pendants like golf clubs. I have a row of pendants that are all in the same level of energy so they don't bleed over to each other, so that depending on how I feel every day, I can go, oh, I want to heal, or I want the men's booster.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   I'll, you know, I need, I need some inner piece today. You know, and so, but, because I, but I always worry about the, about the bleed over effect because, because, you know, then I've got other stronger ones that I keep, like, I keep in the little purple bag.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   So, when it comes to the infinity block, if I were to charge something in the infinity block, is there a, and would it, would it bleed over to something that was charged in the queue block?
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   If they were just, each other? It would not. So, unless, unless what could happen, theoretically, is if you leave these things in too long in the infinity block, and then, you know, put it next to something else.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   So, that's something I can't even speak to right now because we need to further test that, but that's, that's a possibility. I would not rule that out, at least, but with normal charging in the infinity block.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   There's not going to be any bleed over, and there's also not going to be any bleed over if you charge anything in the quantum block, versus something that wasn't charged in the quantum block. And we actually started off with assuming bleed over effects, and we also developed actually a system on how to prevent that with certain bags.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   And excuse the background noise, my dog wanted to come into the room and participate in interview.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   So, minor sleep behind me.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   And yeah, but then we were able to develop it all in a way where there is no bleed over effect so this is not an intrusive energy.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   So then the question is okay so different, the difference is certainly with water, for example, right so let's let's take a frequency card that is an inner piece.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   It radiates that frequency out, and you can leverage that energetically, and your physical body can leverage that because you have that frequency there and you can leverage it.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   So if you put it underneath the water glass, the water also picks up that energy.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   So, because water is very receptive, it's always a very easy transfer, everything that contains a lot of water, pretty much the same thing.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   If we're talking metals or very dense objects, then there is no bleed over, then so if I took a blank frequency card that is not charged with anything and put it on top or underneath the inner piece frequency card as an example,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   then that blank card would be surrounded by that energy of the charged card and its frequency, but it would not intrude, it would not make this other object take it on.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   And I think that's a very important point so you don't really have to worry about that.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Okay, so the key is if you basically charge it for the right amount of time.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   So you'd want to be careful not to put something in here for too long and get it near this, but if you put it in there for just the right time, then you should be alright, I guess is the way you're doing it.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   So what is the right time, so let's say I put a glass of water in the cube lock, and I know and more my cup of coffee and I time it three, I put a timer on my phone three minutes pull it back out.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   You know, because that's what you were kind of alluding to in the last interview was three minutes right, was max on a cube lock.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   So what's quote max in an infinity block.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   It depends on the object so everything that's food or water beverage etc we recommend for no more than 20 seconds, possibly 30 seconds.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   You know, there's a human and animal consumption, and you know not that stuff really goes bad but things things like a pineapple or other fruits they can be more ripe afterwards and also it could be too much energy in general so we just say you know that's 20 or 30 seconds at the most
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   literally 10 seconds is enough, right so you get a little bit higher vibration and possibly a better effect if it's 20 seconds, but 10 seconds is pretty much sufficient it really works almost instantly.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   And then for metal and then we're talking yeah exactly so I was going to just go there so in terms of metals, you know we, it's also just nearly 10 seconds to charge the sphere in this basic infinity block, and we suggest to leave it in there for no longer than a minute.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Okay so one is that one minute in the queue blocker or.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   And then infinity block one minute.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   Yes and if you have it in there for two minutes, you will probably still be fine.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   And then but then the time starts where you just need to watch out that you don't put it anywhere you don't want to put it and stuff like that so that's why really.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   We say the quantum blog is way easier to handle if you want to choose frequencies and with charging just in the infinity block make sure you're you stay wrong with it and don't forget your stuff in there.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Okay now I did see on telegram that you had mentioned that someone was looking to charge some aluminum bars to strap onto their water pipes right and you'd said that you know for aluminum bars.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   You'd want to go 30 minutes so that was a cue block.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   So what would you like putting in an aluminum bar in an infinity block.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   How long would that take that you don't want like what's the time you don't want to go over.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Yeah so that's pretty much what we would also recommend for phones iPads laptops for example 30 seconds is is enough to have it already fully optimized harmonized and.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   And radiate this energy or you can leave it in there for five to ten minutes.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   And then you're you're you're still good with that and I would not put these bars then again in your quantum block or in any lower.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   In infinity blocks just out of precautions but that's not the purpose of that usually anyway it's just we we say that and you can use it afterwards.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Okay so it has to do so it has to do with the quantum consciousness levels because if you want to use those aluminum bars or plates for example.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   And wrap them around a water pipe for example you can get some extra quote unquote power by just leaving it in a little bit longer.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   It's not necessary it's not necessary.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   You're saying five to ten minutes for a bar like something a big thick metal thing inside the infinity block.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Is that five to ten minutes for that 30 seconds for lecture max max the five to five to ten minutes absolute max.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Okay all right and then keep it away from the key block okay cool.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Yeah and shoes are different again so shoes so with shoes are you know if I mean if you have metal shoes it will be different things but you don't have metal shoes.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   So shoes are different because they're very connected to the earth energy and you walk around with them constantly you run.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   And first of all even takes dynamic quantum energy static the quantum energy or suppressed quantum energy wouldn't even work it would just leave the shoes fairly quickly after like 12 hours.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   So you can class I permanently charge the shoes with the quantum block or with infinity block and for the infinity block we would say you know 10 to 30 minutes.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   I'll leave your shoes in there and then you're good to go and we don't know long term yet how long the quantum energy stays in the shoes so we're already in like a month and a half.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   And in all of the shoes that we've tested or are testing and there has not been any degradation whatsoever so it's looking pretty good.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   All right cool all right so last question on the infinity block was in the last interview you'd mentioned that when you lay the cue create products that you put the you basically started the cue block.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   You put the frequency and the energy into an item whether it's a dog collar or a cup or whatever and you put that in the cue block but then you mentioned to that then you kind of quote finish it off and you put it in the infinity block.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   So I was wondering like wow what what what what does that do you know how does that you know what does that do that makes it different than just using the cue block I mean it's kind of are you just like okay could you explain why you guys do that.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   So just just from the energy perspective to get the same vibration you don't have to put it in a quantum plug before.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   But when we deal with frequencies we only and exclusively use the the quantum blocks energy for you know the the basis of the process if you will so let's say we create a frequency card.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   We do that in the quantum block but then we add higher vibration by putting it also into the infinity block.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   If you had a blank card with no frequency in it you could put it into the infinity block right away so because if I charge a blank card in a quantum block let's say for three minutes.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And then I put it into the infinity block seconds.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   It will have the same result as if I took another blank card and just put it into the infinity block for ten seconds.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Okay.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Okay all right thanks but you know I'm sorry I had one more question no one's asked this but I've been wondering and if you could just explain something new real quick and then let's jump into the test results.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   But you mentioned on Telegram that you could take the the broads out and you could separate the plates to charge larger objects right.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   And so the cue block could go up to five meters which 15 feet.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   But if you did that with the infinity block you know there I don't even know could you even do that with the infinity block based on its architecture.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Yes it's possible it's.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   You just have to figure out a way to keep the three together right.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Yeah I mean that's not too hard I mean you know you're a tinkerer obviously you know I would trust that you put it down in a minute.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Yeah I would just.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Exactly you put something in between you want to keep keep the distance there.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   But that's relatively easy because you can still use the nuts and the nuts have the distance that it needs.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Right.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   And then you just would you know you could use a little bit of tape or something else you know you're creative to do that and then you can move it apart as well.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   And with the quantum blog we said you can take these plates apart for at least five meters and you will still have exactly the same strength and a completely stable field in between.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Okay.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   And with the infinity block we don't even know how far you can take it apart.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   We'll be testing this.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   Okay.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   So once I have an update on that I can report out but at this point we say also at minimum five meters.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   So and okay I mean maybe you want to put your whole house in there.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   Yeah I want to charge my car.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   That's easy then.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Okay so you have to you have to make sure that the gaps have to remain.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   So you need to you need to so if you would take this thing apart to charge a big thing you have to make sure that there's a space in between the plates.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   You can't just have all three plates sandwiched together right.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Exactly.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Maintain the space.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   Okay so now my other question is what does the field look like so I made diagrams.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   So I was up last night trying to figure out how to explain this.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   So if this was like a you know a cube lock with two bars and you're saying it's 18.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   I measured it.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   It's 18 centimeters between the plates.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   Right.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   So let's say I wanted to lay down flat and charge my body.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Okay.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   And this would be you know typical six feet human.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   And so if I wanted to do this and I wanted to charge my body because this came up in telegram as well.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   Right.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   How do you charge your whole body.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   This is my question though.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   Does the field look like this with the red lines where it's only within the eight inches of the plates.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   Right.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000]   So that only I would only be able to charge my center self and not maybe my belly.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Or does the field kind of like elliptical like this the sun you know like the quantum sun.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   So that's my question is does the field encompass my whole body when the when the plates are separated.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   Or is the field only going to be between the plates.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   This here this this is how we see that.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   Okay.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   So if I wanted to charge my higher body then I need to then move this thing like I need to charge for.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   I guess three minutes that way and then three minutes this way.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   And that way you get your whole body in it right.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   Theoretically yes but practically that's not needed just because you will cover already so much of your body that it really doesn't matter because once you have so many the majority basically of your cells in between this field.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   It's you know there's there's communication between all of the cells and you basically get this effect in your whole body.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   You get the bulk of your body is okay so yeah so for you guys that are asking the question how do I charge my whole body I want to you know I want to elevate my energy and raise my frequency.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   This is how you do it you just lay down and put one plate on each side of you.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   Foot to toe and then I guess we're we'd also talked about putting your head in there if you just wanted to you know charge your brain.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   I guess you're you did a test right and it's okay and there's no ill effects and you could literally put your head in the cube lock and you'd be good.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   Right in terms of what on their teeth right because the metal picks up the energy and they and it stays with you right so my only caution I guess would be you don't want to put a frequency into your teeth because you may not want that frequency all the time like sleep and rest or
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   inner piece you might want a different frequency like a golf club would that be with it accurate.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   Yeah so yeah so so the thing is with everything in the body is you don't really have to worry about frequencies because the body can just regulate all of that so your bones wouldn't permanently be charged with a certain frequency for example
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   like as soon as you don't want that anymore don't need any more you can just basically kick it out.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   It's different if we're talking about like a gold filling or something like that and with with the quantity that's why we don't recommend it neither officially nor inefficiently at this point at least is that we don't have enough.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Yeah test results in regards to what happens with fillings and with you know if you have a screw in your elbow or something like that.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   We do know that it certainly harmonizes and neutralizes any negative frequencies off let's say aluminum that you may have in there or it would enhance the gold certainly it does all of these things.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   However since that is permanent we don't yet know is this negative in any way that it would be for example to stimulating we at this point don't think so actually because we don't use any brute force so it may actually be fantastic
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   you know and I can say that my wife crew for example was one of the ones actually testing this and she can see and feel that there's a gold filling that she has but that actually really enhanced this whole thing and it's just helping her
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   and their positive effect on the nervous system she was immediately able to see and notice that things like that but we still want to do more tests because this is something we don't want to tell or say lightly here.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   So from a tinker standpoint because that's my number one goal is a not only raise my frequency my whole body frequency but the you know the metal in my teeth I don't have any amalgams but I've got gold I got one gold filling
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   and I know I don't want to put a frequency in it and I know that if I charge metal it's going to hold the energy I also know that my body regenerates so that every 7 years and even faster for different depending on what part of your body you literally replace it you are completely a new human every 7 years every single cell in your body is replaced right so so I know that if you charge yourself you need to charge yourself often
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   so that you want if you want to have your soft tissue and bones maintaining that energy because you constantly are shedding old old cells and getting new cells right growing new cells but if the metal will keep the energy I guess that's the key
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   and then you're saying also to and I think this is what's really important is that it neutralizes the negative frequencies of toxic materials and toxic metals that's the theory right
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   yes absolutely and that's actually the case in practicality we've we've tested that multiple times that's also one of the studies that we did yep
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   so let's get into studies but I want to just emphasize what that means is that you know we are we are constantly being poisoned I mean food water air everything in our environment is poisoned to us
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   at this stage of of the planet okay Fukushima classic example you name it Florida in the water it's horrible but but this is a way if you're concerned about like let's say you know the aluminum in all of the different
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   deodorants and beauty products the lead in the beauty products I mean I was reading something the other day full of words like an average 30 year old female by the time that they hit 30 has consumed about three pounds of lead
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   if they're actively putting makeup on every day because they're so wild and make up and can you imagine that three pounds crazy up you know that they that they've exposed their their body to because the skin just you know is your largest body organ right so you're sucking in all that lead
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   if you look at all your deodorants and things like that they have aluminum you know so but this is one way you can neutralize it especially anything that goes up into your brain you can neutralize the heavy metals and also the plastics and the chemicals and all those other things so
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   that's one of the my major interest in this technology is is doing that so that I can you know basically raise my vibration and neutralize the negativity stuff so let's talk about test results because this is where the proof it's the is in the pudding
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   so Philip you basically had a huge set of test results and if you go to the website at Layla Q you can go right here under research studies and certificates okay and I just really want to emphasize this because this is the only place that I've seen you know in terms of like energy workers
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   energy devices and that have all of this testing I mean this is all third party different organ you know different institutes doing all these different tests on the different products that are being sold and so and this is and you can go and click on all of this and read the reports
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   and so now I got a new set over here of tests that you just had done and that you shared with me and I really really want to share this with everybody so that that I mean it's just unbelievable the results that you're getting
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   and that's why I'm so excited about this because it's not just you claiming this stuff you know in woo woo fashion which is like 99% of what you see on the Internet is like oh buy this crystal and you know or buy this sticker put it on your phone and blah blah blah
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   you know it's like right I mean it's like okay well you know prove it and nobody and nobody has this nobody has this and so it's so cool and that's what I'm really into that so but let's talk about the test results
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   and first what first thing I want to do is say you know could you explain like the newest test results are centered around you know measuring bio energetics and using dark field microscopy
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   right and that you've now gotten certificates from the BESA BESA Institute so first of all could you kind of share with the audience like who is the BESA Institute
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   and then let's talk about the types of studies that you're about to now release onto the website so you're going to add more studies
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   yes exactly and thanks for bringing that up and the website in that sense is not up to date because it doesn't contain any of these new ones and please give us you know in the next two three weeks to upload that
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   so the BESA Institute is in Austria and it's the largest testing and research institute in Europe in regards to biofeedback and testing and research bio energetic system analysis and they use an advanced
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   valdica method and you know more about the valdica method than I do at least you can explain it way better than I do and then in addition we focus now also on dark field microscopy
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   that is something that is actually not done by the BESA Institute it is done by a doctor's office or doctors practice also in Austria and it's just been coordinated by the BESA Institute
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   so that that is what what we've done as well because we wanted to we knew about the results but we wanted to also come up with visuals
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   right one thing is that yeah this woo aspect and yes we have these healers and certainly everybody else that can see energy can see what these products do but we wanted to make the scientific
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   proof also available in forms of studies then you have a lot of people that are interested in studies and they may enjoy your video but they wouldn't go in and read you know 30 40 50 pages of studies
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   but then the great way to do it is actually to show a before and after picture of the actual blood of people and we're also not done with this we're going to continue to test certain things and I think that's a great way
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   and the dark field microscopy has been used for many many years by thousands and thousands of doctors and alternative health practitioners all over the world it's a great tool to assess what's going on in the body
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   and yeah there has just been a recent great interview that you actually share with me that also explains that maybe that's actually something that may be interesting for the people in the telegram group also
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   it's just a great tool you can see things and you know typically how doctors and healing practitioners in Europe work with the dark field microscopy is they take that sample they look at it and then they assess
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   and then they come up with a game plan on what can be done what needs to be changed in that person's life maybe diet changes lots of other changes supplements etc.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   to try to improve that blood over a period of weeks months or you know and in some cases a half year a year
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   and you will see now that this technology works almost instantly so we can maybe go into some of those pictures but it's pretty telling how fast
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   the blood improves in a way where we haven't seen it before okay so there's okay so we're going to share two different methodologies and we're going to keep it short because you know if you want to know more read the study
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   they're all going to there's a set already posted on the website there's going to be a new set which is what you're looking at right now the two different methodologies is measuring the human bio fields reaction to stimulus
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   and the other one is dark field microscopy which is more traditional science using microscopes and so we're going to start with the dark field microscopy so basically the test was
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   is somebody comes in and they basically take a blood sample and then then you know they take a picture of the blood and then they are exposed to a Leleque cue block or a Leleque product
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   and then they take another blood sample to take a look at what happened with the blood okay so I just want to show some before and afters just so you can kind of get a feeling for it so
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   and then and then again what Philip reference is it's just serendipity where I don't know if you've ever heard of the blog called electric sense it's something I've been following for a long time
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   and and he then this is gentleman who's very electric sensitive and he's all about EMF EMF electoral smog 5g all that type of understanding the science and then understanding how to mitigate it from a brute force standpoint using shielding using
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   you know literally just you know shielding I mean you know and blocking literally blocking the radio waves from coming to the body is where his science stops but you know but the idea here
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   is that this interview popped up with a doctor I think Beverly Rubik and she's a university scientist who's been studying this kind of stuff forever and she actually started talking about the EMF effect on our bodies and what happens and this is what you're looking at
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   we're all smothered in electro smog and so this is a before picture of a participant a test participant's blood prior to actually being exposed to the lay the quantum block and what you're looking at is the dark field microscopy picture
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   and these little circles are red blood cells and they're all stuck together which means low oxygen adjacent oxen is just a tease but you know low I never can get that word right
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   but the whole idea is that the blood your blood cells are stuck together the coagulated the white blood cells are not flowing freely and it's it's very it's not healthy blood it's not terminal but it's not healthy blood and this is your standard person
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   everyday right because of the just you Wi-Fi cell phones and all of that and so what happens and this is what's amazing is this is the before picture of a person's blood
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   before Layla and then this is what happens when you have Layla this is five minutes and look what happens to the blood this is a physical reaction to the lay the quantum block all of a sudden the red blood cells
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   detach from each other it in massively increases the surface area and the blood starts free flowing white blood cells start flowing and then all of a sudden you have you're getting a lot more oxygen in the blood
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   and the and the energetic level of your your body increases so is it could you add anything more to that I mean can I did I cover it
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   I think you covered it really well what we can say is that this person is living a relatively conscious life so it's not one of those very sick people that's why the picture before wasn't even that bad before you
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   right so you see where you see these like they call them money rolls where that's really what is is over concern also where the blood gets thick and certainly then you have much much higher risk to for anything
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   hard related you know my heart issues harder text strokes things like that and indeed this within five minutes and the person that we may want to mention that as well put both hands in the quantum block for five minutes
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   that's what they did okay probably would be enough to put just one hand in it but just you know for the accuracy it was two hands in this example
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   and we've tested lots of different people healthy people sick people women man and so on and I think you know your next example I haven't seen it yet but I'm guessing that that was a sicker person
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   so yeah I'll tell you what for anyone who's interested and this is so important and I cannot emphasize enough about how every single one of us who cares about our health needs to understand what electro smog is doing to you what EMFs are doing to you
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   especially this issue about 5g okay and and what it's doing to you it's it's messing with your blood and it's coagulating your blood and so what I'm going to do is if you look in the video description
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   I'll put a link to that interview over at the electro sense blog of the doctor Beverly Rubitt okay and what she's going to do if you listen to her interview with with Lloyd at that blog
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   you're going to hear this scientist this doctor explain what the health effects of having this type of blood is to you long term and it's detrimental
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   they've tied this type of unhealthy blood to numerous health issues to that that will cause you over long term will cause you to be sickly and and and bad health
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   so it's so incredibly important to have healthier blood and here's one way to do it so this is what's amazing about the serendipity of that interview being released yesterday as I was building this deck
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   you know for this interview so it's just so amazing but yeah I really highly recommend go to the link below listen to that interview about and understand what having this type of blood is doing to your health
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:41.000]   and when that and that is specifically related to what EMF is doing to you so this is the before this is the after and then now this is another one and so this is the before picture of a sicklier individual right
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   and this is before they put on the Leila quantum jacket okay you know you have Leila shirts and Leila hats and things but I'm actually wearing one right now
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   but you have a Leila quantum jacket that this individual put on so this is before and you can see a light a lot more tighter clusters and less red blood cells in this sample and then so this is it and then what they did was they put on the Leila quantum jacket
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:17.000]   right and then they wore it for 15 minutes and then they took another blood sample so could you talk to this Phillip?
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   yes so so the quantum jacket by the way is one that we've been working on for quite some time and it will be released probably over the next two three weeks actually this will be a Kickstarter campaign so just giving a little teaser here
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   and it contains a very special and very very high quality silver fabric all the way in the inside and then we've charged it with quantum energy
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   now this person indeed if you go back to the before picture is actually one that has the sea disease and it really is not very good blood at all and if you just look to the next picture again
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   yes so for 15 minutes then this person wore this jacket and you can see an absolutely amazing and very very visible improvement of the blood
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   it was yeah really stunning almost on you know how instant this works and yeah it certainly is not perfect at that point but it's so way better that yeah I hope you can drive your own conclusions we don't want to say too much we certainly also want to say that we're not in the medical field and we have our disclaimers
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   and everything our products are not there to heal or diagnose any disease but it's quite telling you know what you can do to improve your well-being
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   yeah yeah please listen to that other interview for that doctor and you'll understand how important this is to your health but this is amazing Phillip I mean this is amazing that you have physical evidence now of the effect of your products
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   and I'm just amazed and I was just looking at all of this last night and I was I'm just blown away I'm literally blown away because I know of only a few other things that will do this
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   and like PMF is one you know we actually induce you know basically pulse electromagnetic frequency and pulse that into the body and pump the body full of electrons and then raise the ATP level will do this but to actually just have an object
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   this is this is what's amazing everyone an object right basically put your hand inside of this object right and then having that happen is just unbelievably amazing so that is the dark field microscopy
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   evidence the testing that's been done with Leila so let's talk about the other one which is the bio energetics and I just want to you know we're getting at the hour mark so I want to just not make to this too long but I do want to cover the bio energetics and that's
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   with BESA right our BESA and and and how that how those tests were done was a person would walk in and get evaluated with their bio energetics meaning they're measuring their bio field and it's done with the device called the deco vol and is developed by German physicists and they're going goes on and on and on but it's an actual real thing
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   and so and they're using devices to measure the body's response to stimulus okay so they walk in they check them just right off the street just like the before right off the street they take you know how are you doing today boom they test them
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   then they expose them to the stimuli and the stimuli is EMF or multiple different types of things that are that are like toxic and then whatever but you know not not in a harmful way but mainly though they just go like they expose them to a Wi-Fi router or a cell phone like hold the cell phone for 15 minutes
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   and then let's measure you now and then while they're holding this the cell phone or the Wi-Fi or they're exposed then they're exposed also at the same time to lay less you can kind of get a feel for they walk in fresh off the street they expose them to stimulus negative stimulus
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   and then while they're holding the Leila like a pendant or a sweater or whatever right then they're there they then they expose them again and they measure it and so in those tests that are done here's one and there's multiple ones and they'll be here's a whole list of them right but they'll be put up on the website but you can I'm gonna kind of just jump ahead to kind of get everyone understanding how a deco vol works so the deco vol works and it's basically
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   measures the bio the bio field's response and it's just and so I'm just gonna go and really simply the colors the colors it's makes it simple to kind of read but green is optimal this is your optimal most healthiest you know you know energetic response that you could give that your body's running at optimal levels right blue means that you're generative you're struggling and then if you get into red means it's dangerous
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   it means it's danger zone you know so you don't even so that's kind of what it here you know the different colors so now you could read the whole report but what I want to point out here is at the bottom of the report they do kind of a comparison
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   okay so what I want to point out is this and Philip jump in when they walk in off the street when you're there's basically just kind of like not sub sub optimal okay they're just basically not healthy but not not not dangerously unhealthy
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   it's just kind of like there and it's all blue right the results are all blue and then they expose them to the wifi and you can see that now all of a sudden now they're picking up a level of dangerous you know element to their to their bio field
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   in other words the body's responding and saying oh you know a danger danger right it's like this is not good for me and then once they once they get exposed to the Leila Quantum Block not only do they overcome the negative stimulus of the of the wifi router
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   but they also raise their you know their bio field response to the stimulus to the all of the stimulus around them and they have a positive response so that the deco volt measuring device picks up that now they're in optimal so it raised them
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   this is my point it raised them to optimal even even in the in the presence of wifi so the it's yeah so I mean that's just I mean could you kind of add is there anything I mean what would you say to that I mean and they did that multiple different times to different parties
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   and look every single time they went from you know suboptimal oh here's the red now that here's the why they turned the wifi on and their body was like danger danger and then all of a sudden with Leila after a few minutes boom they're just it's completely reversed
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   so what would you say to that Philip? Yes absolutely so that's what they do they measure the state of the body and it is very telling that people are impacted already just by the general environmental factors right so when they walk in even if you live a relatively conscious life
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   you're still hit by all these things that you know are in the food or in the air that the EMF that you reference to certainly and yeah so most people just are not at an optimal state and it's great to see that with this type of energy device you can uplift all of your body and energetic functions
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   in a very very quick time frame so yes we're absolutely happy to see this here and that also means that there's a there's a way to deal with all this stuff right I want to point out certainly that
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   it is possible to do this and to deal with all those negative frequencies and air pollution etc with just your own vibration if you raise your own vibration if you become more conscious more connected with yourself I always want to continue to say that because
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   that's really what we want to tell people also that you can do this however most of us need these bridges need these tools to get there and certainly one way is locking yourself off completely against all of that don't eat anything anymore like shield your whole home like just
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   put yourself in a silver suit and stuff like that but that's really not life anymore so with this here you can still do pretty much everything you can while at the same time you're you're giving your body the opportunity to be in a great state so it can focus again on its original function
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   and doesn't have to deal so much with all these environmental stress factors
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:46.000]   yeah it's you know this is amazing yeah and here's just I just want to say this is a 57 page report and there's dozens of these so this is a very well documented very well tested you know product you know this is what's amazing to me
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   so I just I really want to point this out that if you go to the website there's just tons and tons of evidence not just using a deco vol measuring bio energetics in our last video that we did about test results
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:15.000]   Philip and I walk through tests that were done with heart rate variability which is another mainstream academic measuring tool for health so and then of course now you've got dark field microscopy so you've got all of these different third party testing
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   and that's the thing I really want to stress is that this isn't woo woo magic this is real this is real and and and what it can do for your health is amazing so you know thank you Philip for just you know for bringing this out to the market
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   but all of this stuff I guess is going to be eventually posted on the website so that anyone's interested can also go and and you know take a look at all the research studies and certificates if you want to if you want to find out for yourself you know how real is this please I encourage you to do so
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   so Philip us we're rounding out the hour I do want to just kind of just talk about how can you know like what is there I know that there's an offer right now so if you go to the website
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   the infinity block could you kind of talk about what when you said there was an offer about one versus two and so forth you know like like where to reach you and purchase instructions if people are interested in getting this and then
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   really it's like the cue blocks also for sale as well right so go aim go ahead just make sure people know if they're interested let me just kind of back up a step yeah if they're interested you just go to the product page there's the quantum block
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   and now they're at this cue block and you kind of just talk about that. Yes so first of all I encourage everybody that hasn't joined our telegram group to go ahead and do that it's super interesting a lot of fun and amazing people there that are all sharing and learning and experiencing
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   and helping with you know everything around this topic and more actually and I K typically has the invite link and the video description so if you don't know how to get there you'll find it probably there and yeah so there's still the launch discount for the quantum
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   block that you can see there that's active on the website and then for the infinity block you can purchase one and the price for that one is 1599 but you can also get it as a package which then enables you to infinitely upgrade your
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   infinity blocks again we said with caution in the beginning but this is something long term right even in 40 years you could still upgrade it and that prices 2499 for both of those so you basically get that package
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   and yeah there's for some older customers we have we have some special that I guess we'll talk about in the telegram group and that's about it. Oh you can also by the way there on the description you find the measurements just so if you wonder how big is this thing actually
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   okay yeah it's I think eight by eight by a little bit over nine inches. Okay yeah so I'll post a link to the quantum power telegram chat group in the video description and what Philip just said is something really important. If you're interested in these products you're interested in learning more come join and just jump in and just read or post and contribute and just feel free everyone's welcome.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   I mean really everyone is welcome. And the thing about that being in that group though is that Philip and you know it just is so generous but he'll have giveaways every month there's some kind of a giveaway contest and then other months there's discounts
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   and so and those are not those are that's the only place you're going to hear about them so if you're interested that's where you want to hang out and yeah you're going to get some really great offers to the group so come join us on telegram learn more about it feel free to ask questions.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   So you can reach me there also directly because you asked how can people reach me so in telegram I'm active there so you'll find me you can ask questions there for you know questions for everybody or for me and then you can send private messages as well and if you just don't have telegram
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   or don't know how to do that then certainly you can also send an email that would just go to info@lilaq.com info@lilaq.com and you'll also get answers.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   Okay, so that's how you contact Philip I'll just it's going to be either a telegram or through the website if you have any questions at all you know just jump in and ask.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:58.000]   And if you want to learn more come join the come join the group the website is called lilaq.com and this is the beautiful front page of it if it pops up quickly.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   Anything else you want to add Philip.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:14.000]   I think we've we've covered it you know people let us know if you have any questions check it out and yeah we welcome your input and your curiosity.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000]   And thank you very much cave for setting this up here.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   Hey thank you so all right everyone thank you so much for spending a little bit of time with Philip and I and learning a little bit about the infinity block and all these incredible test results.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   Appreciate your time today and Mahalo thank you very much.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   Bye Philip.
