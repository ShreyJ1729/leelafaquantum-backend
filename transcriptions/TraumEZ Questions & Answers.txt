[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   on this. Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host, Kay Elmer,
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.320]   and I've got Philip von Holtzendorf, Liba Quantintek, and quantum upgrade and trauma,
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.080]   trauma-ease harmonizer, on the call with me to answer some questions that you have,
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.920]   that you have posted on Telegram regarding the new trauma-easey harmonizer service.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.200]   And so now it's been three weeks exactly that it's been out there, and I have been
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.320]   dutifully writing down or saving all of the different questions posted on Telegram.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.280]   I did do my best to weed out the redundant ones. And then so I'm just going to basically be throwing
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.920]   these questions out at Philip and picking his mind for the next hour and kind of answer as many
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.920]   of these as we can get to before we run out of time. So does that sound good, Philip?
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.640]   Sounds amazing. Okay, number one, if I first take out the one for single,
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.120]   then switch to family, right? So if I subscribe for single, then I decide to do my whole family,
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.640]   do I have to pay the $35 a set up fee twice?
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:15.920]   I think yes, I think I've answered that before somewhere, but yes, and the reason is because there's
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:23.920]   real effort behind it. So it's just real effort to, that we need to work on to get the family members
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.760]   activated. Okay, so if you have exactly it, so yeah.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.480]   Okay, and then so now number two, once you know, how do I add or remove phone numbers
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.240]   for traumesee? Like, let's say I set up one phone and I get a different phone number,
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.360]   how do I change the number for the service? You work with customer service, you can't do
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.760]   anything in that regard, so if you change your phone number, you need to speak with customer.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.720]   So as in there, they'll be happy to do it for you. Okay, great. Number three, can the phone numbers
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.440]   be swapped again and again if you take the family package? I don't really understand the
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.560]   question, but the same answer every family member can have their phone number. And if any family
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.600]   member changes the phone number, then of course, you can have the new phone number, but you need
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.240]   to work with customer service on that, but no extra costs. You know, there's also no extra
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.600]   activation fee in that case then. Okay, great. Number four, if your phone already has the
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.760]   quantum upgrade subscription, can it also get the traumesee energy, or is it only one of the
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.680]   services at a time? You can also get the traumesee. And we specifically tested that, so it's totally
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.240]   fine to do that. And one doesn't cancel out the other. And one also doesn't really do what the
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.800]   other one does. So as I mentioned before, the quantum upgrade for your phone does a whole lot,
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.360]   but it doesn't cover the trauma part, right? So if you want to work on traumas, then
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.840]   yeah, just book the traumesee as well. Okay, all right, good. Okay, number five is the baseline
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.480]   positive energy for traumesee somehow a different life force energy. I'm guessing a life different
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:25.920]   than QE, QU. Or just yeah, they're asking, is the traumesee energy different than
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.000]   Q, you know, quantum upgrade slash product, you know, quantum energy?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.920]   Well, it's it's not the same and it's also not different. Now I don't have anyone
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.520]   back and they're probably it's think of it as a completely different set of frequencies that's
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.720]   also delivered in a different way. Okay, but it's still all working with the quantum space and
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.840]   working with frequencies as well. Okay, but it's not a frequency itself. Like you don't have like a
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.600]   trauma frequency that you can add to quantum upgrade, right? No, actually, it's an energy.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.840]   Yeah, right. It's an energy that's resonating at a frequency. It's a little bit different,
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.960]   but it works. So okay, hopefully that answered that question, because I'm yeah, I'm trying to
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.280]   wrap my head around that thing too. Okay, number six, the question mark about children. We've got
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.560]   several questions from parents who have children, little guys. And so if the kid is too little to
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.120]   kind of understand, you know, they can't do the nine step process themselves, right?
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.920]   What do you recommend for children? Well, so if it was my kid, then I would
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.040]   if the kid is open to doing that, then I would do it with the kid, basically. And
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.280]   you know, I would read the steps I would place the phone word needs to be placed. I would
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   basically guide the kid in that sense, maybe in a playful way. And you know, I think if you want to
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:05.120]   do it, then ideally the parent does it that has the most, you know, the best connection to the kid
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.520]   for something like this. Okay, because usually kids don't really like to concentrate or focus on
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:18.000]   something. So right. Yeah, but it's definitely possible. Okay, great. Yeah, so yeah, so just give
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.080]   it a try, everybody. And then you be their guide, right? Okay, number seven, if I gift or include
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.840]   someone in my family subscription, a trauma easy, but putting in their phone number, does your system
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.240]   send them a text confirmation to let them know they've been added? No, we don't do that. We don't
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:44.720]   send any, any activation notices whatsoever. It is basically happening. When, whenever it's
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:52.000]   signed up, then within 10 to 30 minutes, it is activated. Okay, so yeah, so then if you did that
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.760]   for someone, you need to let them know. Okay, number eight, could workers in an animal shelters
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:09.040]   apply trauma easy and the steps to help animals? Oh, like this is energy work by itself with a
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.760]   being that's not no speaking. No, I mean, it would have a positive impact. But for that, you wouldn't
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.480]   really need this then for that I would I would use the quantum upgrade, right? Definitely for the
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.240]   location where you have the horses or the cows or whatever, use the quantum upgrade for location.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.400]   That would be the deal. But but the trauma easy. Yeah, that's that's just too difficult
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.360]   because you would have to go through the steps really and then the horse can't really do that.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.200]   Yeah, okay, that makes sense. A good, good comment though, use quantum
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.640]   upgrade instead. Okay, number nine, well, the quantum field ability to charge and frequencies
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.200]   extend outwards like normal if the phone is sealed in a faraday bag.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.160]   Yes, that doesn't have an impact because that's below subatomic. Okay. And what you what you
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:08.000]   stop with with a third a cage is really electromagnetic radiation. And that's pretty much it. So it'll
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.360]   still work, right? The trauma easy will still work inside of one of those RFID blocker things,
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:21.360]   right? Yes, however, I would I would if I if I do the work, I would definitely pull it out and
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.120]   upset that before to others when they ask. So I have this magnetic
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:32.640]   pouch, you know, whatever, you know, I would definitely always remove it. If I do the work and
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:39.600]   just just use the phone as is without any of these magnetic things or other pouches.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.840]   Okay, good point. Thanks. Number 10, if I add the fifth person in a family package later,
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:51.760]   okay, we answered that one. Okay, wait, if I sign I guess this means if they signed up for a family
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.800]   package, they only had four people in the beginning, and then now they want to add a fifth one,
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.600]   they just put in the number, right? They don't have to pay a set up fee, right? It's a one time
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:10.560]   set up fee fee per year. But as you add people or switch people, that's not going to charge another
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:16.720]   35. Is that correct? Exactly. That's already included. You just work with customer service and then
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:23.600]   I'll go home. Okay, okay, so number 11 is the trauma that is being resolved primarily emotional
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:31.360]   energetic with physical manifestations, or can it also support resolution of primary physical traumas
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:39.040]   like malign injections, heavy metal poisoning accidents. So like what like what kind of traumas
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:45.680]   it all it's just going to be emotional energetic trauma, not physical bodily injury trauma, right?
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:56.160]   Well, it's emotional and energetic, which then can actually cause physical symptoms. So those
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.800]   would be included. But if we're just talking of physical impact, I don't know, I hit my head on
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.440]   the brake and I don't know, I have a huge concussion or something like that. And that's a traumatic
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:17.600]   experience. That was very physical. Well, it can probably help a little bit with that, but it's
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:23.920]   not like the healing solution for your concussion if that makes sense. So it really, I would rather
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:30.880]   look at it on an energetic and an emotional level. But those, again, they can have physical
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:38.320]   symptoms as a result. Okay. Yes. Okay. All right. So but not meant to, you know, heal physical trauma,
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.920]   I mean, physical like one froze trauma, broken bones, things like that. Okay. So just, okay,
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:49.200]   I get it. Hopefully that was clear to everybody. Okay. So number 12, is there an audio version of
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:55.760]   the PDF steps available? Okay. So that one's been answered. The answer is yes, there's you did create
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:03.920]   an audio guide, right? But and it was, it was a link on one of the versions of the PDF, like the
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.600]   steps, right? But I looked at the most recent one and I didn't see the link to the thing anymore.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:19.680]   So how do people get it? That's the great question. So, okay. So in other words, we should
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:26.560]   it will be, it should be posted there. If it's not there, then this is the newest running soon
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:34.720]   again. Okay. So this is the newest link. If you go to the website and there was a link to an audio
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:43.360]   file on an earlier version of this that's gone now. So okay. All right. So so this is the most recent
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:50.240]   PDF. I believe that you added some clarification to one of these steps, right? We're gonna go on
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.040]   sidebar real quick. Because you mentioned to me last week that there was something you guys
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:02.640]   realize you left out, so you added something to the steps. Yeah, that is in step number six. Okay,
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.880]   which is actually, I find it quite important to actually go through it like that, because
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:15.520]   for whatever reason that one tiny paragraph had fallen off and what you need to do in the end of
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:22.480]   step six is also you go down from, let's say you're, you feel that the, the heaviness of the trauma
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:30.240]   is at a 10. When you, in the process, you count down basically all the way to zero until there's
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:37.440]   nothing left that you can feel or observe in terms of that trauma. And it's, it's, it's absolutely
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.360]   recommended to do that in step six as well, as well as in the one step before, I think maybe
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:49.360]   step four, where you're also counting down from 10 to zero, because that way you're really covering
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:56.400]   all of the different levels. Okay. Okay. So, okay. So that's a good point, everybody, that the step,
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:02.800]   step six has been updated. This is the most recent off the website, but it's missing the audio. So
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.840]   what I'll do for anybody that wants that audio, I'll go ahead and put it in the video description
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:13.280]   until such time, you could just grab it off the website. So there's an audio guide that, that,
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:17.280]   you know, verbally walks you through, you know, like guided meditation kind,
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.720]   that'll, that'll walk you through the 12 steps, but just make sure that if you haven't downloaded
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.640]   the most recent version of the steps, go to the website and get the newest copy for the complete
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:35.280]   step six. Okay. Now, number 13, if I put my phone, oh, here's another, okay, this, you know, this came
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:40.480]   up. This is actually my question, because it came up in a discussion about how do I pause this,
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.960]   you know, because like one person felt really, really like this, it was really strong for them,
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:50.000]   right? And so they're like, how do I pause trauma, you know, the trauma easy energy, like they,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.800]   you know, like you would do with quantum upgrade, right, you can pause it. And I was like, and I
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.120]   told them, I didn't know if you could pause it, maybe you could use that purple pouch, but it wasn't
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:05.840]   sure. So two questions, how do you pause it? If, or could, you know, if you had a purple pouch,
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.680]   would that work? If I put my phone in a purple pouch, would that pause the trauma easy energy?
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:20.080]   It would not pause it, but it would contain it. And otherwise, you can't pause it. From my perspective,
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:27.200]   there's no need at all actually also to pause it, because it is not stimulating in any way, like
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:35.360]   you don't get anything in any way that why you wouldn't want that it only has harmonizing benefits
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:43.920]   basically. Okay, so it also isn't isn't at a strength level where anyone should have issues with that.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:52.640]   So that would be, that would be extraordinary. Okay, so if you, if somebody felt really
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:58.880]   strongly that they wanted to pause it, it's possible. So I'm just saying so it is possible to put it
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.960]   in a purple pouch that would contain that energy. Yes, that's kind of act like a pause, right?
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:12.640]   Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it would sort of act like a pause and just basically, it's like a sleeping bag.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:18.160]   Right. Okay. And if that wasn't enough, because you need to use your phone all the time, then maybe,
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:24.240]   yeah, then just, well, in that case, I would cancel it then, to be honest. That's what I was
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.360]   saying. Then if it's too much for you, if you feel that's too much for you, then just cancel it,
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:35.760]   you know, yeah, yeah, contact support. Okay. Number 14, is there a way to pause it? Number 15,
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:41.280]   would it be some kind of benefit if one of the persons doesn't want to do the work or believe
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:47.040]   on it? Would it still be some kind of benefit if one of the persons doesn't want to do the work
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:54.960]   or believe on it? Okay. So I think the question is, okay, I have a partner and I would really
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:01.440]   encourage this partner to work through this one trauma with this. And no, as if someone doesn't
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:08.080]   want to do the work at all and doesn't, and also doesn't believe in it, there's already a resistance
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:14.240]   against even acknowledging that there's a trauma and even acknowledging that they can work through
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:23.600]   the trauma. So no, in that case, it's like, you can't beat people to wake up or to do this or do
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:30.400]   that really. I mean, at least not with these types of inner processes, right? You just can't.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.120]   Someone needs to be willing to do that. And if they don't, then they are, then they just need
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:46.960]   to suffer more. That is unfortunately the truth. You know, you can offer all your help. But if they
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:53.360]   say no, then we need to respect that. And it's their path. And then maybe in their own timing,
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:59.360]   a week later or a year later or five years later, then they may be ready for that. And if you have
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.440]   at least shared what you have to share, then they can always come back to you and say, hey, you know,
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.480]   I'm ready. And you know, I'm realizing now I need to do something. And can you help me?
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:12.480]   Something like that works always better than just dragging people.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.760]   Yeah, yeah. And you know, we also manifest our own reality. So if your reality is it, this doesn't
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:23.520]   work. And it could work because you're the one in charge of it, of your reality. Right. Okay,
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.080]   number 16, what guidance do you have if someone is having a hard time feeling emotions related to
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.880]   the trauma? You know, based on the instructions, this is an essential step. And would, and this
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:38.320]   person would love some guidance if they're not able to conjure up the emotion of the trauma.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:46.640]   Yeah, so that's actually a quite good question. Because I feel that that several people may have
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:54.080]   this issue that they don't really, and especially man, then they, they are not so emotional usually.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:00.800]   And we try to not allow our emotions. And then we think we don't have any. And so
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:08.720]   there's a different way. You could just feel like the weight of it, or the, you know,
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.360]   that, you know, all these things, they're, it's pretty much the same thing, you know, so just
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:18.480]   early perceived in a different way. So if just something feels as if it, you know,
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.400]   limits your breath, or it just feels heavy, or you're like, you're getting super tired,
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.880]   you don't even want to think about this thing, because it's just, it's just, it's just such an
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:34.960]   effort. You know what I mean? That is the feeling you have. And it tells you like how,
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:42.480]   how powerful strong this, this trauma actually is. If it's totally easy and it's, wow, you're
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:48.080]   so light and it's all, you're so inner piece with it and whatever, then it's, then there isn't much
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.640]   at all, if anything, right? But if you have these feelings of tightness,
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.640]   heaviness, all of that, you can use that and then just let that come up. You know,
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.840]   it doesn't need to be a specific emotion. Yeah. I hope that helps.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.320]   No, no, that makes sense. Thanks. Okay. Number 17, similar question to above,
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:15.360]   but for unconscious traumas. How do you follow step two for feeling emotions for unconscious trauma?
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:27.280]   All right. So can we go to step number two real quick? Sure. Please, right here.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:39.040]   Okay. So, I mean, I think I also mentioned that before. So if we don't really know what the trauma
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:47.200]   is, I need to know something in order to do the work, right? And it can be a situation
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:55.280]   usually it would be a repetitive situation or a specific feeling or emotion of how I act or
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:05.440]   react. Let's say every time a bus drives around the corner and I see a bus, I'm like in a shock
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:12.880]   position. Like I can't move my breath stops. I'm just giving this example and you can apply to
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:20.080]   whatever. It's just a very extreme example. So you almost can't move anymore. But you don't know
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:25.120]   why that is or what's going on and that it always tends to happen. So then just
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:35.360]   define this occurrence and use that as the trauma. The trauma behind me always getting in a shock
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:44.000]   position when a bus comes, you know, whatever that is. Or whenever my boss enters my office,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:55.440]   I feel whatever caught even though I didn't do anything wrong. So then just describe that and
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:01.520]   then you have the trauma there. It's not you don't have to see the trauma and know where it came from
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:10.000]   because often we actually have no clue, right? But we still act because of traumatic experience. So
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.880]   if you just name the experience of what you struggle with, then that works as well.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:25.440]   Okay. All right. No, good advice. Thank you. Okay. Number 18, if you want to release an emotion
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:30.720]   when you are going through step five, should you focus on just one memory of that emotion?
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.800]   Well, let your mind wander through lots of memories of that emotion.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:43.680]   Whatever you feel like in that give moment. So because usually when you're sitting down or laying
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:50.320]   down to do this, you're really willing to do the work and to let go of things. And then
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:56.640]   you'll just know, you'll just know. Okay. And if you don't, if you feel you don't,
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:02.160]   and you just do it one way, then you feel, oh, maybe I missed something. So and then
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:09.920]   you'll do more. So you'll know, trust yourself. I think that's very important. We need to all
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:17.920]   start trusting ourselves more. Okay. No, thanks. Good advice. Number 19, for ancestral trauma,
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:23.520]   do you go through the steps once to heal all ancestral trauma? Or do you have to go through the
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:28.640]   steps to release each type of ancestral trauma, you know, one time through steps
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.000]   for releasing inherited anger, then another time for inherited depression, etc.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:44.720]   Well, I think it's hard to answer actually. So it really depends. And usually you can't do it all
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:50.240]   at once. Yeah, I was, you know, what, you know, because indeed there could be lots of different
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:55.200]   things that you inherited and
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:04.000]   you would have to go through each individual one usually. I mean, you can start with like a
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.040]   broader brush and see what that does. A broader brush would be, you know, the
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:17.120]   the biggest trauma I inherited. Yeah. I don't know from my parents or, but you know, I mean,
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:22.560]   especially that, you know, the the closer you get relative wise, like to your parents,
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:29.920]   for example, there's tons of stuff actually that we pick up from, from our parents. So, yeah,
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:36.640]   maybe a lot of work to be done. Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, I honestly like, you know, to share
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:42.080]   with people, you know, I've been working on things also from, from my childhood and it's,
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:49.040]   you know, it's, it's a long process. You know, you think you, you release it all and then like
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:56.240]   a year later, you notice something or someone else notices something. And, and, yeah, there's,
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:02.400]   there's just something new that just came came out or, or is, is not visible again. And you are
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:11.840]   at it again. I literally just did three Trump easy sessions last week regarding my mother.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:20.560]   Yeah. So, you know, it's, it's, you know, yeah, it keeps going. There's something comes up and,
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:26.160]   you know, you may think it's, it's, it's all done, but it's, it may not be. But the good thing is that
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.920]   the more you release the easier actually it gets and, yeah.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:39.840]   I hear you. I hear you. No one, no one ever had to pass a test to be a parent. They just got
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:45.680]   thrown into it. So everyone practices on your, you're constantly being practiced on. And the first
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:53.680]   kids usually throw away and then they get better as they have more kids. Okay. So by the way, also,
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:24:01.280]   it also doesn't. So with these things, it doesn't need to be that it was just such a super heavy
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.480]   trauma, right? Like, I mean, my, my mom never beat me up or something like that, right? But those,
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.880]   those cases exist, of course, and those are terrible and there's a lot to work on. But,
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:16.080]   but it can be really subtle things, right? And where, you know, maybe just little children just
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.960]   don't, they just take it in a different way. You know, if you had been treated as an adult,
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:26.560]   like that, you know, you probably wouldn't have taken away a trauma, right? Or you would have
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:34.080]   acted differently. But, but little kids, they, you know, they just take on things in a different
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:39.840]   way, especially from their parents, and they always want to make it right. And, and that's why we just
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:46.480]   absorb so much during that time. Yep. Yep. I hear you. Okay. Let's see. Number 20.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:52.720]   Is there a recommendation for using frequencies via the quantum upgrade when using trauma easy?
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:59.920]   Should we turn QU frequencies off when you're doing it? Or is there a frequency that would enhance it?
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:10.160]   It's a good question. Yeah. I actually didn't feel the need or so at all to make any changes,
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:17.600]   whatsoever. I don't think it really matters much. So from that perspective, just choose any
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:24.240]   frequency you want that you just feel good with, and it should be totally fine. Okay. And if you
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:29.680]   have them posted to set the quantum upgrade on neutral, then go ahead and do that. There's,
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:35.920]   there's no, no right or wrong. I've killed. Okay. Yep. That makes sense. Okay. So now 21,
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:41.040]   how many traumas are recommended to release in a day? I think you kind of answered this earlier.
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.480]   Well, yeah. I want to speak to it, though, also because
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:51.200]   I don't think there is an answer because it really, again, depends on the person,
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:57.840]   depends on the time, depends on the traumas. And the best answer really is just feel for yourself.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:07.200]   Don't rush it. Sometimes, you know, especially man, you know, have the attention. Okay. Well,
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.960]   I'm just going to release them all today. You know, I'm just going to start at a am and just
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:16.160]   go until nine p.m. And I'll just get through with it. You know, that's not how it works, because
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:23.040]   then we can't keep up. We can't keep up with it. And you may, you know, when I did these three traumas
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:29.760]   there that I just mentioned, I did in three days. And actually, then I felt like, oh my god, you know,
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:37.680]   I'm not going to do anything here in the next two days. So I really literally felt like I couldn't
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:44.800]   have done any other trauma in the next 48 hours after that. And I didn't even do all three
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:53.440]   on the same day, which you probably can. No problem. You know, and I've done, I've used the trauma
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:27:00.160]   easy also a few times a day already before, but usually I would say just really feel. Take your time
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:07.680]   with it. And once you've released something, note that there's always a process that's going on. It's
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:18.080]   so give yourself some time to relax, to reset and take it easy again, then go at it again.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:24.480]   That's what I would recommend. Okay, all right, that makes sense. Okay, number 22 triggers.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.040]   I know I have a few of those and they can bring the traumas back over and over. How do we clear
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:35.760]   them using trauma easy? So it's not about the trauma, but the triggers that trigger the trauma.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:42.880]   Isn't that one of the same? Yeah, well, yeah, exactly. It's just the way you look at it. So
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:50.000]   trigger is the trauma. Yeah, exactly. If you still get triggered by something you still have.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.440]   I mean, yeah, you're not done yet. You're not done yet. You're not done yet. You're not done yet.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:05.360]   Yeah, you're not fully at peace yet. And who can always be fully at peace, right? I mean, you know,
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:12.640]   there's always something that can be happening, right? That throws us out of that inner peace.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:21.600]   I posted an interesting thing on my Instagram the other day. It was on a story, so I can't look up,
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:30.960]   but it literally said be so rude in yourself that, you know, neither the absence nor the presence of
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:37.840]   anyone can disturb your inner peace, right? And it also had a graphic and, you know, showing
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:42.960]   like where that's how that's all related. But in a way, that's kind of what we're working on.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:48.160]   Yeah. And anyone and any anything, of course, should be included.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:54.640]   Okay. Yeah, so just keep working at it. Okay. Number 23, does the service follow the SIM card,
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:00.080]   meaning if I get a new phone, does the service automatically move to the new phone with the card,
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:08.880]   or do we report the change to you? It always stays with the phone that is used that, that carries
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:14.160]   that number, the phone number. If you get a new number, then you actually need to let customer
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:21.120]   service know to, to activate that. But then the other one will be deactivated. Okay. All right,
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:27.600]   there you go. Number 24, I do a type of releasing letting go during the day. David Hawkins, Michael
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:34.320]   Singer type releasing, is it is it also about releasing one's baggage trauma? Does the energy
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:39.600]   from the trauma easy assist with releasing trauma? If we do another release process?
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:47.440]   So how about this combining it with other process? Yes, it should it should definitely help. So
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:54.960]   yeah, if so if you do that anyway, then absolutely go ahead, take your phone, put it on your thymus
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:03.760]   gland, and then then go ahead and do that. Okay. See what it does should be way, way, way, way,
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:11.680]   way quicker. That way. Okay. Number 25, when an inner piece or free tour mine card or frequency
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.320]   enhanced, the letting go. Okay, this is another one of those, would a frequency help in the end?
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:22.400]   You've answered that question. Number 26, how can I see that the trauma easy service has been
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:29.040]   activated? Okay, nothing's on the dashboard or on the phone. So the so your earlier you said,
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:35.600]   it just happens within 15, 30 minutes, and there's no indication, no email, text, anything,
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:41.200]   right? It just happens. That is correct. And at the latest after 30 minutes, it is activated.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:46.960]   Usually it's just 10 to 15 minutes. Oh, okay. Okay. All right. Number 27, can I loan my phone to
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.800]   someone to do the trauma protocol, or does it only work for me?
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:31:01.600]   It's a good question. No, you should be able to lend it to them. Yeah. Okay. That's what I was
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:07.840]   thinking too, just like you can do that with you'll free. Yeah. And if you're a therapist,
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:14.240]   for example, and you have this, then, you know, just you can do it with your patients. That's no
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:21.840]   problem. Awesome. Okay. So number 28, can I now use that phone to help a pet? Oh, we talked about
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:28.640]   pets, most likely not, because they don't do the nine step process. So use the quantum upgrade for
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:35.680]   or put their picture in a block. Okay. Number 29, is it easy to switch from the single to the
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.960]   familial subscription? Do we need to pay the activity? Okay, we, okay, we covered that one.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:46.800]   Yes, it's easy. You just let support know, right? And yeah, you do have to pay the
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.920]   setup fee, because it's a new subscription. Okay, they got that one. Number 30, can you do
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:57.360]   ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, with trauma easy? So if you're not familiar with that,
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:02.640]   that's a Hawaiian trauma release protocol. So I think we answered that, right? You can use trauma
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:10.160]   easy with other protocols, and most likely it'll benefit, correct? Yes. All right. 31,
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.800]   if placing the phone on my chest doesn't feel right, can I just have it nearby,
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:21.280]   when doing the steps, where it generally feels very good? Or does it have to be on the thomas?
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:28.400]   No, it should definitely be there. Yeah. Okay, so it's very important that you put it.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:35.360]   Because that's like right above your, what is it, heart chakra, right? Because your thomas,
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:43.360]   is it a chakra, or is it above the chakra? No, it's above the chakra, actually. And there's a
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:50.560]   really good picture on all our website, actually on the traumese page. There's a really nice picture
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:55.680]   that shows you exactly where it is. I think, yeah, it's actually on that. Yeah, exactly,
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:02.480]   right there. Okay, because this is like, this is a really important part of your energetic body,
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.680]   it has to be there, right, for this thing to work. It was designed to work there.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:15.040]   So the answer is no, you need to put it where it needs to be. Okay, now here's the one 32. How
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:20.240]   long does it take for the traumese now, if you wanted to use your phone with traumese to charge
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:26.720]   of water or food? I believe you answered this. I thought, I think you said two to four minutes.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:32.080]   I think in the first, right, yeah, I remember you answered this one. So it's two to four minutes,
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:36.080]   and you have to place the phone next to the thing you want to charge, right?
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:45.360]   Correct. Next to or if you have, let's say you have a bag of apples or whatever, just put it on top.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:50.640]   Okay, so it needs to be underneath. Okay, next to the food, two to four minutes,
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:57.360]   and that will charge food and drink. Number 33, will traumese overcharge the area we usually
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:06.240]   place our phone? There's no overcharging, right? No. Okay, so it doesn't do that like some of the
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:15.280]   blocks do. Okay. So no worries. By the way, so I got an answer in regards to the audio. So by the
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:21.600]   end of this week, it will be up and running again. Okay. Are you going to put the link on the website
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:30.640]   or put it into the PDF? I honestly don't know. I think it will definitely be someone that traumese
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:36.080]   section. Okay. So let me see if I can get an answer here before we're done. Are you going to
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:43.440]   update the audio to? Because I haven't or because I know you needed to update the PDF. So does that
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:48.080]   mean, you know, for this one paragraph right here? Yes. Does that mean you're going to update the
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:53.360]   audio as well? So everybody should go back and get the newest copy. Okay, so what we'll do is as
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:59.680]   soon as the updated ones are out, Phillip or I or both of us will make an announcement and
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:06.400]   telegram to go down and get the newest copy. Sound good? That way everybody's got the right version
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:14.000]   of the audio. Okay. All right. Cool. Now where was I? Let's see. Okay. Okay. So number 34 with some
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.360]   subjects, I just keep getting distracted instead of being able to go deeper, which I suspect is a
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:24.800]   protection mechanism. I've learned a very, very astute. Do I just let these subjects be for now
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:34.560]   or do I continue to try? That's a good point because it can indeed happen. And usually I would say
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:39.360]   at first, if you feel like, Oh, my God, I'm just getting too tired. I can't deal with it now.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:48.160]   Give yourself some time and then give it a few days and then go at it again until you really
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:53.840]   make that decision. Okay. Now I'll go through or not feel I can go through it, then go ahead and
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:36:01.200]   do it. So it really depends on you. You can do it either way. Okay. Yeah. That's an actually,
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.760]   that's a really good question. So I have that same issue when I try to meditate, I can't get my head,
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:12.800]   my inner voice to just shut up. You know, I have a real hard time with it. I'm always going off on
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:18.240]   tangents. Well, it can also be a voice of, Oh, yeah, I mean, it's not going to do anything anyway. You
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:26.480]   know, I just can't, you know, I'm just not gonna bother. But that's, yeah, that's then the ego playing
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:33.120]   a role and saying to ourselves, you know, just just keep me, just keep the trauma.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:39.840]   It says other words for saying keep the trauma. Yeah. Well, it's like, it's like an old back injury,
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:45.040]   you know, like one thing I've got a really old back injuries for when I was a teenager. And one
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:50.400]   thing I've learned over time is that, you know, where you've got deficiencies in your skeletal
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:58.240]   system, your muscles will compensate. And so they'll stiffen up and hold you in place. So you kind
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:04.160]   of like, so because how I found this out is, you know, I went to a massage person who said, Oh,
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.400]   you're really stiff here and here, let me get rid of that for you. And I was thinking, you know,
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.800]   I was thinking at the moment, it's just kind of like, well, you know, is that a good thing, you
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:18.960]   know, and then they released all that tension. I was in a, I was in a back brace for three weeks,
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:23.840]   because my body had learned to live with that, with my muscles holding me together. In other
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:29.760]   words, I had learned to exist with the trauma as part of my being. And then you took that trauma
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:34.880]   away and it just blew me it just like knocked me to my feet, you know, my knees. I think that's
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:39.920]   emotionally probably the same thing when you agree, that sometimes our trauma has become part of our
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:44.240]   support process of our, of our emotional wellbeing. And you take it away, it's like you're kind of
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:50.400]   it. You know, you exactly, but that's, that's exactly the way the why we have all these steps
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:56.240]   also towards the hands, you know, to really go through that. And because you actually then fill
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:02.880]   up this empty space, if you will. And that's quite an important piece and part of it, because then
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:09.360]   you can actually, when you're done with the session, you will feel full rather than empty.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.920]   Right, so you put something to replace it, something positive instead of the negative that was there.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:20.640]   Keep yourself whole. That makes sense. Okay, good point. All right, number 35, I have an EM. Okay,
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.360]   this is when EMF protection case on the phone. Do we need to remove it? The answer is yes.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:31.440]   Just use your phone. And that goes along with, do I need to leave my phone on airplane mode?
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.120]   Turn it off, leave it on. You know, it doesn't matter, right?
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.840]   That all doesn't matter. And okay, yeah, that all doesn't matter.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.280]   Yeah, because well, some people were, there's a couple of comments about people were worried
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:48.480]   about the EMF, you know, the pulse that comes to the phone, and they didn't want to put it on
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:54.720]   their body, right? Because of the EMF issue, but trauma easy mitigates the EMF. So even if you're
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:59.520]   gone, and you put it on your thalamus, you're, it's going to be okay, right? That's what I was
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:06.880]   thinking. Yeah, it's actually beneficial. So get it out of your head, people that, you know, because
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:14.560]   if it's if it's harmonized this way with the traumese, the harmonizer, then it's, it's beneficial
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:20.800]   if you put it there. Okay, no, that's great. Okay, number 37, instead of picking up a specific trauma
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:26.880]   to release, are we able to tap into a feeling, emotion, sensation in the body, and release what
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:33.120]   or whatever it is tied to that without knowing why it's there. So in other words, you're not,
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:39.120]   you're not able to name the trauma, but you have the, like the whispers or the, you know, you can
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:43.760]   feel something was there, but you don't know what that trauma, what, you know, where it came from.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:51.040]   Do you just get rid of that emotion? Instead of... I would, I would still work on the trauma,
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:58.000]   but it's the same as before when you're working with an unconscious trauma, I just should describe
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:05.040]   it. You use the description. Okay. You know, just, you know, I don't know. So you know, the trauma behind
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:12.240]   the wizard or whatever it may be, like you could describe it, if you were to a friend, what's always
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:20.000]   happening to you, just description, you know, obviously don't, don't use like photographs,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.240]   but if you put it all in one sentence, one crisp description, that should be enough.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:32.240]   Okay. All right. So yeah, so use, use those feelings, emotions and sensations.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:39.200]   And to explain why that is, to explain why that is, because trauma is a bundle of energy.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:45.200]   And, and also here need basically, we need to identify it. We need to name it. There needs
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:51.600]   to be your signal, which trauma is about. So that's, if we describe it, then we have named
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:58.400]   that it is clear what it is that we're talking about. Okay. So in this example, I just want to be
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:03.280]   real clear, right? Because in this example, you get in the person, it's an example of getting an
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:10.720]   intense feeling of fear from nowhere, and not knowing where it comes from. So the trauma itself
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:16.960]   is then the fear. So then you would use the fear, you would rank it zero to 10, and work on releasing
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:22.880]   the fear and not worry about where it comes from. But the fear itself is the trauma. Would that be
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:30.160]   about right? I would not say that the fear is the trauma. The fear is the symptoms of what
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:41.840]   I decided. And I would then say, okay, so I'm now working on the trauma that lets me be in this
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:49.360]   severe state of fear in these situations. That's how I would name it, basically describe it.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:58.400]   Then you'll basically find what is related here, always. And the fairness of that, you know,
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:08.880]   then go dial in the process. But if the fear is the fear is the symptom. And then also,
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:12.960]   while you're working on the trauma, you know, you're not in this.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:25.520]   Hello? Oh, I just lost Phillip. Hold on, everybody. I think he's dialing back in.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.640]   Okay, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you now. We just lost you for a few seconds.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.400]   Oh, strange. Okay, but I hope that was still clear.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:44.480]   What I said. Okay, yeah, I was cut off. No, no, you were cut off right at the tail end,
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:50.480]   but I think to paraphrase it, though, like my interpretation was not as clear as yours.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:55.600]   In other words, if you're feeling fear, but you don't know where it comes from, that where it
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:01.040]   comes from is the trauma, not the fear, fear is not the trauma. Fear is a description of the trauma,
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:07.040]   but right, you can use that description to describe it in the process, right? And you just kind of
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:14.000]   go through those same nine steps and using fear as a descriptor of the trauma. You don't have to,
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.840]   you don't have to know where it comes from. Okay, all right. It's like that whole ancestral
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.800]   soul trauma, like, you know, it's like, you don't know what happened in the past when you weren't
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:28.240]   around, you know, the same person right now, but you can still have the remnants of it, right?
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:34.560]   And then you can work on that. Okay, number 38, can we tap into that feeling and release the trauma
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:40.080]   attached to it without having contact? Same question. Yeah, and the answer is yes. Use those
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:48.080]   feelings as a descriptors as you're working through each trauma. Okay, now number 39, does the trauma
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:54.480]   easy service automatically transfer to a new device when we upgrade from one phone to another?
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:59.840]   I'm currently using a iPhone 12, but we're getting a 15. So I get, oh, yeah. So the answer is I'm
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:07.120]   keeping the same phone number, just changing the device. So your prior answer was wherever the phone
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:13.280]   rings with that phone number, it's that's the phone. Correct. Energy goes to that one. And the only
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:18.400]   time you can get rid of energy is to cancel the service, right? It's it's permanently, it's not
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:24.640]   being transmitted all the time. It's just like, like QU is always just constantly turned on unless
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:30.800]   I turn it off. But trauma easy is where you basically send energy to that phone and the phone holds
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:38.720]   onto the energy. It's not streaming. Is it streaming? Well, no, it doesn't work through the quantum
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:45.440]   upgrade system, but it's a it's a similar process, though. Okay. And it's always with this energy.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:53.440]   Yeah, it's always as long as it's activated and not canceled, it transmits that energy.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:59.200]   Okay, we'll call up. We'll have a new phrase out there for you. You can call it quantum streaming.
[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:07.120]   You should trademark that. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Well, you know what, that was all the
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:12.480]   question. I think we got one more question right at the last minute. Let me see if I can find it.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:21.840]   Okay, here's if I get trauma easy on my phone, would my quantum block be damaged, upgraded by
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:30.640]   having the phone in it while trauma easy is activated? There's one last question. It's hard to tell.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:36.160]   I would definitely not do that. Like, I mean, to be honest, like, why would you even do that and
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:41.600]   put your phone with a trauma easy in the quantum block? There's neither a benefit you can gain
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:49.920]   to your phone. And you're possibly transmitting something to the quantum block that the quantum
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:57.040]   block doesn't need. So I would just straight off say, just don't do that. Okay, I tested it, but I
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.520]   would really not do that. So I think, yeah, I think that goes to the, you know, before the
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:06.800]   trauma easy existed, right? We were telling people, yeah, you can go ahead and charge your
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:11.680]   electronics using any of the blocks, right? And just instructions there where any of your
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:18.160]   electronics, just put it in there for x number of minutes per the guide, you know, a couple of times
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:24.080]   a year, and then now charge your phone. But if now that if you've quote got trauma easy,
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.360]   don't put it in the block because it's quote charged. That'd be the best way.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:32.320]   Exactly. You don't you don't need anything. Okay, all right, there you go.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:38.800]   Okay, so that was quick. We got through that. We surprised we got through 39 questions as fast
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.200]   as we did. So thank you so much for your time, Phillip. I know you're super busy.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:49.280]   And so if you get anybody wants to reach out, ask more questions, obviously go to either one of
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.360]   the two telegram chat groups. There were questions about whether or not we're going to set up a
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:58.400]   third one just for trauma easy. Phillip, what are your thoughts on that? Are we just going to keep
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:04.480]   the two telegram groups and not have a third one? Yeah, I think so. Okay, so we'll just keep
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:09.280]   what do you think? What do you think? I think there's so much confusion as to where people
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:14.240]   should post their questions now. I think having a third one would just make it worse, right? Because
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:19.360]   there's okay, you've always got posting questions in the other group, right? And they're constantly
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:24.560]   being referred to the other group, because that's where all the answers are. You know, and so that's
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:28.800]   bad enough as it is today, I think a third one would just make it even worse. And for those of
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.840]   you guys out there in Internet world, I don't know if you realize, but there's like one or two
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:40.080]   moderators. You know, Phillip's always, you know, if you follow Phillip, he's flying around constantly
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:45.920]   going and doing all of these shows and interviews and he works and he's the main guy doing all the
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.080]   copying. And yeah, so Phillip, you know, even though he's a moderator, he's not in there much, but
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:54.080]   so it's usually Emma and I and then Anna joins every now and then. But yeah, there's not a lot of
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:59.760]   moderators. So definitely don't want a third group to have to moderate. Okay, so there's that.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:04.160]   But anyway, so anyway, if you go on, if you, but you have questions, as you just noticed, I'm
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:09.440]   tracking all the questions, making sure they get answered so you can find us and find Phillip
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:14.720]   at Leila quantum tech or quantum upgrade or the two telegram channels for those two. And if you're
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:19.120]   interested in what I'm doing, I kind of, I'm the super user, have a whole section of my blog on
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:24.320]   the Tinkers Academy, dedicated to Leila and all the stuff for Leila and all the tinkering I've
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.320]   done and you name it. So you can find a bunch of information there too, if you're into quantum
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:33.200]   and of course, telegram. So that's how you reach us. So any last thoughts or anything coming up that
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.600]   you want to let people know about? You mentioned Las Vegas is coming up. So did you want to like
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:42.720]   plug that and let people know that's coming up? Today's October. Yeah, so there's a big big
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:48.800]   conference in Las Vegas three days. It's on the 10th, 11th and 12th of November. It's called the
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:56.960]   Stairway to the Stars. It's organized by disclosure fest. The guy that has founded that his name is
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:05.680]   Adrian super nice guy. They run the largest mass meditation events in LA once a year and they feed
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:15.200]   literally tens of thousands of homeless people. It's a nonprofit organization. They plant trees,
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:22.640]   they just do a lot of great work. And so they're having this conference. There's a lot of stuff
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:29.200]   that I'm usually not really into. So I think they're having even some
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:36.560]   talks there in regards to UFOs and stuff like that. That's usually a topic I'm not so
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:44.400]   into, but why not? And it also talks about health, human health, biohacking and all of that
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:51.840]   in a really holistic way. And I think that's why we're there. It'll be great. And then a few
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:58.400]   days later, there's going to be the Dragonfly conference in Boulder, Colorado. So I think that's
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:04.640]   on the 18th and 19th, if I'm not mistaken, or 17th and 18th, something like that, you can look it up
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:10.000]   Dragonfly conference. It's a biohacking for women conference, the largest in the US.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:18.640]   And you will see a lot of men there as well, including Dave Asprey, I'm Mitchell, many others,
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:25.760]   and myself. All right. Awesome. But before we partway is, I want to say one more thing,
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:33.680]   and that is a huge thank you to UK, because that you're doing these educational videos and
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:39.440]   interviews. And I mean, you put all the work here in this, I mean, just writing down all these
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:45.360]   questions, extracting it, putting it on slides, and then doing the actual interview. So a huge
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:53.840]   thanks. And yeah, really, really appreciate that. And I'm sure that every single member in the group
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:51:00.640]   also appreciates that a lot. Hey, thanks. Yeah, it's my thing. Just really into this.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.080]   You know, it's really, it's really starting to take off, Philip. I don't know if you know it is,
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:12.400]   right? But this week, both Luke Story and Dave Asprey put out videos, Dave Asprey put out a
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:19.600]   video interviewing somebody about quantum DNA, right, ancestry. And then Luke Story put out
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:25.920]   interview, he interviewed somebody and the topic of his interview was quantum,
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:33.520]   was it quantum biology, right? And it's just amazing how, you know, it's just, it's really,
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:39.200]   people are starting to really understand what quantum is, and and how it affects,
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:44.960]   you know, our biology and how it affects, you know, everything, just the communication,
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:50.400]   you know, of information throughout the university. It's pretty cool. You know, it's just, you know,
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:56.480]   it's like three years ago, when you started, you know, people were just quantum was like a buzzword
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:02.400]   for, you know, like basically if you Google the word quantum, all sorts of stuff pops up like golf
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:07.760]   clubs and there's, I think there's even a motorized wheelchair called the quantum, you know, and you
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:13.280]   just get all this stuff, right? But it wasn't actually like about quantum. So yeah, it's kind of cool.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:18.560]   I'm just really into it. And yeah, it's been fun. It's been, it's been a fun ride. So yeah, thanks
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:22.800]   anyway. I do. I really enjoy doing this kind of stuff. All right. So hey, guys, everybody,
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:27.440]   thank you very much, Philip, for your time answering the questions. Again, if you want to reach out,
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.600]   you know where to find us. And Philip, any last words?
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:35.840]   Thank you so much, everyone out there. You are all pioneers, actually, in this space. And
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:43.680]   yeah, it's that's the way to do it. It's so much fun. Also meeting, you know, anyone that comes to
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:47.840]   these conferences sometime meeting the person or sometimes we have also people coming to our
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:53.280]   reach kids in Costa Rica. And you know, it's always fun to connect on Telegram. And then
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:58.240]   if you meet someone in real life that, oh, hey, you know, I've been in the Telegram group for so long,
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:04.720]   it's always so much fun. I really love this community and all of you out there. And
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:12.800]   yeah, it's just, it's just great. And it's, it's quite amazing what has happened. What Kate just
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:19.120]   said is indeed true. And you'll see that in the next five years, things will continue to evolve
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:24.880]   and shift quite a bit because that's the time, you know, this this stuff, the frequency, medicine,
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:31.840]   and quantum energy, all of that will be way more known in the next five years. And
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:39.120]   lots of fun stuff will will be possible. And yeah, you already know all of that today.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:44.800]   Cool. All right. Well, thanks a lot. And everybody, don't forget, if you're anywhere near Vegas or
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:49.840]   Boulder, Colorado, in the next month, you can stop by and see Phillip. So all right, then
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:54.560]   have a great day, everybody. Aloha. Thanks, Phillip. All right. Thank you.
