[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.760]   Hello everyone and welcome to another carbon 60 video
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.320]   by me, Kay Elmer.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.120]   And in this video, I'd like to share with you
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.440]   what I have learned about using C60 topically.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.160]   Now, obviously, before we jump into that,
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.360]   I've got some disclaimers that this material
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.080]   is for research purposes only.
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.320]   C60 and C60 oil is not approved for consumption by the FDA.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.920]   This is not medical or health advice.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.440]   It's not a product endorsement.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.280]   I do not sell any C60 products and I do not get paid
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.760]   in any way to do these videos.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.480]   I'm just sharing what I learn with anyone who wants to learn it.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.600]   So here we go, jump right in.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.880]   First thing I learned was there's a lot of benefits,
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.720]   not a lot like dozens and dozens,
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.280]   but some considerable interesting scientific research
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.160]   has been done both in private and in academia
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.440]   with regards to what is it, what happens when you put C60
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.520]   on top of the skin and in the hair and scalp and so forth.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.680]   And so looking at one company,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.880]   it's a Japanese company called
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.320]   Vitamin C60 by Research Corporation.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.680]   They basically have come out
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.080]   and all the links in the video description,
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.360]   you can go learn up on their website
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.080]   about their research or the research that they've gathered,
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.360]   but they have discovered
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.200]   and they actually are producing products.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.600]   Now, what's interesting about this Japanese company
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.240]   is they go back to 2005.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.280]   They predate, way predate the 2012 rat study
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.640]   that got everybody to start drinking C60 in oil.
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.360]   These guys have been putting in cosmetics
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.040]   for over a decade, so that's fascinating.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.160]   And so they have done a lot of research
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.200]   and they've discovered that there are some real strong benefits
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.560]   about using C60 topically for acne treatment,
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.400]   for aging, inflammatory wrinkles, moisturizing,
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.280]   poor tightening, hair growth, scalp treatment
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.800]   and whitening melanin control.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.240]   Now, whitening is one thing,
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.240]   but melanin control also ties towards melanomas
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.280]   and anti-cancer as well.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.200]   So that's real interesting.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.920]   So a lot of really good interesting things
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.640]   and benefits that they've discovered
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.840]   in the Japanese company.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.120]   It also, the video description,
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.480]   if you wanna take a look at it,
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.320]   is a really good article by Dr. Leslie Bauman
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.680]   in Dermatology News where she actually walks through
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.960]   these various properties of fullerenes.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.120]   And I'm using that word fullerenes
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.160]   and synonymous with C60 for this video.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.960]   And so fullerenes in cosmetics
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.080]   where she also talks about the acne,
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.920]   sorry, anti-acne properties, anti-viral,
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.780]   anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial,
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.680]   the hair regrowth and the antioxidant
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.480]   and how safe it is that it's not toxic
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.400]   to human beings and so, or any mammal actually.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.240]   And so there's a lot,
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.040]   I mean, you can just see right here on this one slide
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.680]   that there's a lot of benefits for any of you guys
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.600]   who haven't yet considered using C60 on your skin.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.840]   'Cause a lot of us just kind of focus on using C60
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.340]   as a supplement that you take in orally.
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.240]   But I was really surprised
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.440]   that this goes back so much farther
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.600]   and it's so much more out there
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.760]   than everybody else who's just taking it.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.640]   So a lot of really good benefits.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.120]   Take a look at the video link description, read up on it.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.440]   And I wanna point out, share with you
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.440]   some of those, some of the detail,
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.400]   just I just grabbed like the top three or four
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.840]   to share with you so you can kind of see
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.680]   what the research shows.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.480]   So here's one science study
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.880]   called the clinical evaluation of fullerenes C60
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.680]   dissolved in squalene for anti-wrinkle cosmetics.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.680]   So when using C60 for anti-wrinkle, okay,
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.080]   the one experiment here discusses
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.760]   that there is a squalene prepared from olive oil,
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.440]   dissolved the C60 in it.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.360]   23 Japanese women, average age was 38.9
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.880]   over an eight week trial.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.280]   Okay, now these ladies applied the C60 solution
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.880]   on half of their face and then left just oil
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.720]   on the other half.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.080]   So C60 with oil on one half, just oil on the other half.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.800]   And after eight weeks, the science study just determined
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.400]   that there was significantly that side with the LF,
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   which is the lipofluorine SQ squalene.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.440]   I got a funny way of saying C60 oil.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.080]   LF says Q cream, that was applied on the face twice daily
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.720]   was significantly more effective than the placebo,
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.800]   which is just the oil eighth week
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.440]   without any severe side effects.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.200]   So it definitely made a difference on wrinkles.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.280]   Whoa, surprising, interesting, let's move on.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.920]   Here's one on acne where the study was called
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.560]   the improvement of acne vulgaris
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.760]   by topical fullerene application
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.440]   and its unique impact on skincare.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.060]   So the method of the study was it was an open trial
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.060]   using fullerene gel twice a day at four and at eight weeks.
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.480]   They reviewed it and they discovered,
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.260]   and this is amazing to me, this number here,
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.680]   which is the number of pustules of the acne, okay,
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.840]   reduced 87.6%.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.300]   That's in two months, they were able to,
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.380]   by using just C60 gel, they were able to almost
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.680]   practically eliminate the acne, I mean, at 87.6.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.160]   And then they basically put in their abstract
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.720]   that the fullerene gel may help in controlling acne
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.000]   with skincare benefit.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.800]   I mean, may, I don't even know why they use the word may,
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.820]   they're probably just being safe,
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.160]   but I'm telling you that 87.6 is damn high number.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   So that's amazing effect of C60 on acne.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160]   Now let's take a look at C60 on hair growth.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.680]   Now this is, the prior two were research studies
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.600]   produced by academia, and now this is a research study
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.080]   produced by the private sector from this vitamin C60
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.440]   by our research corporation.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.760]   And from this point in the video,
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.560]   I'll just call them quote the Japanese company.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.960]   It's a lot easier to say.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.200]   So anyway, so their study on hair growth,
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.680]   they took 16 men, they have their own product
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.780]   that they've trademarked called radical sponge,
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.340]   and radical obviously meaning that it's a radical
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.780]   oxygen species scavenger, and it sucks it up, right?
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.220]   So they're used in cute little marketing phrase here.
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.260]   16 guys twice a day for six months,
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.380]   they, you know, for hair growth.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.580]   And after six months, this is what's really cool,
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.140]   hair growth rate became 16% faster after the six months.
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.660]   So definitely improved their hair growth.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.580]   And what was interesting about this
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.660]   was I was working on this video right at the same time
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.980]   that if you know who Ian Mitchell is with the live pet,
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.060]   the C60 pet product, he also is the vice president
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.460]   of research and operations for carbon 60 plus,
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.060]   the company for humans, and they produce a C60 oil.
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.500]   Anyway, so carbon 60 plus put out a new product line
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.020]   about two weeks ago, right when I started working
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.500]   on this video, and the new product line is called
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.100]   health through C360, and they've got three separate products,
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.140]   and one of those products happens to be hair growth.
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.780]   So here I am studying hair growth,
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.460]   and then boom, this product comes out.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.140]   I don't have any issues with hair growth,
[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.860]   but for those of you who do, you might wanna check this out.
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.020]   It's pretty cool.
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.700]   The website basically says that the active ingredient
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.340]   that what they have discovered was that in their own
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.340]   clinical trials is that they created a C60 product.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.340]   It's not just pure C60 and any one particular oil
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.740]   it's a blend of oils, and that their product reactivates
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.980]   hair follicles that have been installed
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.260]   due to hereditary hair loss, physical conditions,
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.340]   or environmental factors, and they are letting you know
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.020]   that their trials have indicated that you will see results
[00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.980]   using the C360 hair growth product within three to six weeks
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.020]   and here's a picture right off their website,
[00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.700]   and so you can see this huge patch
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.980]   and really filling in at 150 days,
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.060]   and so that's at carbon 60 plus, so if you wanna try out
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.500]   C60 on hair growth, clearly there's now an opportunity
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.860]   to do so, so this is amazing, and in both basically
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.140]   a Japanese company and the American company both came up
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.300]   with the same results using fullerenes for hair growth,
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.300]   and that's just another amazing effect of C60 topically.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.780]   So now let's talk about the different ways
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.460]   you can use C60 topically, obviously.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.420]   Number one is cosmetics, which we've been discussing,
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.260]   and skin treatment, acne, wrinkles, cosmetics,
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.300]   et cetera, so here's just a list of various different types
[00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.140]   of products that the Japanese company actually makes,
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.380]   they make the actual products that sell to a cosmetic company
[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.460]   so they're completely wholesale industry supplier,
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.420]   and so this is what they provide,
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.620]   is they basically provide fullerenes in skincare products,
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.260]   lotions and serums and creams, and then of course,
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.020]   people have been taking those products,
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.660]   they're fullerene products and putting them in cosmetics,
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.100]   hair care, beauty laser care, sunscreen, facial masks,
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:54.020]   and so on and so on, so you can see that you can find C60
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.540]   in a wide variety of cosmetics,
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.460]   and what's really interesting about this Japanese company
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.540]   is that they've been around since 2005
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.260]   and doing research studies on this stuff,
[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.500]   and so they really predate the rat study,
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.460]   so they've been really doing this stuff
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.180]   for a much longer time than anyone else has
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.700]   in the area of the folks that are making C60 oil to ingest,
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.340]   so what I was surprised to find out was that
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.420]   there's been more activity and for longer
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.300]   about putting C60 on your skin
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.780]   than there's ever been about studies
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.420]   and science and products about ingesting C60,
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.220]   so if anyone is ever worried about ingesting C60,
[00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.300]   go ahead and try it on your skin
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.580]   because there's a lot more research and data on that,
[00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.740]   it goes back to 2005 as opposed to 2012, right?
[00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.220]   So it's pretty amazing,
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.140]   so if you wanna try C60 on your skin,
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.940]   there's a ton of products out there
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.460]   that already have it in it,
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.460]   it's well-established, a lot of good science,
[00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.020]   and there you go.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.260]   Now there's a second way of putting C60 on your skin,
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.980]   and that is an absolute no-brainer for all you guys
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.820]   who've been taking C60 orally,
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.900]   and that's just use what you've been taking orally
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.940]   by whatever product you own,
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.620]   or if you make it at home,
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.420]   try it on your skin,
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.820]   and so as I've been reading up
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.940]   on all the different testimonials
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.620]   and the different things that people have been reporting
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.340]   by just taking the stuff you take in your mouth,
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.420]   put it on your skin,
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.260]   I've read the one person put it in their eyes,
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.420]   which I don't recommend at all,
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.340]   that just kinda weirds me out,
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.500]   but they said that it helped with their cataracts.
[00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.180]   Exima, insect bites, numbness,
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.060]   rashes, sore joints, sore muscles,
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.820]   sunburn and wound healing,
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.220]   and so right here I can give you a testimony about Exima,
[00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.460]   I have Exima, and when I have a breakout
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.140]   where my skin starts peeling away and it's itchy and all that,
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.420]   I've been putting C60 oil on my skin,
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.540]   and that, it works so much better
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.940]   than the steroidal cream
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.060]   that my doctor prescribes for me,
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.500]   and so I've pretty much given up on the medicines
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.980]   that people prescribe for my Exima,
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.420]   and I just put the C60 oil on like three, four, five times a day,
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.940]   whenever it even starts to get itchy,
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.020]   I'll put it on there,
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.020]   and it not only does, because it's in oil,
[00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.820]   you know, it keeps my skin moist
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.780]   and it actually just stops the itching
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.660]   and it heals faster, it's healing a lot faster,
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.020]   so I'm telling you, it's pretty amazing
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.020]   that not only can you ingest this stuff,
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.020]   you can put it on your skin
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.820]   and it also gives you some really great results,
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.140]   so something to think about for you guys
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.820]   who have not tried it yet on your skin.
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.220]   Now of course, so what are the best oils
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:23.060]   for what type of skin type?
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.220]   There's actually a difference,
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.980]   so I did a little research on that,
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.020]   because based on the type of skin you have,
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.020]   you might wanna have a oil that's designed for that
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.900]   or best for that, so here's just a little handy guide
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.660]   that I pulled off the internet, basically saying,
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.140]   hey, if you have oily skin, these are the best oils,
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.580]   so now as in relationship to C60,
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.940]   you can buy a C60 flaxseed oil,
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.460]   there's a brand new company that just popped up
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.900]   that's selling C60 in flaxseed oil,
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.020]   of course there's my last pricing guide,
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.620]   I showed you different vendors
[00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.460]   that are selling it out in hemp oil,
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.780]   so for oily skin, C60 flaxseed or C60 hemp.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.740]   Then of course, if you have normal and mixed skin,
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:00.940]   there's sunflower oil,
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.660]   and if you have dry skin, there's C60 olive oil,
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.820]   I'm sorry, olive oil right here,
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.540]   avocado oil and coconut oil,
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.780]   so there's already on the market C60 oil products
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.620]   that you could buy based on what type of skin you have there,
[00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.420]   but of course, me, I always advocate to make it yourself,
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.980]   but keep in mind what's the best oil for your skin type
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.340]   and give it a try for the next time
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.700]   you have insect bites, rashes, whatever, it does work.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.980]   In fact, this might actually really, really explain
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.660]   what happened when a friend of mine fell in some poison oak,
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.980]   and because it was all on the outside of him
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.540]   and it just prevented him from even getting the rash,
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.060]   it's amazing, it's amazing stuff.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.660]   So there you go on how to use C60 topically using C60 oil.
[00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.900]   Now what I'd like to share with everyone too
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:52.340]   is an experiment which is a third way of taking,
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:56.380]   or using C60 topically that no one has ever done before,
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.860]   and that is actually applying the raw C60
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.700]   in a pulverized slash monomolecular form
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.860]   right onto your skin.
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.860]   And so the question that this answered for me,
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.180]   which was the research question was,
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.220]   can you take C60 without oil and it's a resounding yes?
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.140]   And of course, if you know the story behind this,
[00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.100]   and if you watch my pulverized C60 video,
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.220]   I had a lab accident where I spilled a whole bunch
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.540]   of this pulverized C60 on my hands and discovered,
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.100]   yes, you can get a massive dose of C60
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.260]   in a pulverized form because the particulate size
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.300]   is so small, it seeps right into your skin,
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.620]   right into your capillades, right into your bloodstream,
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.460]   and you get a dose of it through your skin really easily.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.940]   And I discovered that in a lab accident,
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.380]   and then now what I've done is I've replicated that
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:47.700]   as an experiment to see what it would be like
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.740]   to take C60 regularly through the skin.
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.820]   And I mean by a pulverized C60, so courtesy of Redline,
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.820]   thank you very much for producing this product.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.780]   However, I would like to give a disclaimer
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.860]   in Redline's favor that Redline Biomedical Labs
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.500]   does not endorse the topical application
[00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.980]   of pulverized C60 and advises against it.
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.820]   If you go to their website, they will tell you,
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.100]   do not do this.
[00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.700]   And so of course, two nut jobs here decided to do it.
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.540]   So the experiment that I wanna share with you
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.500]   is the third way to apply and use C60 topically.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.020]   So this experiment involved two nut jobs
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.780]   at the average age of 57 and a half years old.
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.220]   Over six weeks, each one of us had a two gram bottle
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.700]   of pulverized C60 and we took one dose a day.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.140]   The way that we applied, I'm sorry, jumped ahead.
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.380]   Now the dosing process or that we came up with
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.820]   was we decided, okay, well, why don't we take
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.020]   an amount of C60 pulverized, raw C60,
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.860]   that would be equivalent to taking a teaspoon of oil.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.140]   So here's some quick math and what it really comes out to
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:55.140]   is that one tablespoon of oil equals 0.12 milliliters
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:58.220]   of pulverized C60 in solution.
[00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.780]   And what I mean by that is pulverized C60 comes
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.140]   in a bottle floating in alcohol.
[00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.460]   Okay, so it's so fine.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.900]   It's like finer than soot.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.540]   And so they mix it up with alcohol so that you can,
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.860]   you can use it, otherwise it would be really hard
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.180]   to even mess with it.
[00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.300]   So this is like a two gram bottle.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.540]   And for every one gram of pulverized C60,
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.660]   there's 10 milliliters of pure alcohol in this jar.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.780]   Okay, so what you have to do is basically do the translation
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.060]   of it's not an oil, it's an alcohol.
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.220]   So for one tablespoon of oil, the amount of C60
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.500]   equals 0.12 milliliters, okay, of pulverized.
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.580]   So that's what we did.
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.940]   Now this is, I'll just name him Jay.
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.220]   I'm okay, he went before me about four weeks
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.860]   'cause it's always good to let someone go first.
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.980]   And so he decided to go ahead and start trying
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:46.940]   and I'm like, yeah, go for it.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.780]   I'm gonna know what happens.
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.860]   And he didn't die, so then I said, okay, I'll try to.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.900]   And so the other nut job tried it first.
[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.900]   And in the morning, this is, he used the crook of his arm.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.140]   That's what he decided to try to do.
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:56.980]   This is his arm.
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.100]   And then by evening, it would just completely disappear.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.420]   Now what it would do is it smudge out as, you know,
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.020]   he closed your arm, but it basically smudged out
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.980]   and completely absorbed into his skin.
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.300]   Of course, there was some that did rub off on his shirt,
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.480]   but the majority got absorbed according to Jay.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.740]   Now the two of us both kind of, you know,
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.780]   must, I guess we kind of messed with the best way
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.860]   to apply it 'cause no one had ever done this before.
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.380]   We're the first ones that ever tried this.
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:20.980]   So we didn't really know the best way to do this.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.260]   And so we kind of made it up as we went.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.580]   And so what we discovered was that the application
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.820]   of the Poplar C60 on the skin, that syringe's work best.
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.860]   Now, and what eventually this is Jay,
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.180]   he first started with this little weird, I don't know,
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.500]   fingernail, do-hickey thing.
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.620]   And he tried that, it didn't work.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.180]   And then he switched to using the one milliliter syringe
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.220]   that comes with the jar.
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.640]   And in using that, he said it worked really well.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.500]   And he basically said one milliliter syringe.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.060]   And his dosage was two drops.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.420]   Now what I did was I started with using the syringe
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.060]   with this, I have three milliliter syringes
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.340]   with a two and a half inch or two inch blunt nose needle.
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.860]   And what I use that for is I use that as my extractor
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.660]   of Poplar C60 and when I want to push it into
[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.500]   or put it into olive oil or whatever oil.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.260]   And so that's kind of how I extract it and move it around.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.180]   And so this is what I started to use,
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.820]   but because I discovered right off in the first few days
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.820]   that a 13 gauge needle puts out way too much Poplar C60
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.340]   and I just end up splishing too much
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.420]   on the, I was using the back of my hand
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.740]   and it just kept coming out way too much.
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.900]   And it was just making a huge mess.
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.380]   So I went and bought much smaller needles.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.940]   I got a 30 gauge needle.
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.540]   And when I put that on, it just worked splendidly.
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.660]   I can control the actual drop so I can actually count
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.700]   the drops out one at a time as I put it on my skin.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.660]   So keep in mind that if you're using needles
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.020]   or even using this little syringe
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.500]   or this little open area,
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.580]   that the tip dries out.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.300]   And so when you go to depress it the next day,
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.540]   you have to kind of give it a real strong push
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.180]   to kind of push the plug out at the end of the nipple.
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.180]   Sorry, needle.
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:01.060]   And then the Poplar C60 comes out.
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.900]   So you can imagine that if you have a really big opening
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.660]   that you're gonna goosh out a bunch
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.700]   and you're gonna get way more than you intended.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.980]   So over time, it took several weeks before J got good at it
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.700]   where he could just control the amount he was dosing.
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.980]   And I got good at it when I finally got these needles.
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.700]   So there you go, we learned something.
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.540]   We're sharing it with you.
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.820]   Save yourself a bunch of trouble.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.300]   And then last thing too is that when you do put it
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.260]   on your skin, you know, even though this is what it looked
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.900]   like right when he had done it, he spreads it out.
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.540]   And it's really important to spread it out a thin.
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.740]   So that's really thin across your skin.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.460]   'Cause you don't wanna let it be thick
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.940]   because if you leave it thick over your skin,
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.580]   it'll just dry and flake off.
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.420]   And you don't wanna lose it 'cause it's expensive.
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.780]   So you wanna really spread it thin
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.740]   so it gets in all the grooves of your skin.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.980]   Okay, now this is what we learned
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.980]   from doing this experiment using pulverized C60 topically
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.100]   was that not all the C60 gets absorbed, as I mentioned.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.900]   And that activity matters.
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.500]   And so what I mean by that is that J has a physical job
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:06.540]   outside where he's huffing around, carrying heavy things.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.380]   And that's his job.
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.700]   Now my job is I work in an air-conditioned office.
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.260]   And so he's out there, sweating, his pores are open,
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.100]   obviously.
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.100]   And so he had a much higher absorption rate than I did.
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.300]   And so you can see what his example was here
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.500]   were morning and night.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.300]   And then here's mine.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.820]   Here's just one example.
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.980]   This was one of the early days when I'd splooshed out
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.180]   probably like five or six times more than I needed to.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.380]   And believe me, I didn't even sleep
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.100]   for a couple of days after this.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.380]   But this is what it looked like in the morning at 7 a.m.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.660]   And this is what it looked like at night at 7 p.m.
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.340]   You can see that a lot of this darkness
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.220]   had gotten soaked into my hand.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.700]   And of course, some does rub off.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.620]   But a lot of it gets absorbed.
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.260]   And then this is all that was remaining.
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.820]   After 7 p.m. I used the napkin.
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.060]   I wiped it off.
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.260]   And there wasn't that much.
[00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.020]   If I would have took a napkin to this,
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.580]   this would be black or brown, right?
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:58.020]   But when I wiped off at night, I was surprised that that much.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.060]   There was only that much left.
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.500]   And it really wasn't a lot.
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.660]   So this might look like it's a lot, but when you wipe it off,
[00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.100]   it's not.
[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.820]   So a lot of it got absorbed.
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.820]   But I still think that if you stay active
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.300]   and you have your sweaty, your hot, your pores are open,
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.780]   you're going to absorb a lot more.
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.140]   And that's just common sense.
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.180]   Now, the locations of our bodies that we were putting this on
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.540]   in our experiment was I was doing the back of the hand
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.700]   because I wear dress shirts and dress pants during the week.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.340]   And so I just-- I was the only exposed area of skin
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.820]   I could do it without the least amount of it
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.220]   getting rubbed off by clothes.
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.380]   Jay had a different way of doing things.
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.100]   And he used the crook of his elbow.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.060]   And I checked Mark there.
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.060]   Because that was what he really, really liked.
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.700]   It worked really well for him.
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.180]   He did try the inner wrist.
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.180]   Didn't work as well.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.420]   But so he's kind of voting for crook of elbow.
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.780]   For me, I haven't tried that yet.
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.780]   I'm just doing back to hand.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.300]   But he definitely said crook of elbow.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.940]   And one thing I want to add is, Jay also mentioned
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.260]   that after a week or so, it didn't
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.020]   seem like his body was absorbing much in the same place.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.860]   So he'd switch from one elbow to the next.
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.220]   And that seemed to continue to allow his body
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.980]   to absorb the maximum amount.
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:09.260]   So moving your dosing location around on your body
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.780]   it seemed to be a good thing.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.300]   Also, that we specifically picked places on our body
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.140]   where the veins were very close to the skin
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.140]   so that it went straight into the bloodstream
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.660]   as fast as possible and as much as possible.
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.740]   So close to the skin.
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.780]   It's close to the skin where your veins are.
[00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:26.740]   Stay active.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.140]   Keep your pores open and so forth.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.100]   So those are some of the things that we learned
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.740]   in terms of trying to absorb as much as you can.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.060]   We did also learn that between one and a half hours
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.900]   and three hours is how long it takes
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.700]   for the feeling to kick in when you know
[00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.660]   you're C60's in you and doing its job.
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.700]   The second thing too was that we both were experiencing
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.260]   the same thing, which was by taking C60 topically
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.940]   we had really high energy for two days
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.220]   with only sleeping about four hours a night.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.580]   And then there's a third day where your body just says,
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.820]   nope, no more, I'm not dealing with you.
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:59.140]   And I don't care how whatever, I'm just gonna get some sleep.
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.980]   So your body just shuts down on the third day.
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.380]   You get a full night's sleep and then you repeat it again.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.220]   But then what's interesting is after you kinda do this enough
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.860]   over a few weeks, there's a point where after like the sixth day
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.580]   your brain activity starts to balance.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:14.500]   You're not as amped up, but you're just kinda like
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.820]   the sustainable hum, you know, you're just doing really well.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:21.460]   You've got sustained energy, your mental acuity's really sharp
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.140]   and you just stay that way.
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.900]   And so that seems to be what we learned
[00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.380]   by taking C60 this way.
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.900]   And actually that's the same thing, right?
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.100]   If you take enough in oil, okay?
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.660]   Now Jay's a little crazier than I am.
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.020]   He actually wanted to see what it tastes like
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.740]   right out of the jar, which I don't know why,
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.100]   but he did, you know, it's in pure alcohol, right?
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.860]   It's carbon in pure alcohol.
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.620]   So anyway, he put it on his tongue and he said it tasted
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.260]   like something, I'm not the word that I shouldn't be using
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:51.340]   in the video, but he also said it tastes like charcoal.
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:55.500]   So he said it tastes like X and it tastes like charcoal,
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.580]   but it didn't leave any black stain on his tongue.
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.460]   And he definitely said he'll never do that again.
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.260]   So there you go, that's a little bit more experimentation.
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.860]   Results you didn't want to know.
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.740]   And then also too, there was no change to appetite,
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.820]   no appreciable change, neither one of us ate more or less,
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.020]   but we both are reporting weight loss in general
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.940]   from taking C60 for close to a year now.
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.580]   And also too, you know, he ran out.
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.420]   And so when he ran out of liquid C60, you know,
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.660]   Jay reports that he started to scrape it off the inside
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.700]   of the jar and kept like smearing it on his skin.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.180]   And that actually kept, that actually worked.
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.260]   So he made it last a little bit longer
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.300]   than it was ever intended to.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.180]   So he had like the little tip he wanted to share with everybody.
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.980]   And then lastly, you know, we both kind of learned
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.020]   that it helps to take a day off.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:41.300]   After a while, you know, it's wearing on your brain
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.020]   to be that alert and that awake and that sharp.
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:49.060]   And so I've come to now stop taking C60 on Sundays
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.900]   just to just give my body a day just to like shake it off.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.900]   And then I find that by taking a day off once a week from it,
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:00.260]   it just, I have a better effect from it for the rest of the week.
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.060]   So that's a suggestion as well that we both learned
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.060]   from doing this because C60 topically
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:11.060]   is a very, very strong way to take C60.
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.180]   And then, you know, I wanted to share this picture with you.
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:17.340]   This is my back of my hand at close zoom.
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:20.100]   This is one hour after application and muggy heat.
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.580]   And so this is, you know, typical Hawaii.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.900]   It's about, you know, 80 degrees, 75 humidity.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.100]   So it's really out, you know, I took my dogs to the park.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.260]   And so this was one hour after I put this on.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.900]   This was completely black.
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.620]   And then one hour later, you can see how my skin
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.100]   just sucked it all in, in the little canyons.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.020]   And so you can see where the C60 goes.
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.340]   It goes into every little line and crack
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.860]   and opening and pour of your hand
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.500]   and your body just absorbs it really quick.
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.420]   So I thought this was really interesting
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.460]   'cause when you look at your skin, you don't realize that.
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.620]   You're just a combination of little canyons.
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.780]   So the C60 definitely does absorb into your body
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.380]   and you definitely can feel it.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:59.540]   So I wanted to share with you also the economics behind this.
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.220]   So for the third way of using C60 topically,
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.580]   how does that come out from a cost standpoint?
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.100]   Well, at the end of the day, here's my simple math.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.420]   Bottom line, two gram bottle, 20 milliliters,
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.780]   take 0.12 milliliters per dose.
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.860]   That's 166 doses.
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.380]   And for the cost of C6 to this bottle from Red Lion,
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.020]   162 bucks was shipping.
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.540]   It comes out to 98 cents a day.
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.660]   It has 98 cents per dose.
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:28.260]   So I normally take one to two tablespoons a day.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.900]   And so to me, that'd be like two bucks,
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.380]   not even two bucks, right?
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.740]   So for regular folks taking one tablespoon a day,
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:37.820]   it'd be like a dollar a day
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.500]   for the same amount of C60
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.140]   that you would be having in a tablespoon of oil, right?
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.500]   We're talking quantities.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.340]   So it's really inexpensive.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.260]   I was really surprised how inexpensive this was.
[00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.980]   And compare that to olive oil.
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.260]   Now, if you took a look at the pricing guide,
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.500]   the most recent one I put out,
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.620]   the average cost per ounce of C60 olive oil
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.460]   is 10 dollars and 60 cents an ounce.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.020]   And so one tablespoon is roughly half an ounce.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.340]   So it's like five bucks a day.
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.140]   So if you're taking C60 olive oil,
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.100]   it's about five dollars a day at a tablespoon a day.
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.540]   Compare that to dollar a day
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.620]   if you took it just directly, no oil.
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:16.820]   So it's interesting from an economic standpoint as well,
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.780]   in terms of making the decision to try it or not.
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.340]   Anyway, I did want to share lastly
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.820]   that there are some downsides.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.100]   The downsides to taking pulverized C60 on your hands
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.580]   or I'm sorry on your skin
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.300]   is that it's just messy.
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.060]   It's really easy, like I said, with that needle
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.860]   and with the scoopers and all the things you do,
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.860]   it's just so messy.
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.140]   It's kind of like, it's like paint.
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.780]   And so, and then it gets stuck in the needle
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.500]   and you push out and put it in a sploosh
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.180]   and then you got a big old sploosh all over.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.100]   I got it on my clothes a bunch of times, on my desk.
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:46.980]   It's just messy.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.460]   And so it's really easy to put too much out.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.940]   And when you do, it's wasteful.
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.620]   It messes with your sleep if you take too much.
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.340]   And then there's this thing that Jay came up with.
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.220]   He calls it the Lucy effect.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.420]   When you end up taking too much
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.100]   'cause you spilled it on yourself,
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.860]   it's like the movie Lucy where the girl gets her brain
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.980]   just kind of goes wacky on that stuff.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.780]   And she just starts to activate more and more
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.220]   and more of her brain.
[00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.300]   That's kind of how he describes the feeling.
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:14.140]   I know what he means.
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.020]   I call it like sharpness, mental acuity.
[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.300]   It's like, it's really hard to describe what happens
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:22.140]   when you take too much pulled ricey 60 on your skin.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.700]   You get like this, you're in this zone thing
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:25.860]   and it's the Lucy effect.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.220]   He calls it that I agree.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.060]   Good term for it.
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.100]   It's, yeah, it's wild.
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.380]   It's really like you don't sleep
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.260]   but you're just really, really alert.
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.700]   And so that's kind of a downside because, you know,
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:41.420]   sleep is a good thing and you miss it when you don't get to.
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.180]   Okay, so the other thing I kind of mentioned
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:44.260]   is messy and it gets on your clothes.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.460]   And lastly, you know, you're weird.
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.980]   And I didn't realize this part about my experiment.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.380]   It didn't even occur to me, but, you know, here I am.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.060]   I'm putting it on the back of my hand
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.700]   and then I'm going to my office, right?
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.940]   Now, you know, Jay's out in the tundra.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.900]   He's got it in his shirt, so no one sees him doing it.
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.740]   But, you know, I mean, I don't want to get it
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:01.940]   on my work clothes, so I just put him
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.500]   in the back of my hand, right?
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.580]   So day one, I'm out there.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.540]   It's like a Monday and I got this smudge on my hand
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.740]   and people are looking at me like,
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.620]   "Hey, so what's on your hand?"
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.980]   And I'm like, "Oh, yeah, I was just doing some stuff
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.460]   this week and I got some stuff on my hand."
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:18.460]   They're like, "Oh, okay," and, you know, they're thinking,
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.260]   "I got paint on me or something."
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.460]   And then the next day, they see me again, and then we say anything,
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.460]   and then finally somebody says, "What's on your hand?"
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.460]   You know, "I know I just still got that stain."
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.460]   You're like, "Oh, yeah, well, you know, I'm just doing..."
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.460]   You know, "I just got some stuff on my hand."
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.460]   And after a while, people kind of look at you like,
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.460]   "This guy don't wash his hands."
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.460]   You know, and it's just get that whole weird thing
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.460]   like you're standing in an elevator with somebody you know
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.460]   that they know you, but you don't remember each other's names
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.460]   that don't wash his hands.
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.460]   And so finally, finally, this is the kicker.
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.460]   So finally, on the fifth day, somebody finally looks at me and goes,
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.460]   "What's on your hand?"
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.460]   And I'm like, "Oh, so I go, "Oh, I do a science channel on YouTube
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:56.460]   where I'm studying the effects of a particular carbon allotrope
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.460]   applied topically on my skin in a monomolecular form."
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.460]   And I just stared at them.
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.460]   And they looked at me, they looked at my hand,
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.460]   they looked at me, and they went, "Oh, they walked away."
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.460]   And then that's the answer I give everybody now,
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.460]   and they all just look at me, look at my hand,
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.460]   and they walk away.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:16.460]   So you're weird if you do this, so be prepared.
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.460]   So anyway, with all that said, I want to just conclude this video
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.460]   and just say thank you so much.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.460]   I hope you learned something today.
[00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.460]   I'm just sharing what I've learned, and I'm glad that I'm also
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.460]   reading your comments about what you're learning
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.460]   and what you're experiencing, so keep doing that.
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.460]   And thank you very much.
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:35.460]   Using C60 topically, there's a lot more studies on it.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.460]   It goes a lot farther back than ingesting C60 oil,
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.460]   and there's multiple ways you can do it.
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.460]   And you know what, and it might be even more economical.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.460]   So there's a lot of real interesting things about
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:52.460]   taking C60 topically that I thought was worth learning about
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.460]   and definitely worth sharing.
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.460]   Thank you again for your time.
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.460]   I know it's precious.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.460]   I really appreciate you stopping by, and a lot.
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:00.460]   Have a great day.
