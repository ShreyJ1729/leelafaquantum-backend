[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900]   Aloha, everyone, and welcome to another ElectroHealing video.
[00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.640]   I am your host, Camar, and I've got a very, very special treat for you.
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.600]   In the 20 years that I've been tinkering around with bioelectric magnetics, devices
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.960]   from the Lacoskey Multiwave Oscillator, Raymond Rife, PEMF, Scenars, Zappers, you name it,
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.160]   I've never had the opportunity to actually speak to someone who uses these devices day
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.560]   to day in a practice, a wellness practice, and especially in combination with Chinese
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.840]   traditional medicine and also Ayurvedic.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.760]   And here is Anna Steele.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.240]   I had this incredible chat with her last night, and I just wanted to share it with you, because
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.320]   if you've ever wondered, what's the best way or how, and how does bioelectric magnetic
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.520]   devices fit into the healing art, because we're talking about whole body healing.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.600]   There's no one silver bullet.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.200]   It's going to fix your overall issues that you have with your whole body.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.560]   It's a combination.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.440]   It's an art form, and it really is.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.720]   And she has kind of created this approach called Unblock, Realign, and Restore, where
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.680]   she shares how she does it, how she fits in bioelectric magnetic devices into this overall
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.240]   approach, and the incredible journeys that people have in their healing.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.680]   People who barely can walk, can walk again, and things like that.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.920]   And it's just an amazing discussion.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.760]   She shares this valuable wealth of information as well as her experiences over the last, I
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.360]   guess, over 10 years of just studying the healing arts and being a practitioner and a
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.360]   healer herself.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.160]   So it's a great talk.
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.680]   I just really am just really excited to share this treat with you.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.520]   So I want to just first of all, before I start, I want to say thank you to Anna.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.080]   I really appreciate your time, your insights, your information, just the fact that you exist.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.120]   If we just had thousands of you on the planet, it would just be so much better from the standpoint
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:11.520]   of people actually getting healed and cured and helped, which doesn't always happen as
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.520]   we all know.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.240]   So thank you so much, Anna.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.080]   And then I want to thank everyone for watching this and coming along with us and listening
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.080]   and learning.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.640]   And then if you want to learn more, I always just want to point out that I have a blog.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.720]   It's called The Tinkers Academy.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.720]   And you can just type in Tinkers.academy and you're all window and you'll come over to
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.240]   our blog or my blog.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.200]   And then there's the Electro healing telegram chat group.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.560]   That's how I met Anna.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.040]   And so we have a chat group just about Electro healing devices, all the ones that I mentioned
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.040]   even more.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.040]   I just finished series.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.600]   I do series every week on different topics.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.120]   So come on over and join the group.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.120]   And Anna's in there.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.280]   I'm in there and a lot of other people in there who are just as equally curious about
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.240]   these types of devices and how they can help our wellness.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.800]   So again, thank you, Anna.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.880]   Thank you for listening to this video.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.800]   Really appreciate you stopping by and I hope you enjoy the interview.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   Aloha.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.560]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another video by me, Kay Elmer.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.840]   And I am very, very excited to be able to share with you a chat with Anna, who is a
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.240]   trained Chinese traditional medicine practitioner who's also practices Ayurvedic medicine.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.640]   And she lives in Bali, which is in Indonesia.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.920]   And we met on our telegram chat group for the Electro healing series.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.440]   And it just was amazing, you know, what she was talking about because she's the first
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.840]   practitioner I've ever spoken to, who's actually incorporated the use of Electro healing, specifically
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.840]   the Likovsky multi wave oscillator and the violet ray into her practice among other devices
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.160]   that we'll talk about.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.920]   I'm hoping and, you know, it just was amazing what she had to say about how she uses Electro
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.080]   magnetics in her practice along with the traditional healing arts.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.440]   And we just had to have her on on a interview and wanted to share that with you.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.040]   So Anna, welcome.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.040]   Thank you so much for joining me.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.040]   How are you?
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.040]   Hello.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.180]   Thank you for inviting me.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.920]   Yeah, excited to talk to you.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.640]   You know, it's so cool to actually meet someone and I'm a tinker.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.040]   I just play with these things and use them on myself successfully, by the way, but but
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.260]   you're actually out there healing other folks and and that's just amazing.
[00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.960]   So, you know, my first question is really is, you know, how did, well, you're trained,
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.080]   you know, CTM practitioner and you do have air vetics, right, but, you know, like a little
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.080]   bit about your background.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.300]   How did you get into that and how long have you been doing it?
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.560]   Well, I, for most of my life, I was in arts and fashion.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.480]   I had my own fashion label and after a few seasons of doing that, like seven seasons,
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.080]   I was pretty finished, like, I know how this works.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.840]   It's not really giving me anything new and I don't know what I'm going to do, but I'm
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.920]   not going to do this anymore.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.840]   So I finished that and I started looking on the internet about things I actually really
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.520]   cared about, especially with to do with the pyramids and what's the truth of the universe?
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.680]   Where did I come from?
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.680]   Am I an alien?
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.440]   Like, you know, all of that kind of rabbit holy stuff?
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.040]   And through that investigation, I found out about the Vedas, you know, the traditional
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:39.280]   Indian scriptures and inside of that investigation, I discovered Ayurveda, which is called the
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.360]   Science of Life.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.640]   And I thought, well, that's actually taking some boxes to my questions.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:53.800]   So I found a course in New Zealand, a one-year diploma course on Ayurvedic lifestyle management,
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.380]   and I moved out to the bush or the New Zealand jungle and I enrolled in the course and I
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:09.640]   started studying Ayurveda, which was all about body therapies and doshes and herbs and just,
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.420]   you know, how to balance your constitution through food.
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:20.500]   And in that time, I met someone who was on one of the other courses at the same college
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.740]   and he had already done an acupuncture diploma.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.740]   It was only a diploma at that time.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:33.000]   And he gave me an acupuncture session and that's when I felt all this energy moving throughout
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.960]   my body and shooting out my hands and my feet and I was like, oh my God, this is like magic.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:49.460]   I need to learn this because I hadn't really felt that kind of energetic flow since I started
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.440]   meditating when I was actually about 17, but by the time I got to do that acupuncture experience,
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:04.600]   I was 29, so I'd had a bit of time off during the meditation things where when I did start
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.120]   meditating, actually, I started feeling my own energy field in the form of being able
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.320]   to feel the magnetic field that comes off your body.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.680]   So I knew all about that and then when I had acupuncture, it all sort of started coming
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.320]   back again and I was like, okay, I need to change study and study acupuncture.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:30.880]   So I enrolled in that degree and that began in 2010 and that was a four-year degree and
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:38.800]   that's where I learned acupuncture, different other Chinese body therapies like cupping
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:47.240]   and gua sha and all of that stuff and we had to learn Chinese medicine theory of balance
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.680]   and then pathology and worse I had to learn Western medicine in terms of anatomy and
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:08:00.080]   physiology and pathology and pharmacology, research, all of that.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.440]   And then I also did an inside of that time frame.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:11.040]   I did a two-year diploma in qigong and Tai Chi and I also learned how to do healing with
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.680]   qigong, medical qigong.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.960]   So I started trying these herbs.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:25.120]   So it just became like a transition out of party-party fashion version of myself back
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:33.600]   into self-healing because throughout that whole degree process, I was healing my own
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.960]   consciousness and my physical body from my old lifestyle and also my mother had passed
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.400]   away when I had my fashion business.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.920]   So there was a lot of emotional stuff that needed to be processed.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:52.200]   So it was quite fortunate to be in that school because it was such a tight little unit in
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   a small school.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:09:01.800]   It was like having a family that really understood me and was really supportive for that time.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.400]   So yeah, that's how it all started.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:14.400]   So that study was from 2009 to 2013, was when I graduated the degree.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:23.160]   And then after that, I took a year off to go around the world and just my first objective
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.760]   was to go to China and see how the Chinese people did Chinese medicine in China.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:36.720]   I was really curious about the differences in practice and are we getting it locked over
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.480]   in New Zealand, is it the same?
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:48.400]   And I ended up just visiting Shanghai University and followed the doctor around his clinic
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.400]   in the hospital.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:54.440]   I went to Wuhan University and followed the doctors around the hospitals.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.520]   I went to the world, medical qigong conference in Beijing and met with a couple of my teachers
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.520]   there.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:05.400]   I toured around China, then I toured around Europe for three months.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:13.000]   And that's where I learned actually about sound healing as I was in Glastonbury.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.160]   And there was a guy there that he owns like a crystal, the local crystal shop, and he'd
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.360]   just been to Beijing teaching Chinese medical doctors about sound healing.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:30.720]   And he was a sound healer, so I got an appointment with him to have that experience, and he used
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:37.640]   crystal sound instruments and his voice and crystal grid layouts while you're lying on
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.040]   the table and just like a session for me there.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   And one of the instruments that he used on me was this ginormous crystal tuning fork.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.000]   And then he showed me a smaller version and I was looking at it and I was like, "Hey, we
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.660]   could use this for acupuncture."
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.120]   Instead of a needle, you can put the tuning fork on the acupuncture point.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:05.000]   So I bought a couple of books and tuning forks, started investigating into how to use sound
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.040]   vibration in combination with acupuncture, meridian theory.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.760]   So that was that first bit.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:29.160]   And then after Europe, I entered into South America and I ended up volunteering with a
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.360]   woman that lived in the jungle.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:40.320]   And she was a professor of Chinese medicine and naturopathy, and she had a jungle clinic
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:49.680]   and she'd been living in Peru for like the last 12 years or something, very beautiful,
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.480]   wise, intelligent healer.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:59.920]   And she was using bio resonance machines in the jungle of Peru in combination with acupuncture
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:07.000]   and Chinese medicine and ear acupuncture and cupping, and she was healing cancer patients.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.200]   So I got to live with her for about three months.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:18.040]   And it's probably when I first started getting into the interest of bio resonance machines.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.040]   Wow.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:26.320]   Your story is my wish list if I could just divorce myself from my day job.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.820]   Wow, that's amazing.
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.160]   So what happened after Peru?
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:41.040]   I went to Ecuador for a month, traveled around with these Colombian people.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.680]   I'd met in a hostel, just did that.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:52.880]   And then I returned to New Zealand with like no job, no money, no job lined up.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.360]   And I was like, oh my God, what are we going to do?
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:04.080]   And a friend of mine had a countryside lifestyle property, like not a farm, but like a small
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.160]   farm kind of set up for one family.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.240]   And she says, why don't you come and stay and the carrot, we can get the caravan, put
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240]   it on the property.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.760]   You can be the gardener and just take time and you can be my gardener and just sort your
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.840]   shit out and decide what you need to do.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:28.680]   So in that time, I spent about eight months living in a caravan, being a gardener, processing
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.800]   my last 10 months of journeying around the world and learning all these amazing things
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.480]   and meeting all these amazing people.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:40.520]   And the time I was in Peru, I just basically studied the whole time on sound healing and
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:47.240]   chanting and using tuning forks and reading up a lot on like quantum healing and stuff
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.320]   like that.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:55.000]   So when I came back to New Zealand and all I was doing was gardening, meditating, doing
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.560]   a bit of acupuncture on other people and drawing sacred geometry.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:05.440]   That's kind of what I was doing, really, really grounding myself.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:12.440]   And in that time, it seemed to like unlock my brain, I think especially with the practice
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:19.200]   of drawing the geometrical patterns by hand, plus I was digging my hands in the earth every
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:25.880]   day and accessing the real internet, it started to unpack all of the information that I learned
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:30.040]   and filled up my brain with for the last five, six years.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:37.720]   And I started getting all these meditations and dreams and visions about harmonics and
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:43.640]   octaves and time travel and moving through dimensions.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:49.040]   And I was seeing things in meditation and then I'd look up on Google, I'd find a Google
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.320]   image and I'd click on it and then it would show me that this is called a Taurus.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:15:00.160]   I'm like, oh, cool, so I'm learning physics, through experience, through meditation, through
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:09.680]   this kind of experiential display of, yeah, I don't know if that makes sense, but it was
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:17.800]   like everything I'd ever studied, it all just came into account, yeah.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:24.440]   I love the way you describe it, it is the first and true internet is the earth.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.360]   Everything's connected, so that's really cool.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.580]   So you've, so then when you got to Indonesia and you started a practice or your own practice
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:38.640]   or you're part of a practice and you're seeing, you know, I've been clients, right?
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.400]   I've been an engineer a year and a half.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.840]   It was probably in 2015 was when I was living in the caravan and then I thought, okay, I
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.480]   don't really have any money.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.480]   I could probably get a job.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.480]   Yeah, let's get a job.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:59.600]   I applied for a job as an acupuncturist and I started as a money and I was the acupuncturist
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:05.520]   with a physiotherapy clinic for about a year and a half and in that time I was seeing a
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.680]   lot of clients, like I think in my busiest week I saw 40 people in one week, which was
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:18.880]   one hour a point, so that's 40 hours back to back of clients and I was meditating a lot
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:25.480]   in that time as well and I started getting quite psychically tuned to my clients where
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.080]   I would be able to pick up information just by touching them.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:37.360]   I was picking up past lives from people and I was really just going deeply into pure practice.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:46.920]   It was probably the first time I'd really just only done acupuncture 24/7 and I did that
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:52.840]   for a year and a half and then I left that company and opened up my own home practice
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:17:00.040]   when I lived in a community in New Zealand and I did that for another couple of years
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:07.600]   and then come sort of end of 2018, beginning of 2019, I actually got in touch with someone
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:17.480]   that I met 14 years ago in New Zealand at a party of mutual friends and he was the person
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:23.720]   that designed the multi-wave honor, he wrote the handbook on the multi-wave oscillator back
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.720]   in the 1980s.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.520]   Yeah, it was that book.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:35.040]   And I just happened to have bought one because this friend of mine on the community were
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.760]   talking about energy-healing stuff and by resonance and he said, "Oh, have you heard
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.760]   of a Likovsky machine?"
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:41.760]   I'm like, "Nah."
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:45.800]   Because I was telling him about my experience in Peru because the doctor there, she was
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:54.640]   using the BRS machine and I looked up Likovsky machine and then I found that there was someone
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.600]   selling them in New Zealand and Auckland.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:04.600]   So I called him up and I ordered one and then I found this person that I met 14 years
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.640]   ago, he had written the handbook and I got in contact with him and I'm like, "Hey, do
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.400]   you remember me?"
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.680]   I've got one of those machines, I'd really love your advice and you sent me the handbook
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:22.120]   again and we got talking and it ended up that he was just living in Bali and he ended
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:30.520]   up getting me a job to come over to work on like a sort of a community project.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:35.240]   So that's how I got over here.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:41.740]   So currently you're using the Likovsky multi-wave oscillator in your practice, correct?
[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:49.160]   And do you use it solely by itself or do you combine it with acupuncture and aerobatic
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.840]   when you're treating clients?
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:56.720]   Yeah, so when I'm using aerobatic stuff, I'm just giving like diet and lifestyle advice.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:04.800]   I don't do herbs, I do suggest herbs that are more patented, safe things.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:12.040]   With multi-wave oscillator, the minimum general treatment you'll use at four time-wise is
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:20.480]   about 21 minutes and that basically activates all of the cells back to getting into their
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:27.800]   original oscillation so it's helping the healthy cellular movement get stronger and amplitude.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:34.120]   So I put someone on that machine first and then I'll get them to come onto the treatment
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:40.200]   table and I'll start doing body work with them which is essentially unblocking all of
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:48.440]   them meridians, generally using my pointy thumbs with acupressure which is a lot more
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:55.880]   effective I've found than just doing straight up acupuncture because you're really able
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:01.460]   to diagnose through touch where the blockages are just through feeling the fascia and the
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.460]   tissues.
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:07.960]   So I go down all of the leg on the yin and yang channels right up to the toes and I squeeze
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:13.200]   the toes under the toes and where there's pain, it means there's a blockage and a lot
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:19.560]   of people have got when I do that to them it's quite painful but it's also very, very relieving
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:26.320]   because it's helping to basically unblock the waterways and move all of the energy can
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.320]   finally move again.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.160]   So I do that on the arms and legs and then I incorporate abdominal massage and lymphatic
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:40.400]   drainage, maybe use acupuncture at that point and then get them to roll over, lie on their
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:47.080]   front and I'll get into unlocking their pelvis and the upper back with lymphatic drainage
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:55.840]   and using acupuncture on certain points to release joints and then at that point using
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:00.760]   pulse magnet therapy, once all of the blockages are out of the way, maybe doing structural
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.200]   alignment for the pelvis as well and once that's all in the right position then I'll
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.880]   put the pulse magnet therapy.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.680]   Does it make sense?
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.680]   Yeah, it does.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:20.040]   So when you start someone off in the multi wave oscillator, what power level do you put
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.040]   them in?
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:29.120]   Because the original lacoskey formula by Dr. Lacoskey was set the antennas maximum 33
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:36.000]   inches apart, power level at 50% and then it was 15 minutes every other day.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.320]   And that was as a treatment just using the multi wave oscillator but it seems like you're
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:46.960]   using the oscillator and combining it which I totally think is the right approach because
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.960]   there is no one silver bullet for anything and it's a whole body approach because you
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:55.660]   know we're complicated machines actually.
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.760]   So is that the kind of like, so when you do 21 minutes is it set at like 50% power and
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:07.960]   then the distances between the, and how do you position the client between the antenna?
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:14.080]   Are they parallel to it or perpendicular to the antenna?
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.520]   Just real curious because I have one myself, right?
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:24.920]   I want to know how to, from the set up, like my machine was built by someone in Australia.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:32.540]   So this particular design, like the Tesla cars inside the black box that has the two
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:38.720]   cords going out to the harmonic resonators, there is no power setting, it's only on or
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.720]   off.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   Okay.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:48.040]   And I am trying to get a information on what wattage it's producing because it didn't
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:55.120]   come with that information, it only has a title and an on button and then on the side
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:04.360]   of it there's a dial and that dial puts the spark gap closer or far apart to itself because
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:12.440]   the pin will wear down into the masculine and feminine, you know, as the pins wear down,
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:17.440]   one end will be like a positive and one will be a negative, one's kind of sending energy
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:25.520]   and one's receiving and after a while, that piece of metal will, you know, lose its structure
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:34.400]   so you do slightly have to adjust the spark gap to get the right capacitance discharge
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:41.200]   and sometimes I clean it out because it has like the carbon build up inside the spark gap
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:47.920]   but basically it's just switch it on.
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:53.680]   So you know, I am just showing some stock photos of people being treated by the Lukovsky
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:58.220]   multi-wave oscillator, so when you have people sitting, as it's sitting and just sitting
[00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:04.320]   like this in between the coils or more like that, you know, in terms of just side.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.320]   More like that.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.320]   Okay.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.320]   That's how I sit on.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:13.320]   And my coils are twice the size of those coils more like that.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.320]   Oh, okay.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.320]   You're minor effect size.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.320]   Okay.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.320]   Is that bigger than that?
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.320]   Okay.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.320]   All right.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.320]   Cool.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:28.320]   And so, you know, we had a chat yesterday and I'd love for you to, if you don't mind just
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.280]   kind of repeating yourself, but you had this really incredible point to make about the
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:40.600]   healing process and what the Lukovsky actually, its purpose, right, is as the step one of
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.800]   your process is to unblock.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:51.240]   And I kind of related that to the teaching Dr. Jerry Tenet, when he looks at his approach
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:56.000]   to it was the concept of that muscle, the muscles are batteries for our organs in terms
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.760]   of us being a biological, you know, machines, right?
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:05.640]   And that if you ever let an organ or a battery muscle pack drain down to zero, it switches
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:11.280]   polarity and it won't hold a charge unless you switch that polarity back into normal
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:18.200]   and then you apply electrons in it, you charge yourself back up as an energy being, right?
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.440]   And then you were kind of making the same point in a different way.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.560]   So could you kind of talk about that in terms of like, you know, the whole idea of starting
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:30.800]   the healing process is first remove blockages and is that what you use the multi-wave oscillator
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   for?
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:44.480]   Yes, so when you think about it say that again, well, correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:50.040]   Well, yeah, I mean, because one thing about the muscle I've oscillated that I've learned
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:56.160]   is quite interesting, we have these two opposing harmonic resonator antenna, right?
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:02.360]   And they've got 12 rings and each ring is producing a different frequency bandwidth,
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:07.280]   which is, and I don't know if you've done on yours, a few ring, that outside one, and
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.720]   then you ring the next one and the next one and the next one, they're actually changed
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.120]   to the octave scale and the chromatic scale of the piano.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:22.080]   So the side ring is C and then it was C#, D, E on and on, they're actually tuned musically.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.080]   Right.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:29.360]   So when you think about it all in terms of musical waves and these two antenna are facing
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:36.400]   each other and they're pushing out electrical waves that hit each other in the middle.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:42.600]   So it's almost having a phase cancellation effect with all of these different tones which
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.920]   produce different octaves all at once.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:50.440]   That's why it's a multi-wave oscillator because there's so many different waveforms all happening
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.440]   at once.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.440]   Right.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:57.480]   And then when you fire those waveforms towards each other, they're crashing the middle.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.240]   And where does that energy go?
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:05.120]   That produces another waveform, which is like a third wave, which is a effect of this phase
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:11.200]   cancellation, which I'm studying into and learned that that creates actually a scalar
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.200]   field.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.200]   Oh.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:18.440]   And the scalar field is the interesting thing about the multi-wave oscillator effect when
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:27.400]   it is talking about ability to do anti-aging because a scalar field, what I've learned,
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.240]   you cannot measure a scalar field as a scalar wave, it's nonsense.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.240]   Right.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:37.920]   So it's a scalar field meaning that scalar energy is in all places all at once right
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.920]   now.
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.920]   Right.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:43.880]   So that's why when you sit in the multi-wave oscillator, it changes your perception of time
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.400]   and space.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.680]   So you can sit in that machine for five minutes and feel like it's been three hours.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.760]   We can sit in there half an hour and feel like only five minutes has passed.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:59.000]   And it changes the perception of the past present and future.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.800]   So I've sat in there in the now connecting to something that happened in the past with
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:09.200]   people that are in my general vicinity and everything kind of meshes into this zero
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.120]   point where everything's happening now.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:20.720]   And what that said to do is actually help to regrow the telomeres on the end of the DNA,
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   which have been described as like the little cats on the shoelaces.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:34.480]   And if the DNA is the shoelace and the telomere is the cap on the end, it reduces as we age.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.600]   And when it gets right down to the shoelace and the cap is gone, the DNA will start to
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.600]   fragment and get disrupted.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.240]   And it's said that the wave oscillator can help to regrow the telomeres, which is the
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.120]   anti-aging effect.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:59.760]   So that's a little bit off topic of your question, but it's good to know that is how it's working.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:08.160]   So when you think about that in terms of the human biology, there's a great book you can
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:17.520]   read called The Water Codes and in that book, they state that 99% of the molecules of the
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.640]   human body are water molecules.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.160]   99% of our molecular structure is water.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:34.200]   And so if you imagine that in terms of the Chinese meridian flow system, you will realize
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.880]   that water needs to flow.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:44.240]   And that's why they call it meridians or the rivers of the body because it's a waterway.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:55.320]   And so what happens in nature when you view a river, and maybe that river has some sticks
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:30:01.480]   or leaves or twigs or too much mud, what's going to happen to the quality of that water
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.080]   running through the river, it's going to have blockages.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:10.920]   And there'll be areas where that water can't flow efficiently, especially if it's trying
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:17.640]   to flow from a shoulder to an elbow to a wrist to a finger joint, because all of that dirty
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.480]   water gets stuck in joints.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:27.360]   And that's why we have acupuncture points at these certain junctions of the body, especially
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:32.200]   where the bony areas join bony areas or muscles join muscles.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:39.440]   That's where the acupuncture points are located to allow to basically cause a change in the
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:46.160]   waterway flow and move the water more efficiently through the river.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:55.120]   So when I'm working with people, I first like to see how is the river flowing, and any time
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:00.880]   you push on someone's body down the meridians and they experience pain, you know that that
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.280]   meridian has a blockage.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.080]   So that's what massage does and twinar and all of that kind of, you know, through pushing,
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.480]   rereleasing the pain, you're actually helping to unblock the waterways.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:20.600]   So that has to be done first, and another reason for blocked waterways is the body might be
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.960]   too cold and the water's too cold.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:30.220]   So when you notice a river in the wintertime, it might be frozen on the top and a little
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.640]   trickle is running underneath.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.560]   But it's not because the water's gone anywhere, the water's just trapped in the ice.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:42.000]   And when you melt the ice, all the water returns to the flow system, and then it can start
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.840]   circulation.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.880]   So a lot of the time when I work with people, I have to check their temperature, especially
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:52.480]   around their pelvis, because a lot of people have cold, and if you've got cold in your
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.720]   pelvis, you don't have circulation to your legs.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.400]   And if you've got cold in your pelvis, you don't have much of a digestive function going
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.000]   on too.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.920]   So it becomes like, let's check where the blockages are, we get that moving, and then
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:11.080]   you have to get the body up to the right temperature, which I consider cold to be another blockage.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:16.280]   This is where the Chinese and the holistic stuff starts coming in.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:23.120]   So once you wake the body up with the multi-wave oscillator and get all the cells kind of detoxing,
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.320]   because it's generally a big detox for the cells once they come back into alignment,
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.520]   that's getting out blockages.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:36.920]   So would you say that because a multi-wave oscillator has a detoxing effect, that it's
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:41.060]   important that after you do that, that you actually need to then kind of go through a
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:46.760]   detox regimen, either through a massage, or I was going to ask you, is that what the PEMF
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:55.680]   is for is to pulse the body and help the bioelectrics or the biomagnetism at that point, kind of
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:02.840]   pulsating to help move those toxins out of the body and then stimulate the cells at
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.840]   that point?
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.760]   Or what do you use the PMF for at the end?
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:13.520]   Well, when we talked yesterday, I talked about these three principles, which is unblock,
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.720]   realign and restore.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.280]   So we just talked about unblocking.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:24.800]   So it means that the energy has free movement in the meridian system as water.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:31.400]   And then realign means get the structure in the right position.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:38.000]   So for example, if I had a car accident and I slammed my pelvis out of place, and 20 years
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.720]   later, it never got treated, the water can't flow through a tilted pelvis, therefore, if
[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.800]   I don't put that pelvis back into the right position, we're not going to have a full circulatory
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.360]   system or circuit system.
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:59.520]   So I do a lot of body work to get the physical structures back into alignment.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:06.020]   Also to do with that, you might have had a trauma to your arm with some kind of accident
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.840]   and you've got a huge scar.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:13.680]   And what we know about scars is that what they look like on the surface, under the surface,
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:20.720]   they're generally two to three times thicker, like the iceberg, under the water.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:23.600]   It's bigger than the surface area.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:29.800]   So if you've got a scar in your meridian, Jerry Tennant talks about this too, unblocking
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:36.920]   the scars, is that your circuitry flow, your electron flow has met a blockage.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.600]   So I can't flow properly through that.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:46.360]   So scar therapy is something I focus on as well to realign.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:53.400]   And especially people that have had abdominal surgical work and women that have had cesarean
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:35:00.920]   sections, which is unfortunately all too common these days, having a C section from side to
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.960]   side cuts through half of your meridians or your torso.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:10.080]   And then how do you expect the electrical energy to flow through that?
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:18.440]   So that's when things like castor oil remedy comes in really handy because castor oil,
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:23.160]   when you apply it topically, it can penetrate four inches into the body.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:27.840]   And what it does when it's inside your body, it breaks up adhesions, which are internal
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:28.840]   scars.
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:35.640]   So if you start combining this kind of stuff in, so that's helping to break up blockages
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:42.880]   again, using acupuncture, using moxibustion, also using pulse magnet therapy for that,
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.280]   I've end the violet ray.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:55.800]   So for example, I had a client last year and she was at her 60s, late 60s from England,
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.440]   so very cold country.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:05.240]   And she had been a point ballet dancer all her life, so her feet were quite traumatized
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.280]   from being on point shoes.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.360]   And she'd had a double knee surgery, and she'd also had a double hip surgery.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:17.960]   And she had lumbar spinal stenosis, which means that where the nerves pass through the
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:24.400]   holes of the spine, there's calcification of the bone, which means that the bone grows
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:29.720]   too much and it will squeeze the nerve, which means that the nerve passing from the lower
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.760]   back into the legs has been compromised.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.320]   So with all of that going on, plus she had a very cold pelvis.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:44.720]   She was freezing cold, so you can't circulate things in a cold system.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:50.920]   Our body is built to be operating at 36.7 degrees Celsius, so if it's colder than that,
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.600]   you're going to have a slower function.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:37:02.200]   So I did a lot of acupressure on her, on her legs and a lot of foot massage, like really
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.240]   getting in there, because she couldn't feel her feet.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:11.160]   She was literally walking on crutches because she could not feel her feet for a year.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:16.160]   And she relied on crutches to walk, like when her foot touched the ground, she couldn't
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.560]   have a sense of anything.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:25.240]   So I had a lot of massage, I had a lot of acupressure on her legs, on all of the channels.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:30.080]   And then when I got to her knees, they had big, big scars from the operations.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:35.440]   So as I spoke, just earlier, the scars under the surface of creating a lot of blockage
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:40.680]   for the electron flow in the circuit system, which is called meridian system.
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:48.240]   So putting on castor oil, oh no, what did I do?
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:59.000]   Magnesium spray, magnesium chloride spray, Lugol's iodine, 15%, because this is basically
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.400]   cellular ingredients, we need these as minerals.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:09.320]   Also putting on castor oil, and then using the violet ray.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:16.800]   So the violet ray detoxes cells, it increases circulation and it decreases inflammation.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:23.240]   So using that on the scars, and then after a few minutes of the violet ray, you can now
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:29.520]   use it for five minutes per area, so you don't cause too much tissue heat, doing that on
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:40.160]   the scars, and then putting the pulse magnet on for 10 minutes each knee.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:48.000]   Then I treated her three times a week, and one week, and by the end of the third session,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.920]   she was able to walk across the street without crutches.
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:55.520]   Wow, okay, wow, that's amazing.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.680]   I get it, okay, so that's unblock.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:09.440]   I didn't even use an acupuncture needle, you don't have to be trained in acupuncture to
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.960]   do this.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:19.160]   All I did was acupress, castor oil, massage, violet ray, pulse magnet therapy, and putting
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.020]   on the right cellular ingredients.
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:27.560]   So the cells then have nutrients to make blocks to do cellular functions.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.800]   Right, so I get it.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:35.800]   So basically applying the oils and the iodine, give this cell the nutrients it needs.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:44.680]   The violet ray provides like a frequency and bioelectrics and multi-frequency similar to
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:49.920]   the multi-wave oscillator, but not as pronounced, but it creates an electroporation effect which
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.760]   allows the body to absorb, or the cells to absorb all of those nutrients, right?
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:40:03.460]   And then the pulse magnetic frequency is really where, I guess to me, it's like, it
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:08.080]   exercises your magnetics and it actually pumps energy into you.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.080]   So you then you pump.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.080]   Exactly.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.080]   So that you can.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.080]   I totally consider both.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.080]   It's an ingredient.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.600]   I can see how you mix those two together.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.600]   It's almost done.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.880]   So in the post-magnet therapy, you're heading the voltage to.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:26.320]   Because I always thought of them, yeah, I never thought of mixing the two, but that makes
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.320]   so much sense.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:32.560]   Because you know, I read a lot of the Edgar Cayce readings, you know, there's over, of
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:36.120]   all of his readings, I think he did, you know, a couple of tens of thousands.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:44.000]   But I do know that around 750 to maybe 900, I think, Edgar Cayce readings where it was
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.920]   when he was in his coherent state, he basically diagnosed the patient and then prescribed
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:55.480]   them to use the violet ray as you just described.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:41:01.560]   And in very similar ways that Dr. Jerry Tennant uses the bio, you know, biomodulator in terms
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:07.960]   of recharging his organs and their battery patch, you know, basically charge them up
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.680]   using the violet ray.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:14.280]   So yeah, it's really, that's an amazing device to use.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.280]   And it's so cute to go home.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.280]   Let me back.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:21.480]   Oh, I'll tell you about how I was introduced into learning about violet ray.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.480]   It's a very interesting story.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:32.440]   When I came across the Lukowski machine, that same friend who told me about that machine,
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:42.080]   he told me about this doctor in New Zealand that was really, well, I wouldn't say famous,
[00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:46.680]   but he'd already taken himself off the register because the authorities had tried to call
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:51.240]   him a quack, you know, so that piqued my interest.
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:56.240]   And he had a six month waiting list, right?
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.640]   And that's why he was so well regarded, he had six month waiting list.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.800]   So I just called him up and I put myself on the waiting list and I didn't have anything
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:06.520]   particularly wrong with me.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:11.000]   And six months passed and the receptionist made my appointment and I had to do three
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.760]   sessions within two weeks.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.960]   That was their protocol.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:20.160]   And he was a spinal specialist and he was a general medicine practitioner and acupuncturist
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.920]   and naturopath in an osteopath.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:26.760]   And I didn't know what to expect when I walked into his clinic.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:34.960]   The appointment was about 25 minutes long and he just asked me a few questions and then
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:40.680]   with the osteopathic method, he just traced his fingers down either side of my spine to
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:48.000]   feel the electromagnetic situation of my spinal nerve roots.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.760]   And then he traced his fingers down, he's like, "Okay, you've got a block here, you've
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.200]   got a block here, you've got a block here."
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:57.200]   He showed me a spinal nerve chart and shows me, "Okay, because you've got a block here,
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:02.840]   that means the energy from that nerve that goes into this organ is blocked, therefore
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:06.560]   that organ energy is low in voltage.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:12.020]   So you're going to have this kind of symptom, like a digestive symptom or whatever."
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.480]   And I was like, "Oh yes, you're very correct."
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:18.680]   And so then after that he got me to sit in the chair and he ran the violet ray down either
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.760]   side of my spine.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:26.120]   And then we went into another room and he lays me down face down on a table and he puts these
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.280]   things on the blocked nerve roots.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:35.400]   And the whole time that took was about eight minutes and then I was done.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:41.520]   And then I left and when I got home I felt a little bit tired so I sat down, I felt a
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:46.920]   bit sleepy so I laid down and then I woke up four hours later and I completely conked
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.400]   out like a reset.
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:55.040]   And then the next time I went to see him probably three or four days later he assessed my spine
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.720]   again with the osteopathic technique.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:06.680]   And he was like, "Oh, you've got a bone out and your cervical vertebra C4C5."
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:14.520]   And then he basically shoved the bone back into place with the osteopathic thumb, like
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:20.120]   funk, I was like, "Whoa, it was quite, you know, wow."
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.760]   And then we repeated the treatment with the violet ray and then the lying down and doing
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:29.760]   what I believe was post-magnet therapy, he wouldn't tell me.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:36.040]   And then basically for the next few days and continued into weeks and months after that
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:41.800]   second session I felt like I'd been given 14 years back on my clock.
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:43.040]   I was full of energy.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.040]   I didn't need to eat.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.040]   I didn't need to sleep.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:50.520]   I was running around like so happy just telling everyone, "I'm just living on electricity.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:51.520]   We don't need food.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.520]   We're just electricity.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.960]   Running around like this."
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:01.080]   And you know, what he'd done on my cervical vertebra number four-five is, you know, he
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:06.960]   said that the nerve coming out of that area feeds into your thyroid and your thyroid is
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.720]   responsible for your immune system hormones and if that had not been corrected in the
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:14.840]   future, you would have developed cancer.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:21.000]   And I realized that a couple of years before that, three years before that, I totally forgotten
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.760]   about this and many people do forget about these things, was that I'd been hit by a car
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:30.600]   and my head hit the windscreen and smashed the whole windscreen and I popped off the
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:36.720]   other side and I landed on my feet like a cat and I was absolutely fine, ambulance checked
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:42.280]   me out, I was not concussed, nothing happened except I got a twisted ankle and then the
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:49.480]   next few days I got a bit of a ryanex so we treated that with gwasha which was fine.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:55.360]   But then, you know, years on, I actually had a twisted vertebra which was blocking my nerve
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:00.280]   electrical supply to my organs and that was causing my immune system to get less and less
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:05.760]   and less which meant I was getting tired and aging and once the structure was put back
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:12.080]   into place which was my spine and then once the structure was in alignment, then pulse
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:17.280]   magnet therapy could be pumped down the spinal nerve which then reached the organ that was
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.720]   connected to which boosted the organ with energy.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.120]   So you had to unblock before you could charge up?
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:28.960]   Yeah, I mean, you're not going to force the electricity down and bent wire.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:29.960]   Right, right.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.520]   Or your water through a bent guard nose.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.640]   That makes so much sense.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.920]   So you know, I got a question.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:42.920]   Is anything that you've described, you know, because people can go out and buy some of
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:49.920]   these devices and you know, and like in the case of the Violet Ray, you know, the only
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:55.880]   ones you can get are the restored ones in pre-1941 because the AMA kind of shut them down.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:00.040]   But, you know, they are out there and there's plenty of them, you can always get one and
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:04.080]   get it refurbished by an electrical engineer and make it brand new again, even though it's
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.320]   like, you know, almost 100 years old.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:11.360]   But you know, like, what do you recommend for people that can, you know, try to do it
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:19.320]   at home or do it themselves who own multi-wave oscillators or own PMF devices and or Violet
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.320]   Ray devices and things like that?
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.720]   Do you have like any questions?
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:31.760]   Something I would say with that treatment I just described on my spine, yeah, ever, ever
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:32.760]   try and do that yourself.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:33.760]   Yeah, I can.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:39.720]   I tried to do that myself and I missed my back up so badly.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:45.720]   I would say, aren't there, wouldn't there be like yoga poses that you could do to realign
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:51.920]   your back if you had like a back injury or a realign your pelvis, you know, doing yoga
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:52.920]   or stretch?
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.920]   Of course.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:59.720]   You can do to get your structures in alignment, but what I'm saying with that procedure of
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:04.640]   doing the Violet Ray down the spinal nerves and then applying the pulse magnets afterwards,
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.360]   it has to be done by someone else because your body has to be in the right position.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.360]   Okay.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:15.720]   One example after I'd had that, you know, that treatment by that specialist and then
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.560]   I was like, I said, can you teach me your ways?
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:23.080]   He's like, oh, I'm going to patient it maybe in a couple of years and I was like, no, that's
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.080]   too slow.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.800]   I need to do this now.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:30.440]   So I ended up making friends with this engineer and he built my first pulse magnet machine
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:37.060]   for me in him as our project, which we're still working on developing.
[00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:41.640]   But once I got hold of that and I got a hold of a Violet Ray, I thought, right, I'm going
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:45.800]   to do this myself and I sat on my treatment table and I did the Violet Ray on the top half
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:52.080]   of my spinal nerve roots and then I sort of twisted around and I got it on my back and
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:57.360]   then I was sitting up and then I slung the pulse magnet coils over my shoulders and I
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:03.160]   sat upright and I pulsed myself for a little bit just because I like to be able to do things
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:06.400]   myself and on my own experiment.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:12.000]   And then the next day my whole back went into spasm and it was excruciating.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.400]   And luckily I'd had my third appointment booked.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.760]   No, that was my fourth appointment actually booked with the spinal specialist and I got
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:24.440]   into his clinic in severe pain and he's like, "What have you done?"
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:31.720]   And you know, luckily it was complete spasm of the spinal muscles and this is a good thing
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.960]   about the Violet Ray actually.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:37.840]   You do the Violet Ray on that situation and it relieves it.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:43.320]   So you know, it was easily fixable but I caused that problem myself through my own experiment.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:47.520]   I would definitely suggest to all, you have to be in the right position, you have to make
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:52.080]   sure that your spine is elongated, you don't want to have any twists because after you
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:57.920]   have that kind of spinal nerve activation done, the recommendation from that particular
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:04.760]   person, he was like, "Do not do any twisting yoga in the next week because you can cause
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:06.840]   a muscle spasm.
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:13.520]   Do not go in freezing cold water because you can cause a muscle contraction and spasm
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.520]   and nerve impingement."
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:23.520]   So the certain things you do, so you don't overstimulate yourself and mess up your structures.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:27.640]   So, you know, I just got a question for you.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:30.200]   Are you familiar with CNR technology?
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:35.840]   Yeah, I had well in but I haven't played around with it enough and I left it in New Zealand
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.080]   with my engineer friend.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:42.960]   Yeah, because you know what's really amazing is as I was reading all the Edgar Casey prescriptions
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:48.240]   of using violet ray that he'd tell the patient to do this or that, that it really maps over
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:54.280]   to that, like I was saying earlier, the teachings of Dr. Jerry Tennant and how he tells or how
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:51:02.640]   he teaches his practitioners to use his version of the CNR, which is called the biomodulator.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:06.680]   And it comes along with another device, it's a scalar device called the transducer.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:11.760]   So I see that as like the next evolution or the next generation of the violet rays, you
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:17.320]   know, is the CNR technology because it does, the modalities are almost the same as like
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:21.480]   do this and as if you would, if you had a violet ray in your hand, you'd be doing the
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:24.440]   same thing with an electrode off of a CNR kind of thing.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:28.960]   So it is pretty amazing that there's like a newer, more, you know, advanced technology
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:34.700]   version of this, but you're right, it is very, very difficult and to do by yourself physically
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:38.560]   at a let alone, you know, precarious if you were to do it the wrong way.
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:43.800]   But yeah, if you ever get a chance, I would definitely, I know you're familiar with Tennant,
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:47.320]   but I don't have any of his devices.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.800]   No, I don't.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:55.280]   Basically I've got a multi-wave oscillator, a violet ray, and a couple of different post-electro
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:52:03.160]   magnetic field therapy machines that my engineer made for us in New Zealand.
[00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:07.760]   And our first prototype, I think we've got about 30 different frequency patterns in
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.760]   there.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:15.880]   And then the second prototype is actually at a friend's house, up the road.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.440]   And then the third prototype is our one that we're trying to produce for public sale,
[00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.680]   which is like a miniaturized version.
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:26.180]   And that's got three different frequency settings on it.
[00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:33.560]   And we've actually got the coils, we asked Robert Dennis from ISIS, if we could borrow
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:37.760]   use his coil design for our prototype.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.240]   You're familiar with Robert Dennis?
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:43.120]   No, I haven't heard his name before.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:50.560]   So he's developed post-magnet therapy when he was working for NASA.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:52.360]   Okay.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:57.880]   And yeah, he's really inspirational because the machines he developed for public sale,
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:02.280]   he's got the lowest price he can put on them so he can give the gift to as many people
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.840]   as possible.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:08.520]   So you can pick up one of his machines for about $469 US dollars.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:09.520]   Oh.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.520]   Which is?
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.520]   What's his name?
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.520]   Sorry.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:13.520]   ICES.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.520]   ICES PMN.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.520]   His name's Robert Dennis.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:23.960]   He does a lot of really interesting interviews and things.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:24.960]   Okay.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.160]   And he's called because he came into it all as a skeptic, because I think in his story
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:33.960]   he said that NASA said, can you develop a post-magnet therapy for therapeutic usage?
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.960]   And he's like, I don't know if it's going to do anything.
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:41.280]   And he made it and it worked and now he makes some therapy.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:48.760]   In fact, you know what's interesting about biological magnetics as a healing art is
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:56.880]   that the FDA, I love them or hate them, but they've actually endorsed, they've actually
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:03.200]   approved PMF as a therapeutic modality as well as the CNR.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:08.520]   So like the tenant bio-modulator as an FDA-approved device, it falls under the category of a TENS
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:15.480]   device, but it's something that there's no problem at all using.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:20.640]   So that's kind of refreshing that there are some devices out there that are still out
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:25.960]   and not accepted by the mainstream science.
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:32.520]   But then again, the violet ray, as you may know, was deemed quackery back in the 1940s
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:37.600]   and it's no surprise to me that you're actually using it and it works.
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:45.120]   So I really love this idea of unblock, realign and restore and your description of this
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.280]   woman with problems walking.
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:55.480]   I'm wondering, is that a typical situation you have with clients that come in and they're
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:55:01.480]   just very blocked and they're unaligned and then it's just a matter of using bio-electrics
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:07.840]   right to kind of activate their cells, hands-on to kind of move things around and realign
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:12.880]   them and then put that energy back in them and then the success stories just pile onto
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:13.880]   themselves?
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:19.600]   Obviously, I mean, I just was fascinating that this is obviously successful and it works
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.600]   really well.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:21.840]   You've been doing it for years.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:29.520]   Yeah, well, it's essentially a really simple protocol that I apply to any problem and it
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:30.520]   works.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.560]   So person comes in and they can't feel their feet.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.560]   I do that.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.480]   Person comes in with a digestive complaint.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:36.480]   I do that.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.480]   Person.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:46.200]   You know, the only variable on this protocol would probably be like spiritual issues or
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:53.760]   emotional mental stuff where I would go into then helping the person explore through their
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:56:02.400]   own observation of their physical body sensations, observing the feelings that they find and
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:06.960]   then unpacking, you know, where is it in your body?
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:11.400]   Where can you feel this painful feeling or this blockage or whatever?
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.560]   Okay, you've located it.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:13.560]   Okay.
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:17.360]   So about that place in your body, is it at the skin surface or is it deeper down?
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.360]   Is it in the muscle?
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:20.880]   Does it feel closer to the organ of the bone?
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:22.880]   Okay, you found out where it is.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.680]   Can you feel how big it is?
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:33.240]   Is it the size of a grape, a tennis ball, a golf ball, you know, describe it?
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:34.840]   Does it have a color?
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:40.560]   And so while you're bringing someone's consciousness into their own body through the self observation,
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:47.960]   through the actual pointing of their awareness, you're creating a electromagnetic field inside
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:48.960]   those cells.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:49.960]   Right.
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:50.960]   Right.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:55.720]   And then as that has been applied through their awareness, it starts changing.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:58.080]   And I'm like, okay, so what color is it?
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.080]   Oh, it's blue.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.080]   Okay.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.080]   Does that have a personality?
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.080]   Oh my God.
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:06.020]   Oh, what's the personality?
[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:07.880]   It's like, it's like going like this to me.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.480]   It doesn't want to talk to me.
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:13.720]   Oh, so it sounds like maybe it feels a bit ignored.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:19.040]   And you need to really make friends with this consciousness inside your body and maybe
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:22.560]   start kind of bringing it back to you.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:23.840]   And what color is it now?
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:28.360]   Oh, it's kind of like a little bit blue, but a little bit more white.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:36.960]   And so as we do this and we extrapolate the observations through size and color and personality
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:41.500]   and things like this, the energy starts changing and it starts unwinding itself and
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:45.640]   it starts flicking off to different areas of the body as the body kind of discharges
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:50.920]   the energy, which has been blocked and held by the emotional energy for so long.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:59.600]   So that's part of it too, very much because most things like, you know, they say cancer
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:04.400]   is always emotionally created and it takes about 20 years to filter down from the emotional
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:10.880]   field into the physical body, and then once that's happened, you get cancer, unless it's,
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:16.120]   you know, from a toxin or a broken bone or something physically misaligned.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:21.160]   But you know, there's all these other different things we need to take into account when we're
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:27.800]   looking into our human bodies because we help memories and ourselves and our tissues and
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:34.440]   if we don't unlock the root of why that memory has been housed, then we can't release it.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:44.800]   Yeah, if you're interested, Tenet has a tutorial on how to release emotions using, well there's
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:50.240]   two different techniques, but you know, same concept, releasing the, because what in his
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:57.400]   world or in that world, it's like emotions create a, because they're physical and they
[00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:01.640]   create it, they have their own electrical field, electrical magnetic field and they get trapped
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:06.220]   in these fields and they become part of your body, your physical body, and then there's
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:11.640]   a way to relieve that and to address it and relieve it and then there's also the concept
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:13.000]   of the German new medicine.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:17.320]   That's another modality called, you know, German new medicine, and it's the same, I forgot
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:22.880]   what doctor figured that one out, but his entire philosophy is the same as that, which
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:32.280]   is emotions trap in your body and that they cause disease and ailments and problems and
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.280]   blockages, right?
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:37.280]   And so if you need to release, you can't just treat a patient, the physical patient, you
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:41.480]   need to treat the emotions because the emotions hold on to that problem.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:46.040]   It's real amazing when you start looking into these different scientists who've actually
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:52.000]   got this tremendous body of work and case studies that validate everything you just said.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   So it's amazing.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.520]   It's great to hear that it's actually in practice and it's helping people and that's
[00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:58.520]   really cool.
[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.120]   Oh, it's really amazing.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:08.680]   I had a client months ago that we discovered in, in his field, there was something that
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:15.240]   was related not to his father or his grandfather, but his great grandfather and it was to do
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:24.520]   around like, yeah, love and also not, he said he didn't have enough space in his body.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:29.880]   He felt like he didn't have enough space to be himself, which was quite intriguing to
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:30.880]   me.
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.120]   It's like, okay, if you don't have enough space inside your body, then who's in there with
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.120]   you?
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:36.120]   Right.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.120]   Taken up.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:44.000]   So we went into his lineage and then I was like, okay, when is it your father's problem?
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   Is it your grandfather?
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   Is it your great grandfather?
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   Yes.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   Okay.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   Great grandfather era.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   Okay.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   I'm thinking war.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.600]   Did your great grandfather kill anyone in the war?
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.600]   Yes.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.880]   Let's bring up all of the souls that he killed.
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:57.880]   All right.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:01.720]   Now we're going to clear them all from your field and as we cleared them out, I could
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:09.080]   literally hear all those souls saying, thank you, thank you as they left, like they were
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.400]   all stuck in his body from his lineage.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:18.800]   And then the next week, he came back to me and he reported the most amazing effect on
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.480]   his life because of that clearing.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.480]   It's amazing.
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.440]   So you never know what you're going to find.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.440]   That's amazing.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.440]   I do have a question for you.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:37.140]   I'm just kind of going down the, you know, for people who just don't have the money, you
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:43.260]   know, to buy the devices or even pay for treatments, do you have any words of wisdom?
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.500]   Like how can people self help?
[01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:49.180]   You know, because not everyone's, you know, because owning a multi-wave oscillator is
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.180]   very, very rare.
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:56.380]   Owning a, you know, owning PMF devices is, is most kind of doable for most people.
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:02:02.500]   But so, and even seen ours, like what I described as a biomodulator, very difficult to afford
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.300]   average human.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:09.580]   So do you have words of wisdom for people who can do, you know, what else could they
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:16.300]   do to better their health along the same concepts of unblock, realign, and restore?
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:19.980]   You know, who don't have money to do it.
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:24.860]   If you go on my channel, I don't have many YouTube videos on there, but one that I've
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:30.900]   called how I cleared my thyroid in under 10 minutes.
[01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:38.500]   And you know, before I got that post-magnet therapy done on my spine and the doctors shoved
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:46.220]   my bone back in with the osteopathic technique, years before that happened, I was in my final
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:49.780]   year of my degree of Chinese medicine.
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:54.100]   And it was the year after I'd had the car accident, right?
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:59.340]   So I started paying this lump on my thyroid and no one could really see it.
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:04.680]   I could feel it when I swallowed and no one could see it except one teacher because she'd
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.140]   had a thyroidectomy.
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:10.100]   So she was thyroid paranoid and she looked at my neck and she was like, "There's something
[01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:11.100]   up with your thyroid.
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:12.900]   I want you to get it checked out."
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:15.540]   And I said to her, "Look, I'm in my final year of my degree.
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:16.740]   I'm way too busy.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:20.420]   I will get it checked out or I will take care of it.
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:21.420]   Don't worry about me.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:22.420]   I'll take care of it."
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:24.380]   And I was doing a lot of meditation at the time.
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:29.460]   I'd just done my first Vipassana course, which is free, so I can recommend that to people
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:32.900]   and roll in Vipassana because it's free.
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:38.580]   And yeah, so Vipassana, you do 10 days in silent meditation and all you do is observe
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:41.380]   your bodily sensations.
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:48.740]   And in that 10 days of Vipassana, I literally had a chance to unwind my whole body and I'd
[01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:50.740]   never felt better in my entire life.
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:55.500]   And I've got a video on that channel a little bit describing that too.
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.980]   So what is that called?
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:57.980]   Anyway.
[01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:58.980]   It's called that video.
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:01.180]   I think it's how I unwind.
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:07.860]   Yeah, I got the, I saw the how I cleared my thyroid, but I guess, I'm not sure what the
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:09.780]   word is, the, you said, "Pornet."
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:15.700]   Oh, I had a prayer in your body and how I unwound my feet.
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:17.700]   Yeah, there's the two on the right.
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:18.700]   Right.
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:23.820]   So it's unique, you were talking about in terms of pronestia or I just want to make
[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:29.020]   sure everyone, how do you spell that just so that people can look it up?
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.020]   Vipassana?
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:35.020]   Yeah, I don't know how to spell.
[01:04:35.020 --> 01:04:36.020]   V-I.
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.020]   Oh.
[01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.020]   V-I-P-A.
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.020]   V-I-P-A-S-S-A-N-A.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:40.020]   There it is.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.020]   Okay.
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:50.100]   So it's, oh, Vip-Vip-N-S-S-S-A-N-A.
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:51.100]   Vipassana.
[01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:52.100]   Okay.
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:53.100]   All right.
[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:54.660]   So that's it right there.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:59.540]   And it's just doing this meditation, getting in touch with your body will help the whole
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:03.580]   unblocking and then realigning and restoring.
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:09.180]   It could be as simple as unblocking using meditation, is this, just correct me if I'm
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.180]   wrong.
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:13.900]   You're aligning using maybe yoga, stretching, exercising, and restoring.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:17.980]   I would think that just grounding, I know that if you ground, there's tremendous body
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:24.860]   of knowledge on the concept of earthing/grounding where you can pull electrons right out of the
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:30.140]   earth by putting your feet on grass and, or grounding through your house.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:34.940]   You just have to take a look at some of the many YouTube videos about it, but doing that
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:37.540]   pulls in those electrons to recharge you.
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:40.900]   Did you think that would be a good way to do it for people who can't afford it?
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:41.900]   Just meditation.
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:42.900]   Yes.
[01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:50.060]   I mean, the beauty of, yeah, Vipassana doesn't involve any yoga or stretching.
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:51.060]   Right.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.060]   It's purely meditation.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.060]   Right.
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:57.780]   So it'd be like, and they're very, they're procedures like you come for Vipassana and
[01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:58.780]   you do Vipassana.
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:04.140]   You don't do qigong, you don't do yoga, you don't do mantras to gurus, you leave all your
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:08.700]   crystals at home, you don't write your journal, like you're just doing this.
[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:13.820]   So you're essentially swapping your full-time job hours for doing meditation, and it's,
[01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:19.180]   it's hard work, but it's really worth the result.
[01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:26.620]   I've done it four times in different ways, and you have to do it for 10 days.
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:30.860]   So you have to be able to put aside 10 days that you don't have to go to work.
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:31.860]   Wow.
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:37.740]   And the beauty of it is, like for me, because I did it in the time where I was in the final
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:38.740]   year of a degree.
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:46.220]   So I was very mental, mentally based, and I, I got to this retreat and I was like, you
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:47.860]   mean you're going to feed me?
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:51.620]   And I don't have to talk to anyone for 10 days, amazing.
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:57.500]   Well, I have to do is look at people's shoes and ignore them.
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.620]   I'm down with that, you know?
[01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:02.780]   But I've been, you know, doing, doing all this clinic.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:06.220]   So I was always taking one other people's information and all of their problems.
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:08.460]   So it was time for me to restore myself.
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:09.460]   Okay.
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:10.660]   So that was very restorative.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:11.660]   Right.
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:14.540]   And yeah, they just give you a chance.
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:20.420]   Like when do you get a chance in your life to dedicate 10 full days straight to investigating
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:21.820]   how your body works?
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:26.860]   I wouldn't even know what 10 minutes is like, oh no, it's like, it's like, yeah, that should
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:27.860]   go.
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:28.860]   Yeah.
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:30.580]   It's all run on a therapy basis.
[01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:34.900]   So once you've finished a course, then they will allow you to donate.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:38.860]   And if you can't afford to donate, you can volunteer your time to go and work in the
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:42.540]   kitchen for the next person's course, which is what I did because I was a student and
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:43.700]   I had no money.
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:44.700]   That's great.
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:45.700]   So yep.
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:50.180]   No, I, because I, I just want to, I think the, the best thing that anyone can take away
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:57.180]   from our chat is this concept of unblock, realign, restore, and a way to do it on your
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:02.500]   own, a way to do it if you were to run into someone like yourself in their local community.
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:09.300]   You know, and then if you do have bio electrical devices, then, you know, these are the ways
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:13.340]   to use them in that concept of unblock, realign and restore.
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.340]   So thank you.
[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:17.020]   That's just awesome to hear.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.180]   If you don't mind, I do have a question.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:24.780]   It's a personal question because I have a couple friends and both of their wives have
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:26.900]   almost the same problem.
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.220]   And I'm just wondering what your thoughts are.
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:37.600]   They both have extremely difficult digestive systems by which they almost can't eat anything.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.900]   It's not fibromyalgia.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:41.980]   It's not any of these other things that, you know, they've been, you know, of course,
[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:46.980]   the American Medical Association doctors have been just torturing the hell out of them,
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:47.980]   right?
[01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:48.980]   You know what?
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:52.740]   But it's the whole idea of just, you know, what, you know, what I asked both of them.
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:57.700]   I said, you know, have your wives ever, you know, had antibiotics in the past or been
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.280]   through a long bout of antibiotics?
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.780]   And both of them said, yes.
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:05.840]   And I was thinking that, you know, that they basically wiped out their gut microbiome.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.160]   And but what you're talking about, the cold pelvis, you know, it really kind of like,
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.140]   oh, that's a different, you know, so I'm just like wondering, like, what would you, what
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.140]   would you try to do?
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:21.500]   What would you try to suggest to these women who, who are basically capable because they,
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:27.820]   they just really have such a limited ability of foods to eat because they can't, you know,
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:32.180]   they're literally, you know, allergic, not allergic necessarily, but they don't, you
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:37.100]   know, they're not, they can't eat in 90% of the foods, the rest of us can.
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:42.900]   And it's, and their gut is just completely messed up and I think I linked that to antibiotics.
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:45.140]   But then again, there's a lot of different ways you can mess it up.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:47.620]   So how would you approach that?
[01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:52.780]   Yeah, well, it's, it's always a bit multifaceted when it comes to gut stuff because those
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:57.660]   are like big hollow tubes and there's a lot of places where things can live, like parasites.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:02.500]   And then there's the microbiome, which has to be at the right, you know, balance.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:09.940]   And then there's the pH, then there's heavy metals, which block cellular nutrient absorption.
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:13.620]   Then there's temperature, like, as I spoke about the pelvis.
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:17.460]   So literally if you get your hand and take the back of your hand and touch it to your
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:20.500]   glutes, do you have a cold ass?
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:24.900]   And if you have a cold ass, then you've probably got a cold front of your pelvis, which means
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:29.060]   that you've got cold in your intestines.
[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:34.180]   So cold pain usually feels like a contraction in the spasoming and like, like when you stand
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:39.260]   in the wind and the cold wind and your body is trying to brace itself against that cold
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.820]   wind, you start contracting.
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.740]   So imagine your organs doing that.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:44.620]   So you have to look into the diet.
[01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:47.740]   What are they putting in to get that kind of reaction?
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:50.100]   Are they putting in cold food and cold drinks?
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.780]   Eliminate that.
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.620]   Have they had heavy metal overload?
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:55.860]   So you've got to check out the amalgams and the teeth.
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:58.340]   You've got to check out vaccinations.
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:11:03.020]   If they've had either of those, then they've probably got some heavy metals in there that
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.900]   block cellular nutrient absorption.
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:10.500]   And that load the cells with, you know, nano and all of the stuff stuck to the blood cells
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:16.940]   and there's all these foreign bodies that need to be out.
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:21.420]   And then there's a glow of phosphates on all of the processed food that is basically
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:28.940]   like, that's why people have IBS and all of that kind of digestive classifications because
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:33.780]   it's just a reaction to toxins on the chemical sprays that they put on the foods that we're
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:35.900]   ingesting.
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.260]   So that to me is all considered blockages.
[01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:44.660]   So you need to get out the blockages and then restore the ingredients or align the right
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:46.920]   body temperature if they do have cold.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:47.920]   Maybe they've got too much heat.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.380]   I don't know what their age is.
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:53.260]   If you're at the menopausal age, you're going into more of a heat cycle.
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:56.500]   So the yin and yang is imbalanced as well.
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:57.500]   There's dehydration.
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:03.060]   If you're not absorbing the water properly because of toxins in the water, your body
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:07.260]   will reject the water.
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:11.940]   And then self-treatment wise, you can do a lot of abdominal massage in moving the lymphatic
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:16.860]   system and using castor oil and castor oil packs.
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:22.620]   You can actually help the lymphatic system to detox and get all those blockages out through
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:27.340]   using a castor oil pack, which is also anti-cancer.
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:34.660]   So castor oil pack is essentially when you get a big piece of organic wool or cotton
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:39.940]   unbleached fabric and you soak it in castor oil and you put it on your entire abdomen
[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:44.460]   where your organs are and then you put some plastic over the top to trap the heat and
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:49.540]   you use a hot water bottle on top and that a hot water bottle will help the castor oil
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:55.860]   penetrate into your body and that will start breaking up adhesions, which are organs stuck
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:13:02.460]   for organs, or tissues stuck to tissues or inflammation that will help to reduce inflammation
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.100]   and things like that.
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:09.460]   And then for females as well, and these ladies case, maybe they've had babies, maybe they've
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:10.460]   had c-sections.
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:15.420]   If they've had c-sections, their whole of muscles will be cut and they don't have circulation
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:16.420]   to their organs.
[01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:24.460]   So they have to get scar therapy on the c-section, which you can use castor oil for and acupuncture
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:26.700]   and different things like that.
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:33.980]   And also maybe internally if they've got IUDs or if they've been using any kind of female
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:40.500]   sanitary items that have genetically modified cottons or anything like that that can introduce
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.700]   toxins into the body.
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:48.500]   So you can see it's, you know, and then also, you know, how's their low back and how's their
[01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:53.420]   middle back because the nerves that run out of their spine go into the digestive organs.
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:57.660]   So maybe they had a car crash 20 years ago and this binds out of place, like me with my
[01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:05.300]   twisted neck, or yeah, maybe the pelvis is out of place, which then pulls on the internal
[01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:11.380]   organs and then blocks up the flow of the energy because something's been squeezed inside
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.780]   the body.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:21.420]   Yeah, it's kind of, you know, stuffed it and investigate and then rule out.
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:26.900]   Okay, and it takes a bit of time.
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:27.900]   Yeah.
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:34.380]   Definitely like your suggestion of the antibiotics, if they haven't cleared all of that toxins
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:41.940]   out and then restored the natural microbiome, then that's definitely going to be part of
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:42.940]   it.
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:47.620]   Yeah, I've actually been looking into the actual symptoms of, of indigestion, it's like when
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:53.140]   I eat something, do I feel sick, when I eat something, do I throw it up or do I get intestinal
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:58.460]   cramping or do I get immediate diarrhea or constipation, like there's different symptoms
[01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:01.900]   which would lead us to different organs to focus on.
[01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.900]   That's really, really helpful.
[01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:09.300]   Yeah, I've read, I've read that some specific antibiotics will destroy certain bacteriums
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.500]   in the gut.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:14.620]   They could take up to two years to be restored, you know, naturally, if they're not taking
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:15.620]   probiotics.
[01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:20.180]   So, I avoid, I avoid anything that messes with my biome.
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:26.420]   You know, I just, I will not do anything to mess with my, my happy little gut biome because
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:31.580]   I finally got it after years and got it to be super happy and healthy and we're in love
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:34.100]   with each other and I take good care of that bacteria.
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:35.540]   I will not mess with it.
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:40.920]   I feed it every day with three biotics, I supplement it with probiotics, you know, I'm always drinking
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:46.480]   kombucha, I mean, yeah, it's, I've learned over time that your gut microbiome is the
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:51.280]   key to your health next to your, your energy field, you know, I mean, it's so important
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:54.760]   because we're both right, we're both energy and we're also physical meat tax.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:16:00.040]   Yeah, I'm just going to move around because it's been a storm here and you're breaking
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.040]   up a little bit.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.040]   Can you hear me?
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:08.960]   So, a question though, you know, like I'm wondering, is, is, is eczema related to gut
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:15.840]   health in your, in your belief system or in your, you know, what you've learned because
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:21.600]   the one of the two wives has severe eczema and, and I'm just wondering, you know, is that
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:25.320]   a gut health issue or is that an energy issue?
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:29.840]   I'm, it can be both.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:36.240]   So if you imagine where your internal organs are, like your digestive system, which is one
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:40.880]   side, you know, under your right hand, you've got your liver and then your gallbladder.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:45.320]   That's a digestive organ and you've got your stomach in the middle, you're spline off to
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:48.320]   the other side, your pancreas over the top and then over the top of all that, you've
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.440]   got your small intestine and your large intestine.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:54.000]   So that's your digestive organs is quite a lot.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   Okay.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.120]   So the liver's job is to detox the body from toxins, right?
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.120]   Right.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:10.000]   When the liver is overloaded with a toxic job or it's, it's got too many jobs to do and
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.640]   it's trying to discharge all the toxins.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:15.740]   It's meant to go through the digestive system, but sometimes the liver has to push it out
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:22.720]   in other ways and it will push it out through the skin, yeah, it'll push it out through
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.720]   the skin.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.680]   So a lot of these, you know, skin conditions are just the liver trying to get rid of the
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:28.680]   toxins.
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:34.640]   Then in Chinese medicine, when we investigate the emotions of all the organs, every organ
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:40.880]   gets a different emotion, the liver's emotions are frustration and anger.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.480]   So if there's any kind of frustration and anger going on and it can't be like released
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:51.240]   or expressed, then that's going to block up the liver's ability to have free movement,
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:57.840]   which can cause, you know, funny reactions, also for women because the liver is involved
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.840]   with the blood and periods.
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:08.880]   As we lose blood every month through our period, the liver is involved with basically storing
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:14.560]   the blood and if there's not enough blood generated from what we produce from the food
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:20.480]   intake, the liver has, it would, it kind of dries out like a dry sponge.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:26.520]   It should be a wet sponge full of blood and if it's too dry and it can't deliver enough
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:34.280]   blood to the rest of the body, then it will, you'd generate this kind of stagnant energy
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:41.200]   and that is seen in pissed offness, PNS, just frustration and anger, things like that.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:46.600]   So that emotion component can then attack the digestive system and then we get it like
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:50.200]   a repeating cycle.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:57.040]   So you know, it's kind of, was it the emotions first or was it the ingredients first or was
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:03.280]   it the toxins first, but then they all kind of interreact in a cycle after a while and
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:07.560]   then as you said that they've had the antibiotics, then that's probably an introduction of a
[01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:12.280]   toxin and then the liver's just overloaded and it's got too many jobs to do and it never
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.520]   gets a rest and then it's just like pissed off and was trying to send all the stuff
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.840]   out through the skin and then that pisses the person off because they feel like the
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:28.640]   skin's not pretty and then that makes them sad and so it can go on and like that.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:33.720]   And then obviously vitamin D, that will really help the skin get the nutrients and we need
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:40.320]   cholesterol and dietary fats as precursors to make the right hormones for the body.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:47.680]   So if there's been dieting going on and people are on all sorts of crazy diets, especially
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:55.360]   in Bali, everyone's fasting every 20 seconds but they're starving themselves.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:03.440]   So you know, I saw one person list on Facebook, I'm fasting and I'm avoiding fats and other
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:07.320]   mucous forming foods and I'm like, hang on a minute, fats aren't mucous forming foods,
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.840]   fats are a necessary ingredients to make hormones.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:14.120]   It's like if it goes in your body and you're in transmissions.
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.280]   Your liver's made.
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.640]   You kind of need it.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:17.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:23.360]   There's a lot of wrong nations being passed around with people that think they're both
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.360]   things.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.360]   Yeah.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:26.800]   Oh, thank you so much for the advice.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:31.040]   I really appreciate that and I'm just wondering, you know, as you know, it's been an hour.
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:35.400]   I want to be sensitive to your time but I just was wondering as a wrap up question, are
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.800]   there other electrobiological magnetic devices that you're looking into that you might consider
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:43.020]   adding to your practice?
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:50.160]   Well, at the moment, I'm still trying to, because my engineer friend is in New Zealand
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:56.720]   and we're still trying to get our magnet machine like I need to redesign the casing and all
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:57.720]   this sort of stuff.
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:03.280]   So I haven't been researching much into other devices.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:10.640]   What I am doing though is some experiments with the multiwave oscillator and some other
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:20.000]   devices which my friend and Bali uses, which is some technology designed by a man in Egypt.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.720]   And it's called light mandala.
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:30.360]   And my idea was I tried this out once last year with another friend with the same technology.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:37.680]   He just started up some experiments in the last month based on the fact that the multiwave
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:45.680]   oscillator will amplify whatever medicine you take while you're in the field.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:52.120]   And I got this information from the person I bought the machine from because he said that
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:58.400]   he sold one to a doctor over in America and the doctor liked to come home after work and
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:01.760]   have a glass of whiskey after his day at work, right?
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:05.480]   And one day he just got his machine and he said, "I'll have the glass of whiskey while
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:07.280]   I'm in the machine."
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:17.680]   And he worked at the floor four hours later, so got me thinking about it, yeah, well, time
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:24.280]   and space, scalar fields and all that, but I really got me thinking, I'm like, "Okay,
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:28.360]   if that does something with that kind of medicine, then what can we do with other kinds
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.360]   of medicine?"
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:35.960]   So I did an experiment in New Zealand using homeopathy and that was pretty interesting.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:39.240]   My friend was a homeopath.
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:45.680]   She gave the clinical dose to our client who was a shared client and also a friend.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:51.520]   And he agreed to be doing this experiment with us where we put him in the multiwave oscillator
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.520]   only for 15 minutes.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:57.800]   And he took his drop of homeopathic dose and he meditated and we meditated in the same
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.800]   room altogether.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:07.240]   And then I recorded what he experienced afterwards and it was like recording a full trip report.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:13.600]   Like he went completely to somewhere else, like in a psychedelic space.
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:18.920]   And we had to ground him and feed him and everything that was quite full on.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.600]   So since I've been in Bali and I've met these friends with these other technologies, I'm
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:27.680]   like, "Oh, I want to experiment with that technology with the multiwave oscillator."
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:30.600]   And one of the machines, it's called light alchemy.
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:38.840]   And it's basically like a par light like what you'd use on a stage probably about centimeters
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:42.280]   in diameter and just like an angled light.
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:43.280]   And they use that light.
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:47.660]   It's capable of producing different colors and LEDs.
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:50.600]   And they've got that hooked up to their programs.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:55.660]   And there's a whole bunch of programs that it can run through with different elements.
[01:23:55.660 --> 01:24:01.920]   And each element has a different resonant frequency which matches a different color pattern.
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:09.400]   So we've started experimenting with using that by our resonance to read the person and
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:16.720]   then design their elemental program and then shine that light on the person inside the
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:23.840]   multiwave oscillator to see if we can amplify the effects of both technologies.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:30.160]   And so we've been doing that and taking photos and recording our testimonials afterwards.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:35.640]   And also the last one we just did, the same friends, he's got another bunch of friends
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:44.240]   that have a company making plasma, ingestible and topical plasma sprays that are using different
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:56.480]   elements like zinc and oxygen, I can't remember the ingredients, quite basic ingredients.
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:01.600]   And so the last one we did where we would ingest the plasma and then topically spray
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:09.040]   the plasma and then use the light and the multiwave oscillator just to see what kind of different
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.040]   effects we can get.
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:17.000]   So we can start making protocols around getting great results for people in a short space
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:23.760]   of time but without taking it too far.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:30.960]   Because the first friend, we put on that a couple of weeks ago, he hadn't really experienced
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:33.880]   any of this kind of technology before.
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:40.540]   And so I only gave him 10 minutes and he had to go to sleep directly afterwards for about
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:46.680]   half an hour because it was a lot, his system just needed to reboot straight away.
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:50.200]   So it's what I'm doing.
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:56.480]   I'm still exploring the current, the current machine's capabilities, you could say.
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:57.480]   That's amazing.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:02.480]   No, I just wish you well and, you know, we're way past an hour and I just, again, I just
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:08.180]   want to be respectful of your time and just wanted to, you know, like wrap this up.
[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:11.840]   You know, is there, so if people want to reach you, let's say they happen to be in
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:18.240]   your area and they, you know, they watch this video, then here's your, can I just, you know,
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:22.160]   you have a blog, you have a YouTube channel, but how do people contact you if they wanted
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.160]   to?
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.800]   Is it through your blog?
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:31.000]   Yeah, probably through, through my website, I've only just made this website.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.600]   I'm a bit slack on websitey things.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:34.600]   So here's the content.
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:35.600]   Okay.
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:36.600]   So here there is a contact.
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:37.600]   Okay.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:39.600]   What is it?
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:42.600]   So I should have.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:43.600]   Oh, here's your email.
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.600]   There you go.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.760]   But what that's really probably good too because I've been having a few problems with my, with
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:54.440]   my email, sometimes I don't get messages for some weird reason.
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.480]   So WhatsApp is much more direct.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:58.480]   Okay.
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.680]   And everyone has WhatsApp generally.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:04.240]   Do you have a, do you have a username on WhatsApp?
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:10.040]   What is my username on WhatsApp?
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.240]   Probably just my name, Anna Steele.
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.240]   Okay.
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:19.960]   Or is it come on a time weaver, but see something like that underneath the name, I think.
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:20.960]   Or my time weaver.
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:23.560]   Look at your own things, do you?
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:27.320]   And I do know that you do visit us for all of you who don't know.
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:32.080]   We do have an electrohealing chat group on telegram and that's where we met, Anna.
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:38.840]   So, and that's very fortunate that you jumped onto that chat group and, and here we are.
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:42.560]   So you know, is there anything else you wanted to share with us and then we'll just let you
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.560]   go?
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:44.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:49.760]   Well, I mean, if people do want to reach me, you know, even if they're not.
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:55.160]   And Bali, because no one's moving anywhere right at the moment with the world.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:01.200]   But yeah, I'm happy to, to do online sessions with, you know, moving the spiritual kind
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.200]   of blocks.
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:03.200]   Oh, okay.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:09.200]   I've done that remotely for people or working with them live and also teaching self-healing
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.920]   methods like how to do abdominal massage and how to do cast oil packs and how to get the
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:19.200]   cold out of your body, diet and lifestyle advice and assessments and recommendations
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:24.920]   can all be done through the, through the, you know, talking like this.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:25.920]   Okay.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:26.920]   That's great.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:32.160]   I'll tell you what, I'm going to put Anna's blog YouTube channel in the video description
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:33.960]   for anyone that wants to reach out.
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.240]   You do online session.
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:40.080]   So it's just a matter of just getting in touch with you and, and, and just going from there.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:41.080]   So that's awesome.
[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.040]   Well, thank you very much.
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:50.600]   And the process of making some videos and starting to get into doing some online videos
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:51.600]   and courses.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:57.160]   So over the next few months, I'll be hopefully getting those, you know, finished and out
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:58.160]   there.
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:03.460]   So I really want to be able to teach and the most basic terms I can explain how your body
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:12.200]   works and what goes, how to identify when it goes wrong and then how to fix it and doing
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:16.400]   it naturally and not necessarily needing any electromagnetic field devices, because we
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.440]   already are electromagnetic field devices, and we live on one of the biggest ones in
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:22.440]   our universe.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:28.320]   We just got to go outside and take off your shoes, which is something almost nobody does.
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.520]   You know, I live in a tropical island.
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:34.720]   So I ground every day on grass and I have that luxury.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.360]   So I'm sure you do too, right?
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.520]   Because you're right there in the tropics.
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:42.640]   Yeah, yeah, I'm in the jungly part of Bali.
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:50.280]   So right now, rainy season, so yeah, not quite as sunny as it was a few months ago.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.280]   All right.
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:55.640]   Well, I just want to say thank you for everyone for spending some time with me today.
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.520]   It's just been, oh, it's fascinating to hear you talk.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:02.920]   I have so many questions, but I don't want to interrupt.
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:03.920]   But thank you again.
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:04.920]   Thank you so much.
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:08.920]   And I really appreciate your time.
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:12.400]   Yeah, well, next time you have more questions, we'll have another chat.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:13.400]   All right.
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:14.400]   Arguesso Aloha.
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.400]   Aloha.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.400]   Thank you.
