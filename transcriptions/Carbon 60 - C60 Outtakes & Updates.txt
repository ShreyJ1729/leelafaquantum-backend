[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another carbon 60 video by me K Elmer and in this
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.100]   video I'd like to share with you my outtakes and updates for the C60 stuff
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.720]   and what I mean by outtakes is I do a lot of little mini projects that don't
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.560]   really warrant a whole video and I just decided to throw them all into this
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.880]   video so you can kind of see all little tiny things that I I think up and you
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.000]   know I just wanted to share with you and then there's also been some updates
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.360]   lately in the C60 industry that I thought were really interesting and I
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.680]   thought I'd share with those with you as well so hey you know basically the
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.720]   outtakes I did you know it during the stir versus on a cake video actually did
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.320]   an experiment and I completely forgot about putting it in the video so I
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.200]   actually did a bit I did the experiment was supposed to go in that video and I
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.440]   totally forgot I did it and you know I was actually done with the video and
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.800]   uploading it and I was like oh snap you know I forgot to put it in but so I'm
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.720]   going to show that with you I did this thing called the jar experiment I got
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.200]   the idea off a longevity I've been playing around with stir bars ever since
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.720]   that stir bar or I'm sorry the stir versus sonicate video I've been trying
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.600]   different stir bars trial and error came up with this idea for vacuum sealing and
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.600]   some different type of oil to use and then for updates live pet has produced a
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.920]   patent like to cover that that's fantastic news red line has published a
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.000]   new formula the third one now and you know it's their tinkerers like the rest
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.480]   of us and so they keep finding new ways to do things so I'm going to cover that
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.680]   new formula with you and then let's take a look at behind the scenes at C60 lab
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.560]   they were kind enough to send me some footage so you can actually see what a
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.320]   commercial lab looks like that's kind of cool so let's start off with the first
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.480]   one this this experiment was the one that went with that video and what I
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.240]   wanted to kind of show or actually figure out was like is there a difference is
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.960]   there any kind of difference that you could tell without fancy equipment and
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.840]   tons of money to you know it you know from the the result of the difference
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.800]   between stirring your C60 oil or sonicating your C60 oil so I didn't
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.480]   experiment just to see you know what what if there was a difference that I
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.960]   could detect and basically at two two liters they were both 80% MCT oil and when
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.640]   I use MCT I always use 100% caprylic acid and then of course 20% just regular
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.160]   coconut oil I'm adding the longer-changed triglycerides hoping that I could get
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.880]   higher saturation both liters had 1.25 grams of powdered C60 each that I just
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.320]   picked that number out of the air just you know part of the experiment and
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.800]   then now the first leader was your standard stir two weeks let it sit and
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.200]   filter right but the second leader which was a son of Kate leader was son of Kate
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.240]   for 40 minutes and this is before I knew about doing it for four minutes like
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.780]   Red Lion let us know in that video so I before that I was doing it around 40
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.640]   minutes so I was 40 minutes I settled for 10 and filtered and I timed it so
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.280]   that I would be filtering both of these on the same day so this is the the the
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.080]   result and and what it comes down to is the visual inspection of the bottom of
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.200]   the flask after I I removed the top portion this hole it was just where the
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.640]   stir bar was I forgot to take it out and you can see it's it's super thick I
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.160]   mean there's a you know because it's mostly MCT it's very very thick on the
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.560]   bottom and you can't see through the bottom so there's a ton of C60 residual
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.040]   which is what you would expect from MCT and stirring it but then here's the
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.360]   son of Kate one and look it's exactly the same I mean if anything you can kind
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.320]   of like you can see a little bit more light coming through the bottom but when
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.280]   you look at it like that it's just it seems to be a reflection so to me you
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.480]   know I'm just you know my personal opinion was that there was just as much
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:03.680]   residual C60 IE meaning there is just as much C60 that had saturated into the
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.040]   oil and then if you saw that video you noticed that all the colors were the
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.000]   same yeah it was all it was that same batch so both batches ended up having
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.400]   pretty much the same residual 60 C60 and the same end result color because here's
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.960]   what it looked like at the end of the day stir versus son of Kate this is your
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.320]   end product which one is which and the answer is is I don't remember I was two
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.520]   months ago I really don't remember which ones with in this picture and but you
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.160]   know it doesn't matter I mean it just like here you go right one of them is the
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.800]   other one and the other so you know that I think there was this earlier you know
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.000]   there was a debate at a certain point in time in the making of C60 oil whether
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.080]   you know stirring versus son of Kate you know and there's this camp saying
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.120]   never son of Kate and there's other camp that son of Kate's and hey you know
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.040]   what at the end of the day you get this you get to you get the same product it's
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.680]   exactly the same and if you're and if you're worried about son of cation like I
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.480]   pointed out in the video hey C60 is a super antioxidant it's going to
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.160]   make it mitigate the any effects of you know lipid-rencidity over time and if
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.880]   you take it quick enough like if you know I drink a probably a leader of this
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.880]   stuff a month so I'm gonna burn through it so fast that you know it's not it's
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.400]   not an issue bottom line is you pretty much get the same result so that was that
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.720]   experiment wanted to share with you this one was the jar experiment and when I
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.080]   said longevity that's that form of the original ancient biohackers who adopted
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.920]   C60 back in starting in 2012 when the Paris rat study came out there was this
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.680]   group of people and if you go to that forum and you read those ancient posts
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:45.320]   back in the old days of C60 yeah like seven years ago right but you read those
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.960]   old posts and there's there's lots of really fascinating threads there's a
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.600]   couple of real famous guys that came out of that and there's just you know and
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.640]   they talk a lot about the beginning days of people trying to you know figure
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.820]   out how to replicate that study taking it and documenting the results
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.360]   sharing the results with each other and then I kind of keep an eye on that for
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.200]   the last couple years and there's not a lot of people posting to it anymore you
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   know they've kind of moved on to different supplements like NMM and you know
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.280]   you name it so but back in the day there was this one guy who commented that he
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.800]   actually just he didn't use a stir he didn't use this on a cater he just put
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.680]   it in a jar and he shook it up and he just would take sip out of the jar and
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.800]   when it got low he would put more oil in it and and so I decided here you know
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.520]   I'll give that a try so the jar experiment is really a residual 60 that
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.320]   was left over from this experiment what I did was I poured some coconut oil in
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.520]   each one of these puppies and I just just shook it like crazy until all of that
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.920]   lifted up and off the bottom which was very hard as you know and then I just
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.720]   poured it into this jar is just random jar in cupboard and so I got a small jar
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.480]   coconut oil I just shook the crap out of it a few times and and then I forgot
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.200]   about it actually lost it and I don't remember where I put it and then I found
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.000]   it and I put it away and then I found it I lost it again and but anyway I
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.120]   forgot it I forgot I was doing this but I did find it and then I filtered it and
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:20.680]   I made a video hey ta-da and so this was the jar and this all I mean all of this
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.920]   right was went into this jar so there is probably I mean I'm gonna guess like
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.320]   a easy half a gram of C60 in that tiny little jar with coconut you can see how
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:37.120]   just shaking the crap out of it turned it this really dark crimson color so
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:43.240]   anyway I poured off the top of the jar into into my little baby center filter
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.120]   it's so it's I forgot the name of the center glass filter right there's that
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.840]   center there and and this is like a 30 milliliter one anyway so here's the
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.320]   bottom of the jar and so there's a lot left I mean there's like it's black and
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.440]   there's thick and and so you could tell there's a lot left but the point is is
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.960]   that by shaking it up right I was able to create C60 oil and so here's the
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.560]   filter and here's my horrible job at trying to cut out a circle because that
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.720]   new little 30 milliliter so small I don't have a filter that fits it but that was
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.880]   the filter and then here is the end product and it's really hard to kind of
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.100]   show the coloration because my kitchen's not that bright and I was just kind of
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.440]   moving this thing around but there's this moment right here right about now
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.000]   boom where the light catches it and you could see that dark purple in there and
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.320]   you know this dusty dark purple is usually always the color of the second
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:45.240]   and third batches of MCT using residual C60 so this is C60 oil no stirring no
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.480]   sonication put in jar and shake so I thought that was pretty cool wanted to
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.280]   share that with you it works and of course I just put more oil actually I I
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.560]   took that whatever's left over in that tiny little green jar I've now moved it
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.680]   over into a little bit bigger jar put more oil in it and shut the crap out of
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.520]   it and it's sitting in the somewhere in my my lab yeah I'll find it two months
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.800]   from now and try it out anyway so there's an idea for you know I mean it's
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.720]   interesting because it kind of just tells us that you know it's a little bit
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.800]   simpler than it needs to be in terms of making C60 oil of course you know
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.360]   everyone's trying to replicate the rat study blah blah blah but you know there
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.800]   you go okay I'm just saying now the next thing was I went out after the that
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.440]   video and I bought it one of those triangle stir bars you know and I
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.720]   wanted to give that a try and I use this in a in a concoction I'm actually I'm
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.560]   doing a video about this this type of oil that I made this with and so I used
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.520]   a stir bar and I kind of wanted to share with you what happened was after two
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.320]   weeks I mean look at this thing by the way this is a magnet that I used to pull
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.480]   this out of the jar flask and so I pulled this thing out I mean the oil was
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.640]   the oil that I was using with this with was is so thick I couldn't see it you
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.000]   know so I didn't know this was happening I couldn't see inside the oil and then
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   after two weeks I go to take this thing out and remember now these triangle guys
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.760]   are meant to pull sediments off of the bottom of the flask and and fling it up
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.480]   up you know into the interior of the of the solvent or the other liquid that
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.320]   you're trying to stir so I used it with C60 and this is what happened it was
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.920]   just covered in C60 this thing just like caked on to the to the stir bar and
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.800]   then with you I don't think oh yeah I didn't do a video I'll show you in in
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.560]   the next video but the bottom of the jar looked like it got scraped clean so
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.680]   this thing acted like a little scraper but instead of throwing it up into this
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.400]   into the oil so that it could mix it's stuck to the stupid stir bar and it's
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:51.800]   kind of pissing me off because that's really so I wiped it off just to see you
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.800]   know just to visualize how much C60 that stir bar took out of the oil and look
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.800]   that's a lot so it's like I would say more than half of what I put in the jar
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.080]   got taken away by the stir bar it kind of ruined my experiment and I was really
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.000]   pissed and I was thinking man you know screw these triangle bars that they don't
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.200]   work at all so I don't recommend that and then you know then I tried I've tried
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.400]   it roughly in the same time period doing another I was doing some other stuff
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.280]   and I was starting I forgot even forgot what oil I was using but and I use one
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.640]   of these nub guys and what these nub guys are for there's this like it's a
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.240]   stir bar but it's got this little rib here and look what happened to this guy
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.400]   after two weeks of stirring this is a nub one this guy right here that's that
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.400]   had a nub it had a nub and look what I have two weeks of stirring and C60 oil
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:48.920]   the nub just came clean off and you know it's like if you ever needed another
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.600]   reason why you should filter there you go because all this teflon right here
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:59.400]   that was here is in the oil and I didn't really realize that and you know but I
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.640]   filter everything through a 0.22 micron filter so I was like oh you know so I
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.800]   filtered out I will I hope I filtered out all of that teflon I didn't want to
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.320]   throw out a whole batch of C60 oil I mean it was a small batch but you know
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.840]   it's just like it was like there's another upsetting it was like wait a
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:21.000]   minute you know this this thing a it worked as a stir bar but B it left all
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.080]   that it basically grinded off the teflon and put the teflon in my oil I'm
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.960]   pretty sure I did filter it out but that's not good so it's trial and error
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.960]   and just passing this along cuz sharing with you guys is what I do so now this
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.920]   one here it's just a little outtake where I actually got to use power tools
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.080]   which is for a guy that's like a major like yeah you know it's so anyway I got
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:50.840]   to use some power tools you can see 60 oh but what I did basically though is I
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:56.840]   wanted to just kind of tinker around with how do I take the air out of the
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.360]   flask while I'm stirring the oil because there's a couple of really good points
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.200]   that were made on the on the chat group recently and and one of them was was
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.840]   you don't want to get you know on the very top of the oil there's that little
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:13.840]   dimple when the when the when the oil is spinning and the thing is is you you
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.440]   want that dimple but you don't want a tornado and the reason that was brought
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.720]   up was if you create a little tornado at the top of the oil it's going to pull
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.080]   air into the oil and you don't want to that's bad because remember the two
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:32.880]   things you want to absolutely avoid when making C 60 oil is air and light and so
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.520]   so I was just kind of thinking about that and tinkering around thinking okay
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.400]   how do I you know it's easy to get the light turn it off right but the how do I
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.320]   get the air but out of the flask between the bottom of the stopper and the top of
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.840]   the oil and then you don't have to worry about the tornado effect and and so I
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.920]   was thinking well why don't I just put a put a valve in there I already have a
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.520]   pump so I you know grab my rubber stopper took my drill drilled a hole in the
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.320]   stopper and I got this little green aquarium valve just like it was like a
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.200]   buck you know so one this is a whole one dollar experiment and then you know I
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.640]   already got the pump we all have pumps we all have stoppers y'all probably have
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.880]   a drill and so it's a dollar and then of course you get some C 60 oil so you
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.720]   know it's a pretty simple experiment it was just an experiment to see you know
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.680]   what would happen I have a second version of this using you know lab
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.680]   equipment a whole whopping ten dollar experiment but this is a one dollar
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.800]   experiment you drill a hole you take the little and this is an air valve it's
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.760]   for aquarium pumps and I just just shove it in there you know of course you make
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.200]   the drill the whole smaller than thing but so then and that's it you just stick
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.160]   it in there yep yep you push it down real hard you create an airtight seal
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.240]   right by pushing it down hard while your oil is stirring you open up the valve
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:53.120]   right and that's it just ta-da and then of course you know you you plug you plug
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.200]   your you know you got it and swifts don't have a button but I think the new ones
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.520]   do I got an old one so the old one doesn't have a switch so just turn it on
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.320]   it's gonna suck all the air out because this valve needs to be open the first
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.640]   time I did it I don't think it's close anyway and then I let it run for like
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.120]   ten minutes to suck you know because it's not that strong a pump so I just
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.400]   run it for ten minutes it sucks all the air out creates a vacuum in between the
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.480]   bottom of the stopper top of the oil here I'm just closing the valve see the
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.200]   valve is tight and when you're done you got just pop this puppy out it actually
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.040]   pops right out like that it sticks to the there you go and you're done and you
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.440]   have now created a vacuum where there's no air you put it in dark and you've got
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.400]   like the absolute perfect conditions for making C60 oil so there you go now
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.560]   this one here is C60 Udo's oil and it's kind of funny somebody came on the
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.440]   forum and they asked if anyone's making C60 Udo oil and I was like yeah I made
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.520]   it and then I realized well I never really did a video about it or talked
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:55.680]   about it before but yeah this is what I make C60 this is my go-to daily sort of
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:01.960]   oil I mean I my daily oil after like a while now I've kind of settled into this
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:07.160]   I take a tablespoon of Udo's C60 and a tablespoon of caprylic acid which is
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:12.760]   MCT the caprylic acid as you know is like brain amp juice and the Udo's oil is
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.520]   my supplement of Omega 3 6 and 9 and so you know it works out really well
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.440]   because one of the things the reason I started taking Udo's oil and of course
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.480]   making it into a C60 right and combine things because that's what I do was
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:33.760]   because I get a like a full-on blood work every year and then after the first
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.080]   year of doing C60 and I recommend y'all do this too this is pretty good
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.560]   important thing to do but I you know for like five six years in a row I've had
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.280]   really good cholesterol I mean under the numbers in the normal range no reason
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.200]   to take drugs I'm good you know and then one year though after the first year I
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:55.400]   was taking C60 oil because I take a lot you know my cholesterol went up and and
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.480]   there was only one thing that could have done that and it was because I was
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:04.000]   taking a more oil than I normally did because I also take I used to take an
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Omega oil supplement for to get the 3 6 and 9 Omega's and so I decided well I
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.280]   need to cut down an oil that's why you know I don't know if you know if you've
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.760]   seen my videos on the topical C60 I am I'm really driven to try to find a way
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.360]   to take C60 with less oil and this was just one way so I got rid of my
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.840]   krill oil so that's how I was getting my amigas and so I decided I'll just take
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:31.840]   my C60 in Omega oils and then I got less oil so now I no longer have to take
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.440]   oil twer you know in other words I was taking krill oil for the Megas and taking
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:41.640]   C60 oil for C60 so if I get rid of the krill and I just take I combine the two
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.960]   now I'm taking less oil every day and and hopefully cholesterol gets better so
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:51.600]   that was the idea behind oodos oil now in terms of oodos oil basically here's
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:57.240]   my materials and methods I buy a 32 ounce of oodos oil Amazon 34 bucks one
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:03.800]   gram of C60 right now it's running 120 in the shellogram C60 tech group co-op
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.880]   okay so we're we buy I don't know if you know this we buy or not we but you know
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.280]   we have a volunteer who actually goes out and acquires a large quantity C60
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.400]   in bulk just like a co-op and then resells one to five grams to anyone who
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.640]   needs it for the little guy who who wants to save some money so it's right
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.360]   now that the going price for a gram is 120 so I got some some of that and then
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.320]   of course you need your flask magnetic stir your filter your pump you know it's
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:33.560]   your basic make some C60 oil stir two weeks rest one week filter it okay so
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:38.600]   but the cool thing is is that the net cost for me to take my omega vitamins or
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.280]   my mega oil supplements plus the C60 it comes out the 481 an ounce you know
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.640]   that's actually lower than retail if you were to buy just regular C60 oil not to
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:53.760]   mention you know C60 Omega 3 6 and 9 oil right so there you go but a little
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.600]   bit about omeo oodos it's it's it's actually a very superior oil it's it's
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.320]   got all the right things going forward it's vegan on GMO blah blah blah and
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.360]   then here's your your basically breakdown of 3 6 and 9 and it's got a
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.680]   lot of different oils or different fatty acids in it and it's very very healthy
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.320]   one of the things and it's really cool look at how yellow that is but just real
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:20.480]   quick the guy who came up with this formula if you just google him or not
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:26.160]   or just go on YouTube you'll find out that he was he came up like 30 40 years
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.440]   ago into the nutrition world and he's really an older guy in the 70s and he
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:37.000]   was like on par with Atkins were at the time if you remember years ago you know
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.560]   and it probably you still see that is that you know fats are bad and then these
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.920]   two guys you know said no no no you know the rest of you scientists got it
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:50.240]   wrong fats are not just good they're critical and so Atkins was all about
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.120]   eating meats and fats and when everyone was saying don't eat red meat don't
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.640]   take fats you know he was all about the Atkins diet now which has become of
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.680]   course now the ketogenic diet which is a huge fat and it's also not just a fat
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.280]   it's actually really healthy for you and then the other thing was Dr. Udo was
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.280]   out there promoting his special blend of mega oils telling everybody you need
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.920]   this you have to take oils you need a diet that has fats and everybody was
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.520]   doing low fats and so he has this one video where he tells a story about he
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.720]   had to go out and to prove to people he was right he went and solicited a bunch
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:30.080]   of athletes long distance runners and he basically had like three or four or
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:36.080]   whatever number them start taking his oil right right before a run and follow
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.640]   this diet that he put together but it was high fat diet and giving using his oil
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.680]   and the results of his experiments at the time this is a long time ago was that
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:50.480]   these runners that were actually taking a high fat diet before a run out performed
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:56.360]   their prior results by up to like 60 percent they ran longer and faster and
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:02.880]   had less what do you know recovery time you know after the race and so he
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.840]   really proved this point he became kind of like an Atkins guy in that world if
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.680]   you follow it and so forth so it's interesting so I highly recommend Udo's
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.360]   all of course I don't get anything for selling that I don't endorse stuff so
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.120]   okay but here's the first point I want to make first of all it's really cool
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.960]   yellow looking so I don't know if you think you know it's just cool and the
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.520]   second thing is is just to make a point this thing the viscosity of this oil is
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:31.240]   similar to olive oil okay so if you're using this little green IntelliLab
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.560]   whoops the IntelliLab this guy right here if you're using this guy which is
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.120]   fine it works but this guy like I said in my other video it's just not
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:44.280]   powerful enough to stir one whole leader and I just wanted to prove it to you by
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:48.680]   showing you this you put I put a justice for demonstrations I put a full leader
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.760]   of the Udo's in the flask turned on the stir ran it up pulled it and pushed it up
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.360]   to the two o'clock position on the dial and look there's nothing you don't see
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.800]   any dimple the top is not even moving so I really want to emphasize this point
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:08.440]   about using the IntelliLab stir trying to stir a leader of something it just
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.840]   doesn't work if you don't see the dimple this half of the oil is not even
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.240]   moving and you're not going to get a high quality C60 oil product with good
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:22.440]   saturation so you really need to make sure you can see that dimple so what do
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.280]   you do well I just cut it in half so I just put 500 milliliter I pour the other
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.600]   half out right turn it on and there you go you've got the dimple going on and
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.000]   so now you know that that oil all of the oil is moving and just for fun I do
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.880]   here's just the shot of me adding the powdered C60 because it's kind of cool
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:44.040]   how it just kind I don't know if you do this but I kind of like to watch it I
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.480]   like to watch this part of the of the process it's kind of cool how the C60
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.400]   just drops in and the way it's moving around and slamming into each other but
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.080]   you know within a few minutes literally the whole thing turns black right and
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:00.600]   then this is at this point of the process is you know where I put the
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.640]   stopper on and suck all the air out and move on to the next flash so yeah it's
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.360]   cool so this is a hoodles oil C60 hoodles oil give it a try all right so
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.240]   that that's the last of my out takes want to share the updates now a couple
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.080]   of weeks ago the live pet folks I and Mitchell is the vice president I think
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.080]   of research and development operations and so forth they put out a news news
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.160]   bulletin they're also on a I'll link it in the video description so he was
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.520]   actually on a recent interview where he talked about producing the patent and
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:39.040]   so forth and he's also talked about their work the live pet companies work
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:44.440]   towards creating an animatostatic cancer serum for dogs they've been on
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.880]   Sarah Westall they've been on the bulletproof podcast and this other podcast so
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.840]   there's there's basically three separate interviews if you're interested in
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.560]   researching more learning more about it where I and Mitchell is interviewed about
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.640]   the work that they've done they finally were issued their patent and it just
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:05.200]   came out a couple of weeks ago and this is monumental and and in many different
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.560]   ways and just for full disclosure I'm actually did sign my dog up for one of
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.960]   the trials for this and I'm under an NDA so I can't talk a lot about the
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:20.440]   details of the of the protocol but I but since this is public I'd like to just
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:27.720]   share it with you and I cannot emphasize enough how incredibly important this is
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:36.040]   to all mammals on the planet if you understand what I'm saying so this is
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.600]   now out in public he's got his patent and what that means for all of us is at
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.840]   the products coming soon after this and I would assume and I'm just guessing I
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.640]   haven't chatted with ions and see published the the I mean he got the patent
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.480]   awarded to him so I don't know what the time frames are but I think it's like
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.960]   in normally it's going to be you know at least a couple years before it hits
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.800]   production commercial product where they're actually selling the product I
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.120]   know that he'd mentioned in the last interview that they're also working on
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:10.000]   a line of dog food that'll accompany the protocol because it's part of the
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.800]   protocol is to also follow you know a ketogenic diet or very restricted diet
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   so they're creating a food product that'll go with the serum and then together
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:28.600]   what this does is it actually stops tumors from growing and so what he did
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.280]   and this is in the patent it is quite fascinating of course link below to the
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:40.840]   patent but they took a C60 molecule and they attached a saccharide molecule and
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.080]   saccharides are sugars right so they attached a sugar molecule to the to the
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:50.040]   C60 and then they looks this to me looks like it's not clear what exactly this
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:55.080]   is I think they're using olive oil so it's a long chain fatty acid molecule and
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:01.000]   then of course there's a OH which is oxygen hydrogen molecules as well so I'm
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.640]   not really sure clear on what this piece of the of the of the molecule is but
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.720]   this is clearly a long chain this is a saccharide and they created what is
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:16.120]   called a lipofluorine saccharide conjugate that's what that's called and
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:23.200]   this molecule has a incredible effect on cancer cells and if you read the
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.920]   patent and I just kind of want to share that with you this is here right here on
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.840]   the live pet site you click on news and you this article pulls up but what what
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.040]   I really want to show you is and you could read the full patent here and let's
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:39.000]   go to that in a second but when they basically took their mice this was part
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.920]   of the experiment they took mice they gave the mice cancer and then they gave
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:48.960]   the mice the serum and look this is week six of the mice developing the cancer
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.600]   they're using a green fluorescent type of enzyme that shows up on a whatever
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.840]   equipment they're using I forgot the name of it and it's bright or green and
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:03.760]   then they give them the serum in point five weeks three and a half days after
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:09.120]   they start the protocol it's a seven week protocol look at the tumors and the
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.720]   size of those tumors so you know the patent goes on and on it's quite a
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:23.840]   detailed patent about about this about the new anesthetic serum and so it goes
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:27.560]   into here basically just and I just want to point out there's that diagram and
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:33.480]   then there's a lot of a lot of charts a lot of mouse mouse pictures showing all
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.600]   the things so I just want to see if I can find this one graphic kind of want to
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:41.880]   show the one graph in the patent that I thought was just pertinent that's kind
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.560]   of a bummer it's sideways but basically this line right here is the size of the
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.760]   tumor and in the volume of the tumor and these are the number of days after you
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.120]   know so they started day zero they start treating the mouse at day zero the
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.000]   mouse has got a big ass - sorry sorry apologize for that word it's got a big
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.800]   tumor and so they give them the serum and then right about day 33 day 40 boom
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:14.920]   it's gone so that's pretty interesting if you understand the concept of how long
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.800]   it's been that mankind has been trying to cure cancer and and I'm used that
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:24.680]   word that is my word that is not a word in the patent that is not anything that
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:29.600]   iron has ever said but I did use that four-letter word I'm you have to be
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:35.400]   really careful with that word but it's you know when the thing goes to zero and
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.720]   it doesn't exist anymore that says something so the last thing I want to
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.720]   point out about the patent if you have a chance to read it is the there's three
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.720]   case studies at the end talking about dogs that had tried it and it was just
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.880]   just an amazing I mean it's amazing where like case study - you know
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.920]   approximately ten-year-old dog was found to have a tumor between its subject
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.320]   shoulder blades - this actual this one was interesting because it had a litter
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:05.120]   mate that had the exact same cancer and it died and so this other dog was
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:12.480]   treated and it kicked it it lived it lit its litter mate had died of the same
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:17.760]   cancer in the same place the dog that took the serum survived and is doing
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.320]   really well and here it is by the end of January the coughing had stopped it was
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:26.960]   coughing because the tumor was pressing on its lungs and and and it had basically
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.880]   and the tumor was no longer obviously visible without touching the subject
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.240]   to feel it and that the owner had estimated that the tumor had shrunk by
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:41.480]   two-thirds and happy dogs so you know this is goes beyond amazing and you know
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:47.560]   you know I just recently lost my dog and you know timing is everything and I
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:52.680]   got I do have another dog and so this is just amazing I'm very emotional about
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:57.520]   dogs dying of cancer let me tell you but for iron to do this I I congratulate you
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:03.320]   iron thank you for existing on planet earth thank you for for doing this anyway
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:09.360]   so link below take a look at the patent so new a new formula for red lion they
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.120]   you know they tinker so if anyone you know hopefully you're not getting
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.400]   frustrated that they keep changing the formula not doing it on purpose well
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.680]   actually I guess they are doing it on purpose but they're doing it on purpose
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:22.320]   to find a better product to make a better quality etc etc and so here's the new
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:27.160]   formula and this came out in the June 8th newsletter for those of you who are
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.880]   not familiar with the fact that they actually have newsletters sign up get
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.560]   their newsletters I think a ton of information in those newsletters about
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.400]   what's going on at red lion and you know just following the story of them
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.720]   building ark reactors and developing their own c60 powder and or not powder
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.640]   but you know they don't see 60 raw c60 it's just fascinating anyway so they
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:49.000]   have a newsletter the June 8th newsletter said hey we're we got this new
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.240]   formula give it a try and so this is it and really this this little hairy arm
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.560]   right here is actually not me this is Gregory Johnson on the telegram c60 chat
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:02.560]   group and he's the first guy to give it a try I believe and so he basically told
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:07.000]   me or told us in the chat that he he took this dock pot filled it up with I
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:13.280]   think five liters of olive oil core Nikki olive oil put it on a hot plate and he's
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:19.160]   following this protocol and so it is basically and this again this is what's
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:23.720]   amazing about these new that you know the jar thing in this thing is that these
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:30.080]   are people making c60 without stirs without sonication you know they're
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.240]   just making it different ways which I think is great as a tinkerer that's
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:40.120]   that's to me an awesome development so basically it's and this is using pulver
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.920]   I see 60 from red line you mix the c60 with high quality olive oil mixed very
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.720]   well step two you heat it now you take the stock pot you heat it to 85 degrees
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.360]   centigrade that's like about a hundred and seventy six Fahrenheit for 24 hours
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:57.920]   for one day and then let it sit for 10 days without heat this was the original
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.640]   formula in the newsletter and then at 10 days mix very well heated again for
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.720]   one whole day then let it settle for further four days or longer if you want
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:13.080]   and then just filter it and bottle it that's it that's the new formula Greg's
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:18.480]   halfway through he just reported a few days ago that he got a pro tip from
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:24.640]   Karen about about doing that and so that so there's Karen is the office manager
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:31.160]   human at red lion and you know high Karen and so she just pointed this is
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:35.920]   what Greg wrote in the telegram chat was just a point of information those are
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.760]   using the new red line protocol for PC 60 that means pulver I see 60 Karen from
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:45.360]   red line gave us a pro tip she suggested keeping the oil at 37 degrees centigrade
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:50.960]   during the 10 day settling process and after the second 20 hour and okay so
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.160]   during the 10 so during these 10 days Karen's now saying hey you know what
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.240]   pro tip keep it at 37 degrees centigrade not room temperature just keep it a
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.560]   little bit warmer than warm room temperature okay while it's settling and
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.920]   then and then after the on the second day you heated back up to that 80 you
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:15.240]   know 85 degrees centigrade and then let it settle again and that's that's the
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.280]   pro tip you can just you know you can just read it right here and then that
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.840]   you know the thing that I pointed out about sonication in my sonication
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:26.320]   video was you know the sonicators turn really hot right and they get really
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:31.160]   hot and I noticed that when I sonicate olive oil it gets hot and when it gets
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.540]   hot it doesn't taste very good and so I'm just I was really like okay what's up
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.360]   with that and so Greg is actually saying that after the first heat you know the
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.760]   first 24 hours and now it's currently his batches now just sitting on the hot
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.760]   plate at these running you know this is just showing 38 but you know it goes up
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:53.080]   and down right supposed to 37 but anyway that you know the oil taste normal after
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.520]   the first 11 heat and so that's awesome and then I you know I talked with Martin
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:02.000]   and he also said that he hadn't noticed any dig degradation and taste so I think
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.360]   that I'm just thinking that maybe I was using the just a not a not a great
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.920]   quality of olive oil you know and so I asked Greg what kind of olive oil he
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:17.240]   was using and he showed me this and it's a no it's called the Minoan Minoan
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:22.720]   brand extra virgin olive oil it's corn necky directly from Greece and you
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:28.040]   know the cool thing about Greg and kudos to you man was he he figured out how to
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:32.640]   buy this stuff but he goes to a Greek restaurant who buys it in bulk and so
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.000]   of course it's like you know the Greek selling to Greek so you know that they
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.920]   know what's going on you're not getting fake stuff because they're selling it
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.040]   in their restaurant and that restaurant has the I guess the distribution rights
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.560]   for this type of oil and so he buys it from the restaurant so pro tip from Greg
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:52.040]   go to a Greek restaurant and see if those tell you the oil so that's kind of
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.480]   cool so that's the oil he's using that's the new recipe or the formula you know
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.840]   give it a try I haven't given it a try it I've got so many things on my stirs
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.680]   all my stirs are full as you could tell from this video I do a bunch of things
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.040]   all the time so I can't even get to this thing for a while and they don't have a
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:11.040]   hot plate stir I mean Greg had when I don't have a hot plate stir I have a
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:15.040]   hot plate but I don't really want to you know so it any by the way he's not
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:19.080]   stirring it he's just using the hot plate so that's that's that that's kind of
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:26.080]   cool formula for making C60 oil without magnetic stirring just mix and heat and
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.560]   sit and mix and heat and sit pretty interesting in it okay so my last update
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:38.880]   for C60 was Dave at C60 Labs he sent in a video to me just to kind of show me
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.040]   and wanted you know said he go ahead and share this which was you know how he
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.000]   does it and so this is kind of cool because as you probably can guess you
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.600]   know I really keep my eye on C60 stuff and there no one has ever shared the
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.440]   behind the scenes at a commercial lab so I thought it was really cool and I just
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:03.080]   wanted to share it with you I'm gonna do a rural low you know low low tech audio
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.500]   here but I just wanted you to share this here you go these stirs we use are
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:12.800]   maelstrom we typically stir in three liter flasks this is not through their
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:20.720]   flasks but I threw some extra in this five liter beaker this year example of
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:25.280]   how powerful this this magnetic stir is we're using a two-inch bar standard bar
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:31.680]   came with the unit and we're mixing with four and a half liters of MCT oil before
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:40.000]   we get ready to filter it we typically run 50 plus of these mixers at a time and
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.280]   we've been running for out means two years now we've never had one fail so we
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.120]   still are working with the original 50 that we purchased a few years back we
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:53.880]   don't have any questions and we'll talk to you later so we're gonna be all about
[00:36:53.880 --> 00:37:06.800]   going to get 10 of the avocado for the MCT to the end and the simpler so totally
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.700]   cool thanks Dave for sharing that I mean this is kind of interesting
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:14.040]   this is only open just want to point out some things that I clarified this is
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:18.840]   only open for the demonstration of this video it's a three liter flasks two-inch
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.920]   stir bar using a maelstrom stir this is not a hot plate so it's stirred at room
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:27.360]   temperature he does cover them you can't really see it in the video but these are
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.680]   all covered while they're stirring these maelstroms you can actually get them on
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.180]   ebay I think they're lying 130 bucks or something but they don't have a heat
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.360]   pad but you know what's really cool what he said was he's been running his you
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:43.180]   know all of these like right here you see all those in the video he's been
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:47.280]   running a whole bunch of these things every day 24 hours a day for two years
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:52.660]   and not one of them have failed and that's pretty amazing so this is a pretty
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:57.580]   hearty little piece of equipment if you're looking for a magnetic stir for big
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:02.820]   batches you know totally cool there and then the other thing about this room that
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.620]   I asked him about you know they do cover it you just it's kind of hard to see
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:09.920]   that they're all covered was that this is their clean room so they actually have
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:15.120]   a clean room dedicated to their mixing and to their preparations which is a
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:19.080]   sign of you know the professionalism that's anyone you know I run into a lot of
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.880]   people that want to get into selling C60 oil and I can't emphasize enough how
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:28.000]   important you got to follow basic FDA kind of regulations which is you know
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.960]   you're producing something people are going to ingest so this should have a
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.920]   clean room you know all those protocols cover your head cover your feet all that
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:38.340]   kind of stuff and so it's this is amazing I just wanted to say thank you for
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:43.020]   sharing first time in history I think that I mean I'm just saying that anyone
