[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   Hello everyone and this is another carbon 60 video by me Kay Elmer and in this
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.920]   video I'm going to discuss how to make and why you would want to make a C60 CBD
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.680]   crystal oil as a part two from my original C60 CBD oil video that I made a
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.360]   while back. So let's jump in I've got a couple of disclosures I want to make
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.160]   sure everybody knows this material is for research purposes only C60 oil is not
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.440]   approved for consumption by the FDA this is not medical or health advice this is
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.160]   not a product endorsement I do not sell C60 or CBD products and I don't get paid
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.560]   anyways do videos this is 100% unbiased so let's jump in. All right my first
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.080]   experiment a little while ago is I bought a commercial CBD oil product called
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.800]   Charlotte's web off of their website about $150 and I mixed in C60 into the
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.680]   CBD oil that was my first experiment and that was the first video now in this
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.880]   second video I've decided thanks to a so one of the subscriber comments thank
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.520]   you very much you know you are I suggested that it be you know it'd be a
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.480]   different way to try it would be to use CBD isolates so I went ahead and gave
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.480]   that a shot and the results are actually quite remarkable I mean in terms of
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.960]   better faster cheaper all right so in the second experiment there's two ways
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.680]   you could do it and I did it the first way which is I just made my own so I you
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.840]   take oil you mix in C60 you make your own C60 oil I've got several videos that
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.600]   cover that and then you mix in your CBD isolates and this is kind of an
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.360]   important point and I want to talk about in that a second or the second way you
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.080]   could do it is just buy C60 oil and add CBD isolates now the point that I'm
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.440]   trying to make here is in the first experiment the CBD was in the oil then I
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.120]   added the C60 and because I did that I didn't filter it because the thing about
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.720]   CBD the molecule it's 1000 nanometers large okay a C60 molecule is one
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.760]   nanometer so if you add the C60 to the CBD oil you can't filter out the excess
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.840]   suspended C60 and from what I've been learning lately and I mentioned this in
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.600]   my last video you need to filter you do not want to have large clusters of
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.920]   carbon or C60 carbons or whatever any kind of carbon in your body it's gonna
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.680]   clog up and get stuck in your kidneys and you'll have problems so you want to
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.920]   make sure you filter so doing it this way you cannot filter because if you
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.960]   filter you'll filter out the excess C60 but you're gonna filter out all of the
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.440]   CBD don't want to do that but you know so don't do it this way I've learning
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.800]   we're moving along this is we're sharing sharing what we learn here and this is
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.080]   all research right so now the better way to do it is to add this ice the
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.240]   isolate or the CBD last so that when you make this you filter out the
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.640]   suspended excess C60 and then you have this purified you know beautiful C60
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.520]   oil then you add your isolates okay so you can either make it yourself or buy
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.120]   it either one I'll show you the difference in cost here now if you make
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.040]   your own and if you guys watched the last video on how to make C60 oil with
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.480]   pulverized C60 you know 30 milliliters is about the same as one ounce right and
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.920]   so it only cost me two dollars and 71 cents to make a little bottle of C60
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.880]   oil so you make your own oil and then you buy the isolate powder so that CBD
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.960]   can come floating in a hemp oil or it can come as a powder just like you know
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.420]   C60 basically and so I used the same I wanted to do an apples to apples
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.280]   comparison so the first experiment was with 1500 milligrams the second one is
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.120]   the same instead of buying the oil though I just bought the powder and that's that
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.360]   was $45 so I did find a site that sells it for there's a lot of sites out
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.320]   there by the way that sell it for like a lot of money like $60 or plus and then
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.800]   I found a site that sells it for 30 found another site that sells it for 24
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.800]   it's all in the video description links below and so I bought the one for 30 and
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.280]   so at $30 for one ounce it comes out to 45 for an ounce and a half right and so
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:24.600]   total expenditure to be able to make a bottle of CBD crystal oil or C60 CBD
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.800]   crystal oil sorry it was $47.71 makes one bottle okay or if you want to just buy
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.560]   it you can buy a bottle of C60 oil the average price per ounce is 10
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.200]   dollars and 15 cents if you check out the pricing guide I have and so that's
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.960]   the average price going right now in the market per oil you know per ounce okay
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.160]   of course you buy the isolates and that's 45 and then total cost would be $55.15
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.480]   so it's a little bit more expensive because you're buying it instead of
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.200]   making it but the idea here is quite simply this the first experiment because
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:06.160]   I bought a 150 dollar bottle of CBD oil the cost was $177.49
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.440]   for that one little bottle okay now doing it with CBD crystals
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.040]   the cost reduction is anywhere from 69% to 73 or I'm sorry 73%
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.160]   to 69% cheaper if you do it this way and that is a huge
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.160]   cost saving so for those of you guys who are hesitant and didn't want to try
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.080]   CBD C60 or just don't want to try CBD
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.080]   then you know honestly just go and buy the isolates you can get you can go
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.480]   just get one gram for 24 dollars and 45 cents on this one site
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.680]   and for 24 bucks you can go ahead and mix that in with your
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.720]   existing CBD I'm sorry your existing C60 oil and you'll have it you'll be
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.000]   able to have this and only cost you 20 25 bucks right
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.640]   or if you want to make it up to 1500 you know it'll be a little bit more than
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.080]   that but the idea here is it's a lot cheaper
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.080]   than the then it really looks at first glance when you start really kind of
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.240]   digging into it so big thing there you can go ahead and
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.840]   try it it's not cost prohibitive as everybody kind of thought in the
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.560]   beginning okay so that's a good thing so but the first you know but here my
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.440]   answer the answer this question here what are CBD crystals
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.080]   now for those of you who are not familiar with that
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.760]   and this is right off the CBD distillery site it sells it for 30 there's another
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.760]   site that sells it for 24 45 but off of this website
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.360]   this is what they say it's it's 99 plus percent pure
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.760]   CBD kenebinol isolates it's derived entirely from an
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.880]   industrial hemp oil that was extracted from the
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.000]   nature stocks and stems of the plant so it's
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.440]   it's comes from a non-gmo pesticide pesticide
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:50.000]   free farmed marijuana plant industrial hemp and it's basically boiled down and
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.040]   distilled and they've come out with this crystallized
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.760]   CBD which is one of the many different chemical compounds found in hemp and
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.080]   found in the marijuana plant and CBD is one of them there's other ones
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.080]   there's a triple-8s there's CBN's and all sorts of different kinds and of
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.320]   course THC which you're all familiar with because
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.440]   you know that's what gets you high but but all the other stuff is all of that
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.280]   actually is very very beneficial from a health standpoint but this is just
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.680]   the CBD aspect of it you know of the plant itself
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.440]   and that's what they extract it's comes in a crystalline powder form that's
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.800]   really easy to work with and it just comes from hemp oil there's no
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.960]   other active ingredients of course I said there's no
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.120]   THC so this is what the little bottle looks like
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.560]   okay so that's what a CBD crystal is it's just like CBD oil
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.480]   except it's just distilled down to just a powder okay
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.320]   so now the other question that you might want to be asking is you know why
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.960]   you know why you've been bothered with this now I want to chat about this for
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.560]   a little bit and I really want to point you to
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.880]   a video it's in the video description it's you know what are the benefits of
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.800]   CBD I've watched dozens of videos about CBD
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.760]   hemp oil etc from a health perspective and I and the one I'm recommending is
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.240]   the one in the links it is literally the absolute best video I have seen
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.280]   it is it makes it so clear to understand what CBD is
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.080]   and what it can do for you and so I'm just going to give you the quick you
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.600]   know like 60 second version of this video but please if you have I think
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.440]   it's 21 minutes if you have 21 minutes in your day even just listen to it in
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.960]   your car I highly recommend that you educate yourself
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.680]   on what is called the endocannabinoid system in your body
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.720]   and what that system is it is a system that regulates homeostasis
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.440]   that means the chemical balance of your entire of all your various
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.640]   systems in your body it maintains balance at chemical balance and it is so
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.320]   critical because without that balance you have
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.240]   chemical imbalances and chemical imbalances lead to
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.640]   inflammation inflammation leads to disease okay but what's really
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.400]   interesting okay is that this plant you know produces
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:08.000]   CBD and we produce CBD as human beings and it's
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.520]   what's it's just like vitamin D everybody sort of knows that hey you
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.280]   know what you have to have vitamin D to stay healthy right
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.040]   and you get it from sitting in the sun so it's just like that
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.320]   for cannabinoids to be produced by your body
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.680]   you have to go through you know you basically have to
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.840]   exercise vigorously like the runners high you know like that runners high
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.360]   people talk about who jog and run it's you know it's not only is it
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.480]   you know your brain releasing endorphins which gives you that buzz
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.920]   but it also releases your brain signals your body to release
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.400]   cannabinoids that go in and feed into your endocannabinoid system
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.600]   you also produce as humans produce cannabinoids like you would produce
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.800]   vitamin D from sunlight you also can produce it
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.400]   from meditating so you know I found that to be really interesting and
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.920]   they cover this in the video so think about that for a sec
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.640]   just like vitamin D your body produces it but
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.440]   it needs sunlight well you look on the other side
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.880]   just like vitamin D your body has an endocannabinoid system that's one of
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.040]   the most critical systems in your body that that basically is one of the
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.040]   drivers of your health and it requires cannabinoids
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.640]   from you know to be manufactured from your own body
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.280]   and you only can manufacture it if you're rigorously exercising
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.080]   or meditating and some other things I don't remember so
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.880]   those are the two things that stuck in my head okay so
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.240]   the other bullet point then right there is okay well are you doing that
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.080]   I mean how many of you meditate and do the whole yoga thing stretching
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.200]   exercising I mean I know there's a lot of you that do that but then a lot of
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.600]   us are basically typical Americans you know we've got our jobs our kids our
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.880]   lives or you know all this stuff going on and actually
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.120]   finding time to vigorously exercise or meditate
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.400]   you know who's you know the time who's got the time right
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.960]   if you've got kids and all that stuff going on so
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.080]   a lot of us don't meditate then we should you know it's good stuff and a
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.400]   lot of us don't exercise vigorously on a
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.360]   continual basis we know we should but we don't
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.720]   and so the lifestyle that we live just like living in the winter where you
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.480]   can't get out to the sun to get vitamin D so you need to supplement well it's
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.160]   just the same thing with cannabinoids if you don't do these things to produce
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.960]   cannabinoids then your body is deficient in cannabinoids and your endocannabinoid
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.440]   system cannot function the way that is meant to function and help you
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.280]   minimize inflammation in your body and keep your balance
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.160]   your homeostasis balance of chemicals in your body and so if you don't do that
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.400]   okay then you are opening yourself up for disease and I'll leave the rest of
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.280]   that video I highly encourage you understand
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.320]   what that system does and why you need cannabinoids
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.000]   to supplement its cannabinoids if you are not living that lifestyle I just
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.960]   described now I also have a personal opinion
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.280]   of why CBD plus C60 so if you guys have been following the videos or you're
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.480]   doing CBD I'm sorry C60 then you're going to
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.760]   understand that C60 has like this long list of things
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.160]   that's beneficial to the human body the most important one is this it reduces
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.320]   stress by being a radical oxygen species scavenger
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.600]   it goes in and it just hunts down those free radicals
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.240]   and then neutralizes them it's an electron donor which makes it like
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.120]   the super super antioxidant that exists right now
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.680]   172 times stronger than you know vitamin C and so forth it's just this
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.640]   awesome thing where it relieves physical literally
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.880]   at the cellular level at the quantum biology level of our bodies these this
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.640]   little molecule goes in there and just wipes out all that oxidative stress
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.080]   and it releases that burden that energy burden on ourselves
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.680]   to kind of have to deal with that and then what does that do it gives us energy it
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.040]   helps us heal it keeps us healthy and then on the other side of the range you
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.480]   know the other side of the scale is that it boosts energy one of the most
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.640]   interesting things if you have time study what the mitochondria does in
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.280]   your cells you know basically mitochondria
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.640]   produces ATP and it does that through an electron transfer
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.920]   from the foods you eat okay and what is C60 well it's an electron donor so when
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.680]   you take in C60 you're pumping your mitochondria because it can pass
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.440]   through the blood-bearing barrier you're pumping your mitochondria full of
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.960]   of molecules that donate electrons to the mitochondria
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.720]   and it produces what it produces C sorry ATP
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.120]   ATP is translated directly into energy it's like jump starting a car you boom
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.000]   you take C60 you just boosted your energy so the
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.040]   point that i'm making here in my humble opinion
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.800]   is that this incredible thing that C60 does for us
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.000]   it can be amplified it literally you could just boost it
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.400]   you know it's amazing by itself but if you drink hydrogen water
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.240]   okay you're adding a lot more antioxidant power
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.160]   to what you're doing and it you can just if you do it honestly if you're on C60
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.880]   and you drink hydrogen water you're going to feel this
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.480]   boost of energy and you know and it's just amazing i do this i've completely
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.680]   given up coffee you don't need it you just drink hydrogen water
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.120]   when you're on C60 and it's like drinking a you know a five-minute power
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.320]   drink you know every other every hour you don't you know so it's really
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.360]   amazing what what this side of the equation can do from the
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.720]   boost energy standpoint on the other side of the scale though
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.400]   in my opinion okay this is what CBD does for
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.120]   within combination with C60 it takes that oxidative stress reduction
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.960]   right and you and and because that's what that oxidative stress reduction
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:35.040]   equals lower inflammation so what does CBD do CBD lowers inflammation
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.920]   and because of the cannabinoid the endocannabinoid system in that thing i
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.240]   just described and so if you take CBD oil along with C60
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.720]   you're boosting the other side of the of the scale in terms of what C60 can
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.800]   C60 can do for you and and you're just magnifying the ability to reduce
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.520]   stress reduce inflammation inflammation and it
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.920]   just completely takes it to a whole another level
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.080]   on this side of the scale so that's my opinion based on just what i feel
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.880]   when i'm taking hydrogen water with C60 and when i take CBD with C60
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.480]   it's just it's the exact opposite effect this is
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.160]   calming and it just it's just it's just really calming
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.600]   and this one here is just really really energetic so
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.320]   it's an interesting combination it's something i've discovered from just
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.800]   dinking around and i just wanted to share it with you it's my research okay
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.280]   so how do you make it and this is it's the simplest thing in the world
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.640]   uh you know you if you've already got like i was saying up here
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.120]   if you've already made your C60 oil or you bought the C60 oil
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.920]   complete no brainer okay all you've got to do
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.560]   is you just basically to make your own oil tinctures this is from a website
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.880]   called CBD oils basically you just take any kind of
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.120]   oil you want you can use all of coconut hemp if
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.880]   if you were just going to make a CBD oil okay if you're just going to make a CBD
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.240]   oil you can use any kind of oil you want that make that you like
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.400]   but if you're going to you know make a C60 oil use C60 oil
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.160]   simply mix and then whatever amount you want i'm just going with this number
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.800]   because i want to be consistent with the last video
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.520]   from a price standpoint but this is what i did i added
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.840]   1.5 grams of crystals into 30 milliliters you'll see that you'll see
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.440]   this little video next 30 milliliters of my preferred
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.280]   oil which is C60 oil right and then basically i put it in a hot water bath
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:27.520]   at around 50 to 60 degrees Celsius which is about 122
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.720]   to 140 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.960]   and swirled it around a bunch of times kept it hot and
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:41.520]   basically that melts the C60 sorry it melts the CBD crystals
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.720]   and dissolves them into the C60 oil and that's it it's it doesn't get any
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.800]   simpler than that so let me just kind of walk you
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.720]   through what that looks like here we go so
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.960]   i have a bunch of different oils i've got sunflower i've made sunflower C60 oil
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.480]   i've got an olive C60 oil and i've got you know so anyway just
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.760]   i just grabbed my my favorite which is sunflower
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.200]   um i like that nutty taste and basically pour off
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.200]   um yeah in this experiment i i was using 40 milliliters
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.960]   but anyways so you pour off what you need obviously that's the starting point
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.120]   or just pour your bottle that you bought
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.200]   into a little flask um now this is what the container looks like that the
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.480]   crystals come in and then i've got my own little
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.920]   um a little mortar and pestle this is my clean one that uh
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.080]   it's not stained um and uh what's interesting is that the crystals come
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.600]   and they're kind of lumpy there's you can see the clusters in here
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.680]   uh so it's pretty lumpy and it's clusters of of just chunks of
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.680]   of crystals kind of stuck together so that's why i use this little tiny mortar
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.040]   and pestle this is what it looks like after i ground it up a little bit
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:51.120]   and then i added it to the flask and then put the flask in this little
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.440]   um thing of water and so my little pyrex
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.960]   cup measureer thing and so i put like basically i started with like boiling
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.560]   water in here i've got my my uh my thermometer you can see
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.680]   it it's like 116 you know so i basically put the
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.440]   thermometer in there i waited till the temperature went down
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.280]   till like around that you know that 122 to 140 degrees
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.440]   so i waited till like around 130 put the put the
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.680]   c60 oil with the crystals in it um into the into the
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.800]   the flask and then put that into the hot water bath
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.280]   and let it sit there for 10 minutes and here's my
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.400]   highly scientific method called swirling
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.760]   uh where i just swooshed it around a little bit and then put it back in the
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.880]   hot water so it can keep doing what it's going to do
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.920]   and you can see look at that color that's just beautiful it's at
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.680]   that crimson red lion gorgeous color anyway so there it is right there
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.320]   i'm done at this point it's after the 10 minutes
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.280]   you can see that it's pretty much no crystals there's no
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.400]   like you know sludge at the bottom everything's been dissolved
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.880]   or so you think it watch keep watching and then i poured into my myron bottle
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.000]   so uh but just a little point here everything i do i use myron m-i-r-o-n
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.920]   bottles these are uv protective um the jury's a little
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.240]   out about having to keep your c60 out of uv light for some reason i keep
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.360]   reading things that are contradicting but it is oil
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.520]   and it is c60 so uh better to err on the side of caution
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:25.840]   so keep everything you do when it comes to oils and c60 and even CBD
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:30.640]   in uv protective dark bottles so i buy these little bottles there's they come
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.560]   in all different sizes this is like a 30 milliliter milliliter one
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.000]   so i keep uh i poured into my myron bottle and then i'm good
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.200]   but now here's the thing at the very bottom of the flask uh i noticed that
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.680]   look at that you see that there was little actually there was
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.560]   actually i didn't see him at first until i poured off the top
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.480]   but there was still a little bit of crystals that did not dissolve
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.880]   uh and so of course you don't want to waste that
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.040]   so what i decided to do was uh i went ahead and just dropped the magnet in
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.200]   there and put it on the magnetic stir so uh doing that actually worked out
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.880]   pretty well um i just put it on the stir uh for about an hour
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.680]   that's that's what it looks like there is just whipping around like that
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.400]   and i just i just let it stir i took the dogs for a walk
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.200]   that's probably about an hour and then after the hour you can see
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.080]   um that all the crystals had dissolved from the
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.600]   from the stirring so it's completely dissolved now
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.480]   and i just poured the excess into a secondary bottle
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:32.000]   um and i'm good to go and that's it that's as easy as it gets
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.080]   that's how you make CBD or sick sorry
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.200]   c60 CBD crystal oil ah real hard to say anyway
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.440]   that's how you make it it's as simple as that
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.320]   and then all the reasons why and what it costs
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.360]   you know i i really really uh encourage everyone to try this
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.880]   and wait till you try it you'll be amazed it really is kind of cool stuff
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.920]   uh and you know it it kind of for me it does this
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.360]   really well anyway so the last thing i want to share with you is the comparison
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.080]   um i make this stuff at home for myself and for my dog
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.520]   and i went shopping to say you know hey who is there anybody else on planet
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:13.520]   earth right now making a CBD c60 oil and i only found
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.440]   three vendors and one of the vendors it was only a press release
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.720]   that said they were going to make it but if you go to their website
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:24.560]   it's not even for sale yet and so i don't have any numbers on these guys
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.240]   but for canana carbon which is one of the c uh CBD
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:33.120]   oil manufacturers that decided to add c60 to their product which is
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.920]   backwards then you know i'm doing um you know having c60 and then
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:42.000]   getting into cbd so the idea here is that uh and then there's this other
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.880]   company called wild leaf everything's in the video description so you want to
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.000]   check them out um so this is the comparison okay
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:56.080]   canana carbon sells a one ounce bottle of CBD c60 oil they use this 99.90 c60
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.600]   they don't disclose how much c60 is actually in their oil
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.720]   but they do say that there's 125 milligrams of
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:07.520]   CBD in each one ounce and they charge 60 dollars for that little bottle
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.280]   wild leaf hemp is the same thing they don't disclose
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.120]   anything about their uh how much is in what or what purity or any of that stuff
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.520]   on their website and they charge a 119 dollars for that one little bottle
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.960]   okay blue dog hadn't started selling yet and here you go right here this is
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:28.960]   my uh k armor c60 CBD crystal oil you could make it home
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.360]   it only costs 47 dollars and 41 cents compare that to
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.880]   what you can buy and look at the amount of CBD
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.560]   in the oil compared to the one commercial product that that shares
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.080]   that information and then how much c60 is actually in there so
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.840]   you're getting a big bang for the for your buck and it's only 47 bucks
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.880]   compared to what you could buy so if you want to do this
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.880]   you pretty much need to make it yourself to get the best deal so this is it
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:23:01.280]   c60 um CBD crystal oil better faster cheaper
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.560]   thank you very much i really appreciate you guys stopping by
