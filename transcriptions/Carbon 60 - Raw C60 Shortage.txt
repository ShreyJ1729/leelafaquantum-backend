[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another carbon-60 video by me, Kay Elmer and in
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.800]   this video I just wanted to give everyone a status on the situation with
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.680]   the Ross C60 shortage. It is now January 2019 and in my last video when I talked
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.040]   about Ross C60 being sold out I did figure that it'd be about now where
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.080]   things would start getting a lot better and they are and so I just want to walk
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.240]   you through that. Let's get started. Just a few disclaimers on this video. I just
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.320]   want to make sure everyone understands if you're new to me that I don't endorse
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.760]   any products. I don't have a stake in any C60 company. I don't get paid in any
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.640]   way so I just want to make sure that everybody's really clear that the
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.280]   material I put out in my videos is just purely my own research that I just
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.320]   willingly share with others. Alright so there's no bias here. I'm going to
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.000]   mention a lot of different manufacturers and I just want to make sure I have no
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.200]   relationships with any of them so just be real clear with everybody. Alright so
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.440]   here's the status with the six that I mentioned in the sold out video. I just
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.160]   want to point out that I don't talk about the Chinese providers. I do not
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.320]   recommend them. There's been people having issues in the chat room buying
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.320]   whatever they don't know what it is. Some people have gotten good C60 from
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.080]   Chinese suppliers. Other people have gotten like again they don't know what
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.120]   it is. So you know it's so up and down the scale of whether or not it's real
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.400]   that I just absolutely don't think anyone should you know take a chance when
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.480]   you know now that you can get real authentic quality C60 from reputable
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.640]   suppliers so that's I guess in a nutshell. So now with that said these are
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.040]   the six that I talked about in the sold out video. Let's just start with MTR. The
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.560]   status right now is that they are taking a wait list so for the longest time and
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.440]   you all know if you've tried to interact with these guys the process is you email
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.400]   them and then they will email you back with confirmation and you pay them but
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.960]   for the longest time I've got like you know half a dozen emails to them since
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.800]   September and they just weren't answering emails so obviously they were flooded
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.680]   and and they just didn't get to them. So now they put out a new email to all of
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.600]   the folks on the wait list on their email list I'm sorry saying that hey you
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.840]   know we're doing a wait list and we're gonna start shipping January. Redline is
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.240]   in the same boat somewhat they decided to build their own reactor. It comes
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.800]   online now it actually came online on Tuesday and they say they're gonna now
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.880]   start producing C60 themselves and they're gonna start hitting their
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.000]   back orders. Now the red line is a little different you had to pay them in
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.280]   advance that they had you know they've been holding the money obviously they've
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.040]   invested it into this all-new equipment and they're gonna start producing with
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.560]   their new reactor and they're gonna start shipping this month as well. Now
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.480]   Bucky Labs and Piers C60 olive oil have C64 sale now. Bucky's got a note on their
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.800]   website it starts shipping on January 10th Piers C60 olive oil you can just
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.080]   order it and they'll just take you know just like any other day and they'll
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.520]   send it to you there and so those guys are good and then of course SES research
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.920]   which is the largest SCC producer in the country. Their website said that's
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.880]   out of stock but they are selling it by invitation they're selling very small
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.960]   quantities a half a gram or one gram at a time by invitation and then you have
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.440]   to be on their mailing list to get that invite. And then Solaris Cam is the
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.160]   Canadian company and they still report a back order of three months. So let's get
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.040]   into the detail because I think that's it's pretty interesting. Now this email
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.000]   there's these two emails right here the one on the left is really just about two
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.040]   weeks ago where MTR put out an email to their email list and so you know if
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.360]   you're into this and this is your thing like I don't know if you're into it as
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.560]   much as I am. But if you're into C60 and you're in you're making it and you know
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.840]   get on everybody's email list because you don't hear about this stuff otherwise
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.160]   you know either through my video or getting an email because you're not
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.200]   going to see this on the website. So they just basically MTR says we would
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.640]   like to inform that you according to our great demand on Global Market for a C60
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.000]   products and they're specifically they're doing it a sublime that's a very
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.280]   unique way of creating C60 or synthesizing it you know creating an
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.960]   extracting C60 from a carbon source. So they do it via a process called sublime.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.720]   It is the most difficult and most costly way to do it but you also come out with
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.400]   the highest quality product. Now they are selling now they said basically is
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.840]   that they've opened up in January additional production lines and now they
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:35.480]   can supply their customers according to the waiting list a sublime C60 at 99.99%
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:42.520]   and these are the prices that they're quoting 1 gram 195 2 grams 185 3 5
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.440]   you know and so forth in the price gets a little bit lower as you go. So they
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.360]   put out a notice two weeks ago that they're gonna kick off a new production
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.320]   line start really putting out some C60 gave out the prices and basically said
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.400]   get on their waiting list. Apparently if you were already trying to email them
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.920]   you're not on they just probably dumped that and starting off a new list. So I
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.760]   emailed them right away said hey I want to get on your list put me down for X
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.560]   amount and then emailed me like literally the next day they emailed me dear Mr.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.560]   Elmer. Thank you for email your email according to your request you are on the
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.640]   waiting list and we will inform you about your order availability. So that's
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.880]   where it stands. They're actually emailing back that's like oh wow they
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.440]   finally emailed me back after all these months so so apparently they're
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.520]   they're you know this is real they're taking over they're starting a waiting
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.520]   list they start shipping these are the prices and it's working you know MTR is
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.520]   back up and they'll start putting out product this month. Now Red Lion pretty
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.080]   much the same thing which is coincidentally they sent out an email this
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.240]   week this prior week and they said hey the reactor will be built Tuesday they've
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.320]   got the engineering firm and they're working on the whole thing blah blah blah
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.040]   and then basically you know this is they're they're running their first set of
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.200]   batches so they're not expecting to get 99% C60 so they expect to be able to
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.560]   get and of course they're emphasizing they don't use solvent so they're this
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.840]   email is basically saying hey we we're they think they're gonna be producing
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:13.680]   99.5% C60 the other five point I'm sorry 0.5% being C70 they're saying their
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.720]   first few batches will probably be that level quality as they you know iron out
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.520]   the kinks and so now they're just saying hey we decided to offer these
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.360]   initial 99.5 batches to people who want it so now they have a back order list as
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.000]   I mentioned and so if you're on that back order list you got this email and
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.080]   and if you're not you know anyway and they're offering anybody that wants the
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.520]   99 in place of the 99.99 that that we had ordered and so some people are taking
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.840]   them up on it other people are waiting and then there's actual people that are
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.160]   kind of like you know negotiating and saying well you know take some of it
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.360]   that way and I'll wait for the rest and you know so you know they're just
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.880]   basing letting everybody know hey they're online and probably by next month
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.120]   they'll be shipping out their regular products and so everybody who's back
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.320]   order will probably be getting it in a couple of months or so so that's looking
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.920]   really good as well of course Bucky Labs as I mentioned is shipping and they're
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.480]   basically saying that it says story out of you know sorry out of stock but they
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.960]   ship you know begin shipping January 10 now people on the chat room have said
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.400]   that they've ordered from Bucky and they got it like in three weeks so you know
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.880]   that's like a no-brainer there they're selling it right now pure 66 olive oil
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.880]   is the only place that you can just order it and get it like you would they
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.040]   even right here they even advertise on Amazon and so that's their 99.95 not
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.400]   not sublime not 99.99 it just this is your kind of like this is actually the
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.120]   baseline a lot almost all of the producers that you if you buy the oil
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.440]   product they make it with the 99.95 so that's kind of like the standard 99.99
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.320]   is you know for people who just want to go up a notch to the highest quality
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.240]   possible you know but this is normal nothing to be worried about and this is
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.080]   what they're selling it at so this vendor is actively selling it and you
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.200]   can get it on Amazon now for SES they this is off their website they're
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.280]   still saying they're currently out of stock but by their C60 olive oil and so
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.640]   what's interesting I want to point out is Dustin Nemo he's a great guy he's
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.640]   part of our chat group and he does his own little YouTube channel and so he
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.280]   interviewed Chris Burris of SES about two weeks ago SES this is the like the
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.720]   they had marketing guy there and and one of the founding scientists and so and
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.080]   basically it's a really good interesting interview to listen to link in the
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.240]   video descriptions below where you know the two he basically interviewed Chris
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.640]   and asked him all about it so Chris basically said hey you know right now
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.720]   they're diverting all of their production into making oil and there and
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.720]   he basically did mention that he is selling the small grams I've actually
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.960]   seen those little by invitation offers and so that's how I know what the price
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.280]   is but that's basically how that's working right now they're just not
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.080]   selling to the little guy unless you get an invite and they're really pushing
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.640]   the olive oil product and I just kind of want to point out something interesting
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.600]   as well you know here's pure C60 olive oil this is their their
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.520]   advertisement right off their website and if you look right down here it just
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.720]   is manufactured in Houston Texas so you go to Bucky or pure and and they
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.920]   pretty much are not making it themselves their websites don't talk about that I
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.400]   think this is my personal opinion is that there's they're basically one of the
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.920]   big customers of SES research and they're just reselling it and so it seems to
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:30.400]   me really that SES has decided to not really cater to the mom and pops you
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.720]   know purely business decision no problem there and they're selling to the major
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.120]   manufacturers who are reselling their product and or making all the oil products
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.400]   out of it so that's that's just their mode of business right now so it kind of
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.640]   just seems like they're gone into the wholesale business and so that's a
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.200]   development that's happened in the last few months now in terms of Solaris
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.440]   chem that's the Canadian company nothing has changed with these guys this is the
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.720]   exact same notice that was on their website three months ago and it just
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.480]   says hey depending on what you want expect a one to three month delay on
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.520]   back orders and they'll get to you when they can get to you okay so that's the
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:10.360]   status of the six so as of now the price the prices that are being quoted and
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.400]   this is the best I could get these are the only prices you can find on the
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:20.560]   internet which is MTR saying 195 for 99.99 there are these three vendors here
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:26.720]   are selling 99.95 I'm sorry this is wrong I'm gonna just put this over here and I
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.680]   want to start their video over again let me just make that correction and okay
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:36.480]   so it's 99.99 red line is 73 a gram this is per gram and you have to it's
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.160]   either purchasing one or two so you buy the smallest amount possible and this is
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.120]   your price so red line still is by far I mean the the price on their website
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.520]   today it may go up I don't know I haven't spoken to them but you know it's
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.440]   definitely a pretty awesome price MTR out there but MTR is a sublime red
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:59.000]   line is not but and red line is non solvent so you know and everybody's got
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.320]   a little bit of a difference there but still a good price but I'm thinking you
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:07.680]   order with red line it may take longer than ordering it from MTR now in terms of
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.360]   Bucky Labs these are the two prices Bucky's at 180 220 from pure and then you got
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.080]   SES is now the SES this price right here I got that from those invitations
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:23.400]   they're selling like a half a gram at 169 so one gram is 338 so you can just
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.480]   see you know they really you could just tell I mean I was thinking as from a
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.440]   business perspective if I was SES and I had a whole bunch of customers and I
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.720]   got like maybe 10% of them buying bulk so I've got let's say a kilogram to
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:42.200]   ship out well do I want to send out 10 or 5 shipments today or do I want to
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.880]   send out a hundred little shipments and you know it's just common sense they
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.120]   you know catering to the mom and pops is really not their thing so they bumped
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.640]   the price up and took it off the website and they're doing everything you can
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:12:01.320]   tell to avoid mom and pop so I'm one of them anyway and then Solaris Kim you get
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.040]   on their three month back order and it's 269 at 99 this is in fact the only
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.760]   price they put on their website is 499 to it's 269 grams so you can see that
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:16.360]   right now the the market prices are kind of all over the map I expect that
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.280]   once everybody is shipping all of this will kind of you know even out and they'll
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.960]   be like you know some kind of a you know an average but right now it is all
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.120]   over the scale depending on how soon you can get at the prices very etc anyway
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.000]   that's it I just wanted to share that with you that seems to be the common
