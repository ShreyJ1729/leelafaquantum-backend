[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host,
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.680]   Kay Elmer, and this video is another installment in the video series. Welcome to
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.600]   Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.640]   In this video, I'll be discussing the idea of stacking modalities with Philip Von
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.040]   Holtzendorf, the owner operator of Layla Q, in which we'll be discussing
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.920]   the combining of quantum upgrade and devices and/or combining devices
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.360]   for people who have questions about, you know, are they beneficial? You know, how do
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.960]   you do that or why would you do that? We're also going to discuss
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.120]   charging other energy devices. So a lot of you folks that are attracted to
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.320]   Layla Quantum Tech obviously own other things in the energy world and so
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.920]   we go and discuss that. We'll also be discussing using multiple blocks
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.600]   simultaneously for distance healing, as well as using multiple blocks
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.360]   in terms and towards manifesting for particular outcomes. So enjoy this clip
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.160]   and here you go. The other issue on quantum that comes up quite a bit is
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.920]   this idea of stacking modalities, right? And so that's
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.760]   the question of and what I mean by using a combination of devices and quantum
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.040]   upgrade. So the first question is, is like, that it
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.320]   comes up a lot is, if I have a block, do I need
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.720]   upgrade or what would upgrade do that would be, you know, like a, you know, a
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.320]   level up, you know, or vice versa? If I have upgrade, you know, what would
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.520]   the wearing a capsule do? The other question is, is, you know, what
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.000]   if I do them both at the same time? So, you know, so when you start stacking
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.840]   these things, what's your recommendation for that specific? Let's
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.080]   start with the first question, which is, if I have one, what would the other one
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.880]   do for me? What's your, what are your thoughts?
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.520]   So if you have a block, what would the other block do? Or if I have a block
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.880]   thing, yeah, it's a quantum upgrade do for me. That applies for everything. So it's
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.320]   people with one block, should I get another one, right? If I have a capsule,
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.160]   what would a block do, you know, and not, you know, just do for me.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.080]   Same thing with if I have upgrade, what, and I get a block or a lot of it's like
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.840]   people who have blocks and capsules, wondering, you know, what would the
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.320]   upgrade do for me if I had all this others, if I have this stuff already,
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.240]   you know, so because like, if I, if I add more, right, that's the
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.680]   question. If I add more, is there more benefits?
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.400]   To a specific point, there is. So I mean, we have blocks, we have the quantum
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:35.040]   upgrade, and I wouldn't want to turn any of these things off, right? So if I have
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.120]   just the quantum upgrade for you, for example, for me, so we have to get into
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.640]   specifics here, right? Because there's no general answer, unfortunately.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.520]   So if I had that quantum upgrade for me, then that's sufficient in terms of
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.880]   EMF mitigation for myself, for the frequencies I want to have for myself,
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.400]   and all of that, right? A block couldn't really add anything to that.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.000]   Now, if I have an elbow injury, I put that elbow in the block, though, because that's
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.960]   a very targeted treatment, and it may have a very powerful field, right? So now I
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:25.200]   also have this super block at home, but which will make available, hopefully in
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.640]   January, I think, but that would be something where I can still add
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.040]   juice and targeting, right? And then there are all these other things that I
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.240]   can do with the block that I cannot do with quantum upgrade. We've talked about those
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.360]   many times, right? You can charge water, you can charge foods and all of that.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:56.640]   So having a block and then having another block, what does that do? Well, I can,
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.040]   because the block is the most powerful inside, and then it has a field. If you have two blocks at
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:10.720]   home or three, you can put them in different locations in the home, and in general, you
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:19.760]   up-level the density of the quantum energy fields at home, right? And you can also create
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:28.480]   a larger radius with that. So, yeah, that's certainly beneficial. Up to a point where,
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:37.120]   if you have too many and too much, then it's just too much, right? But yeah, if you, I mean,
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:46.240]   we haven't seen anything. Four blocks at a home is no issue whatsoever. I think above that,
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.360]   it feels to us, unless it's a mansion, it becomes a little bit too much.
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.400]   Okay, no, that makes sense. That makes sense. Okay, so that, I just, yeah, I wanted to just
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.720]   touch on that, because that question comes up all the time. So, it's all about how you want to use
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.840]   it. It's all about how much energy you want to have in your home and your life and so forth.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.360]   Okay, no, that makes sense. The other question that comes up about stacking modalities is,
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.680]   this comes up all the time. People have all these different things that they've, we're all
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.880]   attracted to this energy stuff, right? So, because you're in that mindset, people have
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.280]   things like, let me just example, that's an anolema wand. And somebody the other day was asking,
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.680]   you know, hey, should I charge my anolema wand? And my immediate answer was, no, you don't want
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.960]   to mess with it, because anolema by itself is very special. And you may not want to change it.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.240]   And, you know, but you're, I would like to get your take. What happens? And, and, and do you think
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.840]   it's a good thing for people to charge their other energy devices that they have, you know,
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.360]   that they have in their possession? Is it beneficial? Should people be doing it? Because
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.240]   these other things are, are special all on their own? Should they just like, not do that and let
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.560]   them be what they are? And, you know, it's kind of like homeopathic, you don't want to mess with that.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.600]   I mean, what are your thoughts on charging other energy devices?
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:15.520]   From all what we've seen and observed so far, the blogs make every other product better.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.640]   Okay. And it doesn't interfere with the
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:26.400]   energy levels or electromagnetic levels that these devices work on.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:36.160]   So yes, I would charge them personally. And we can't tell you for each and every device, you know,
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:43.440]   what exactly the, the gain may be. But since an anolema, for example, doesn't work with quantum
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.920]   energy, yeah, be certainly a good thing if you, if you added that.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:55.280]   Okay. All right. You know, specific to that, would you recommend charging the wand itself or
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.160]   just charging the water after you make it? I was thinking, I would think, I would think the water,
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.800]   I would charge the water 100 percent. Yeah, because my, yeah, my opinion is, you know,
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.680]   it's like, anolema is really special. I wouldn't mess with the wand, but I would totally, I charge
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.400]   all my water. So I would make the water right and put that frequency in there and then charge it.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.280]   And that way I've got the best of both worlds. That was just my idea.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:24.960]   Yeah. Okay. Now the other one that comes up is using multiple devices simultaneously.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.200]   So what this means is, is that, you know, like right now we've got the, we've got a, you know,
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.400]   like a splinter telegram groups now that, you know, members have created. One of them is called
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.440]   quantum healing, where they're doing, you know, basically distance healing, kind of following
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:46.400]   the Lynn Taggart model, right? And they're, and one of the things that I kind of remember from it,
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.960]   a while back when we had a situation, we've had a couple of situations where we had to get you
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:57.520]   involved, where people were trying to assist a specific person, but they were like multiple
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.160]   blocks were being used at the same time. And I recall back then you were telling me that,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.600]   and then I just want to clarify if this is still accurate because it was like a couple of years
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.960]   ago, but is if you're trying to help somebody or a pet, you know, and you have the picture in the
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:17.120]   block, right? Does it make any difference if you use, if somebody else with another block does the
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:23.120]   same thing? Is it like, does it stack on top of each other? So if I use two blocks, it's better
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:29.200]   than using one or, you know, or not, you know, what are your thoughts on using, you know, doing that,
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:36.320]   you know, with more than one block? That's a good question. And if it's the exact same block with
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:42.080]   the exact same strength, and there's nothing done in addition, like adding frequencies, etc,
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.880]   then there is no additional effect. Ah, okay. So that's still the same. Okay.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.840]   So it's still the same. That is what we found. And yeah, it's, we've really
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:09:01.840]   looked into this deeply. And there's no other effect. But as soon as you add the heal frequency
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:08.800]   in one, for example, or you have a more powerful one, then obviously then you have
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:15.200]   even more effects. Okay. So let's say if in that quantum healing group,
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.200]   one of those members has the super ground block, this brand new one that hasn't been
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.560]   released yet. If they have that guy, is does everybody else not need to do anything? Because
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.800]   you've got one, you know, that you literally have the strongest block, and you've got the picture in
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.880]   the block. So if somebody had a quantum block, you know, it wouldn't make any difference. I mean,
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.880]   it wouldn't add any benefit, right? So you don't, you only need to use the one block,
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.240]   you know, like whoever's got the strongest block, correct. So the photo in that one,
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.240]   everybody else, you don't need to do it. Would that be the best approach? Okay. Yeah.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.440]   All right. That makes sense. That's what I was thinking. All right. So there you go, guys.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.800]   No. Yeah. And if you, if we still get to this one question that we talked about initially,
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.760]   that, you know, wasn't in regards to the storm and everything. Yeah, that's where there are ways
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:06.400]   where you can actually amplify by using multiple blocks together. Okay. But that would be a,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.360]   that's a thing of intention, and then probably also even
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.800]   distance, actual physical proximity. Yeah. This is where, yeah, this is the quote
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.680]   under the stacking modalities. But, you know, Philip and I had a discussion right before the,
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:31.280]   I started recording about Hurricane Milton, Philip lives near Orlando. So Philip, can you describe
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:37.040]   how you stacked different modalities together, you know, different block owners and so forth,
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:43.600]   and upgrade to, you know, kind of protect your, your, your area? Can you kind of describe what
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.000]   you did? And how did you go about doing that for other people to kind of learn from it and,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.680]   and try it themselves? Yep. So first of all, so we have very powerful blocks in our home.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.840]   Then I have obviously the quantum upgrade for myself, you know, our son has it,
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:14.000]   our dog has it. We have not had it for the home slash location yet, but we checked and before this
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.840]   hurricane, it was the right thing to do to also add it for the home location to make the field
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.200]   even stronger. So we did that. That was the first thing we did. And then we checked. Okay.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:33.600]   So what else is necessary? And there are probably about, I would say 15 to 20 blocks in the
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:41.440]   Winter Park Orlando area of people that we know of. The person that we know
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:48.320]   somehow personally and or through in direct, most of them actually in direct. And
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:57.120]   we informed everyone to put if they feel that this is right for them, of course,
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:05.280]   to put two intentions into the block. One was, you know, basically, my home is safe
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:11.120]   and protected. So that I'm not talking about my personal home. Now I'm talking about each
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:23.840]   individual's home. And then also that all these blocks in this area connect to protective dome
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:33.920]   or protective shield. I think that's what we called it, right? And I think that in a
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.320]   nutshell, pretty much those two things. And then certainly we told everyone also to
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:45.200]   get into very positive vibes in terms of, yes, we're fully protected, that they feel that
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:51.040]   also personally and not get into the fear, right? Because you don't want fear vibrations that.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:13:00.000]   And we know that there's there's a person in Asheville or in the Asheville area that's in the
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.360]   quantum upgrade group. And she had posted or reached out actually to us that
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.680]   she had a travel block at home and the quantum upgrade. And her home was the only home that
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:19.120]   wasn't damaged. And all of her neighbor homes were washed away, completely damaged all of that. So
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.800]   that that's certainly a good thing. And we can now say, thankfully, that in the Winter Park and
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:31.840]   Orlando area, nothing major happened at all. And as a matter of fact, the core of the storm,
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:39.520]   which was supposed to go right through it, actually ended up going about 30 miles south of it, 30,
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:47.200]   40 miles south. So right, obviously, this is not scientific at all whatsoever. But we did all of
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:53.280]   our magic ahead of time to check what is that we can do, what is it that we're allowed to do.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:00.320]   And that's what we did. And, you know, we can just say it all worked. And everyone felt safe
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.680]   and safer and is pretty happy with the outcome.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:09.600]   Oh, that's amazing. I mean, it's really amazing. So two intentions. One is you're, you know,
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:15.040]   keep my, you know, my home is safe. And the second one is connect, right? She formed the forma shield.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:21.360]   Okay. All right. So definitely could use your intentions using your blocks, upgrade location,
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:28.160]   so forth. So yeah, that's a, that's a, that's a great story. And so what would other people outside
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:34.080]   of that region also, because a lot of people were asking earlier this week after seeing what happened
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.880]   with Hurricane Helene, asking, you know, what can we do to help, you know, Florida, you know,
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:45.200]   you know, people in Florida with this upcoming other hurricane, you know, and so basically the
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.080]   recommendation was, you know, use your intentions, right? Put an intention in the block for the,
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.240]   for those people for that region. Is that yeah, and the free gift products, you know,
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:00.080]   use your free gift products for your friends in Florida or tell them, hey, you know, sign up
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:07.600]   for a free trial, you know, and even if those people don't want to continue, right? But maybe at least
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   do a free trial, you know, for seven, 15 days, maybe they, you know, during that time, they
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.400]   actually also really feel it then, right? But hey, you don't have to, you don't lose anything by
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:25.120]   doing your trial during that time and, and, and, you know, having a bubble around your home,
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:30.400]   you know, to tell you it's, it's, it's in the end of the day, it's all vibration. That's what
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:38.000]   people are starting to grasp, obviously, the people that listen to your videos, you know, they, they
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.280]   either totally get it already, or they're, they're quite there, you know, it's all about vibration.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:50.480]   And if I have a very positive vibration and resonance, I don't suck in the negative, right? So
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:57.600]   it's all about that. Okay, perfect. That's actually a great idea. So, yep, that, okay,
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.000]   that's how you basically, because, you know, there's more hurricanes probably coming over the next,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.240]   you know, whatever forever. So that's definitely a good idea, a good way to help
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.600]   areas that you want to help, and then basically, particularly your, you and your loved ones home.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.320]   So yeah, thanks. That's a great recommendation. And I'm really glad that you guys are safe out
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:21.200]   there. And it was real kind of interesting to actually watch the hurricane steer south away
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.600]   from your shield. You know, I know it's not scientific, but it's, it's, it's interesting.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:31.200]   Thanks for that. Okay. All right. Well, there you go. So thank you very much for watching the video
