[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and this video is part three in the series
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.220]   Tinkering with quantum blocks now. This is just for you Leila quantum tech
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.920]   Block owners on ways you could use your blocks in different ways that you know
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.660]   You probably hadn't thought about or you might be even doing it already
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.660]   So what I've tried to do is come up with a whole bunch of different ideas on things you could use with your blocks
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.920]   To manifest in tension to send positive energy
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.320]   Etc to whatever you put in that block and that block
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.600]   You know
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.560]   It could be just simply putting in the block and having it you know
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.940]   radiate into the field that you're living in or you can actually put a photo of somebody in there or their name and birthday and
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.600]   Put that in the block on our piece of paper and then put it
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.080]   You know, whatever that item is and then send that energy or that frequency in that vibration to that person through quantum entanglement
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.520]   That's one of the magical things about these blocks is they're incredibly versatile in
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.680]   Using it for healing and manifesting and that's just something that you know
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.440]   You've spent so much money on these things
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.800]   And so what I've been trying to do is come up with every possible idea to kind of give you you know
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.240]   Ways you could really leverage having your block and so just want to do a real quick recap in part one
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.480]   You know I talked about bio geometry signatures and using that with your block
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.840]   And then of course with energy balancing by the numbers, which is a Lord Lloyd Mears thing where he's just kind of converted
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.720]   You know frequencies into numbers same thing with the number sequences by Gregory grab a boy
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.920]   And then of course using mantras now
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.420]   There's a tutorial in the middle here where I was actually talking about how to capture
[00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:47.240]   Resident frequencies, so you know, it's a sound frequencies like the sulfegio tones right or the no-gere frequencies or the right frequencies
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.800]   or the Holland frequencies and you actually capture these these these resonant frequencies tones
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.680]   And you could capture that in water and use that with your block, but then an actual part two of the series
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.560]   You know I talked about imprinting water capturing actual sounds not not frequencies
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.240]   But sounds like whale sounds and you know whale songs
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.880]   And you know just you know bees buzzing and all of these different things even cat purr, you know has this the healing effect
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.440]   And so you know talked about that in part two by the way
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.520]   There's gonna be links to everything in the video description and then the rest of part two was you know
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.480]   Talking about some crazy ideas. I had about creating patches and of course getting copies of your loved ones
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.840]   You know vibrational frequency and how important that was to me
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.880]   So now this is part three and so we're gonna I'm gonna share with you six more ideas that I had
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.760]   That I wanted to kind of just convey to you that you know here's something to think about
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.840]   And you know and to use with your block. So let's go ahead and talk about each one of these things one at a time
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.600]   So the first thing I wanted to talk about was you know
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.520]   And this is just a you know going back to part one about mantras at the time. I just was sharing one of the
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.680]   Something that the one of the Leila quantum tech healer network
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.040]   Healers had actually kind of you know sent out on his Facebook post about about what he was working on at the time
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.920]   And I thought that was a great idea. I shared that in that video
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.520]   But then I've since you know kind of been looking around and collecting information
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.280]   And I found a really great book called healing mantras
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.320]   And so now in this book and you know links to everything in the video description, but in this book
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.720]   It's really kind of cool
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.600]   Where if you get this book, you know, you really kind of get into it
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.920]   And you can kind of take a look at all of the different other healing mantras more than just the agni
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.800]   You know healing mantra that I did share which I think was potting roof or something. I'm sorry
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.960]   But in this book right here if you go into the book and you go, it's like, you know
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.080]   It's a big book
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.640]   But if you go into the back into the back you actually get into the actual
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.880]   Mantras and health and obviously a lot of the things that we want to do our health related
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.400]   And or just bringing in, you know, you know, you know positive vibrations into our living space
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.680]   But you know here's right here. We're basically in the book, you know, honor honor about I don't know what pages is
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:11.340]   Yeah 117 it really gets into the actual like, you know, fibromyalgia healing success and actual, you know, mantras
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.840]   You're healing mantras for those specific types of issues. So I won't even try to pronounce this
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.040]   But it's you know, here's the pronunciation key right here
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.160]   But you can see where this book actually contains a lot of different mantras for specific different things
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.240]   So I can kind of jump back up to the table of contents to kind of show you what the choices are
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.760]   And then you can kind of just, you know, mastering fear
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.580]   Mantras for health
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.700]   Mantras for anger and under other undesirable inner conditions
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.160]   Mantras for abundance and prosperity
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.920]   Self-empowerment, you know, and that sort of thing
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.760]   So I definitely want to kind of just expand on that idea with this reference for you
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.000]   So this book right here is really helpful and gives you a lot of different mantras
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.480]   You could probably and or maybe want to use, you know with your block
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.280]   Okay, and then the next thing I want to chat about is something I should actually just put in part one
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.160]   Because this is the very first thing that a lot of people do is you know, they're manifesting intentions
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.640]   And so, you know, you could there's tons and tons of videos on YouTube on how to do that
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.160]   But here's just kind of like you're down and you know
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.480]   Your quick list of of you know, if you're gonna manifest intentions the the thing is it's you know, it's not like you're
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.640]   It's not it's kind of like wishing but it's a little bit different
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.440]   But the whole idea though is you know, you want to write something down
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.440]   And you want to speak it out loud when you place it in the block, but you want to be clear
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.080]   You want to visualize
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.440]   Visualize is really really important to manifesting, you know, and then to help it helps to practice gratitude using your
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.880]   Affirmations practice mindfulness embracing your challenges
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.800]   Setting your intentions, you know, helping you control your life and then choosing it intentions for you and keep in mind
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.400]   When manifesting intentions and again, this video is not about how to do it
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.440]   I'm just covering it as a bullet point saying hey, this is a good thing to use with your blocks
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.800]   But the whole idea though is to keep in mind that when manifesting intentions, you know, visualization is
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:20.000]   Really important being very clear wearing being very specific and also to keeping in mind that whatever you're you're looking to kind of manifest
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.040]   You know, does it or does it not fall into your divine path, right?
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.680]   And and that's the thing we all have a divine path some people call it fate, you know
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.800]   And whether you believe in it or not, you know, it kind of kind of is well how the world works
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.440]   And so one of the things to you know about divine path is that if it's not meant to be
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.920]   Then it's just not gonna happen
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.680]   You know, but if it is meant to be this nudges it along and helps you kind of narrow down
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.720]   You know, what's happening in terms of intentions to kind of help you along with that and so now there's
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.440]   There's no book of intentions because everybody's gonna create their own
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.560]   But if you're interested one of the things that I did do
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.320]   Is that you know, for those of you who hang out with me and in my other telegram chat groups
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.900]   You'll know that I have quite an extensive library
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:17.040]   Curated over a couple of decades and so one of the things in my in my library that I'm more than happy to share with all of you
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.880]   And link in the video description is that you know
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.600]   There's a a course work that was done by Dr
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.480]   Wayne Dyer if you remember him and so now it was called manifesting your destiny
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.680]   And I actually have a copy of the whole thing and so you can kind of you know
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.480]   So here you go. You can use this if you want to learn more about manifesting
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.720]   But one of the things that you can kind of do is just kind of like listen to this. It's all on CDs
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   But what I'd like to do here is
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.880]   Basically, you have you imagine how to manifest that you're in a room, right?
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.200]   And so it's all just it's just copies of CDs. You can see there's a whole bunch of it
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.280]   It's the entire coursework that he offered back in the day
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.200]   And it kind of just helps for anyone who's not used to you know how to do intentions
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:04.080]   You know, that's actually a question we get a lot in the telegram chat group. So here you go. Click on the link take
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.640]   Oh, you know, take a listen pick your different topic. There's tons and tons of topics in here
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.280]   You know seeing yourself as someone within story of manifesting how we say, you know, and it just goes on and on
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.200]   So you I'm more than happy to share this with you to help teach you how to manifest
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   And this is your your quick bullet list of what to focus in on and the more you do it and
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.160]   The better you're gonna get at it
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:32.680]   So definitely manifesting intentions writing stuff down and being mindful and putting that that vibration into your block
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.680]   Either, you know, like just by you know, again, just buy your block itself
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.360]   Manifesting it so that it comes within the field for yourself or using photos
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:49.960]   Works wonderfully. There's so many positive stories on our telegram chat groups for Leila quantum tech about people doing this and having
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:55.240]   Great results. So definitely, you know, using intentions is a real big deal
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.680]   And it's a great tinker for your block. The next one here is using energy medicine symbols
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.480]   Now this is right along the same alley as bio geometry
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:13.200]   Signature's, which is basically really gifted people also different healers and and actually, you know, like that guy was a scientist
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.880]   But you know the idea is that you know
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:23.500]   There's all these sacred symbols that have kind of been discovered or rediscovered by various different energy healers and
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.160]   clairvoyants like grab a boy was a clairvoyant and instead of using symbols, you know
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.360]   He translated what he was seeing as like abundance equals these numbers, right?
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.320]   And so that kind of thing so you can use more symbols
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:42.000]   So if you're interested and you've been doing bio geometry signatures, you might want to look at energy medicine symbols
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.360]   You know, it's the same concept
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.920]   And so there's a couple of really good books here on
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.600]   Symbols that you could actually just print right out and then put it in your block
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:56.840]   And there's symbols for everything you can imagine for you know getting over your anxiety for fertility for, you know
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.760]   Love, you know, for abundance prosperity
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.720]   Etc, and so I want to kind of just turn you on to these two books
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:09.800]   You know for abundant symbols and energy medicine symbols now Joanne Huntsman is a is an English
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:16.920]   Energy healer lives in England and she's come up with in her work with her with her patience. She's come up with an entire
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.240]   Set of symbols that she's created you get the book you get there's a download URL
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.920]   You can download all the different symbols and then she shows you how to use it with you know
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.600]   She's got her own protocol her own methodology for, you know, using her medicine symbols
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.240]   And so there's just another way of kind of like leveraging
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:43.760]   Symbology because you know our world and all the ancients are all about sacred symbols and and these symbols are have powerful vibrations
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.520]   It's just how the world is, you know, and so the ancients knew all about this and now of course
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:54.460]   There's you know, it's it's part of our world today if you know where to look so these come from some real interesting
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:01.120]   healers in the world and they basically this is what they've come up with so if you want to do more on symbology
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.480]   Then here's a couple of books that I recommend that you could kind of take a look at to see, you know
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.400]   If that's something you want to try yourself or just to tinker with it, you know
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:14.440]   The next thing of course are more symbols are the Reiki symbols now in the world of Reiki
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.840]   It's it's basically energy healing, but they they use some, you know some use stones and some use
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.320]   Symbols and so you can kind of do both so one of the things about the well
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:30.760]   Here's the abundance symbol and the energy symbol, but then you get into the book of Reiki and let's see
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.460]   This is a giant book. It's five hundred seventy one pages. So if I kind of scoop down
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.120]   At the two I wrote notes to myself, but there's so much in this book
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:45.880]   But if you get down to like page 238 if I can get to it yeah, oh down in here
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.880]   So you get down into this area here
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.080]   I'm gonna just keep going that's one eighty seven. I wanted to show you the example here we go
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.680]   So you get into this area right here and you start getting into the actual symbols and what they mean
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.520]   So you basically what I would do is just print this page out, you know
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.920]   And here's the symbol and this is the SHK symbol. I don't know how to pronounce that
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.840]   you know this right here, but basically the
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:17.240]   In Reiki the main function of the SHK symbol is for mental healing
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:25.080]   Right, and then it's on and on and on all these different symbols and what they're for and what the energy healers are using these symbols for and
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.720]   Basically, they're using symbols like you would use crystals in their energy work
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.360]   And so it's just another symbol just like bio geometry just like energy medicine
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.080]   But you know just to let you know hey Reiki has its own
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.200]   Set of symbols that they use in their energy work and there's quite powerful
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.280]   I mean there's a lot of different Reiki healers out there and they do quite amazing work
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:52.160]   If you've ever worked with one of these energy healers now the next one obviously is you know again one more time
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.720]   mandalas, you know mandalas are you know, I guess they're
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:01.680]   Well, I guess you could call them symbols. I don't really look at symbols as the same as mandalas mandalas
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:07.120]   Kind of have a different thing going on, but it's the same thing. You could you know basically taking a
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.240]   Diagram, you know or taking a symbol
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.840]   Placing that in your block so that it that's because that symbol has a sacred
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:24.000]   Vibration to it and so then that vibration then of whatever that symbol represents and in this case a mandala
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.440]   Which is you know, I get there differentiating between symbols and mandala, but mandalas are kind of like symbols, right?
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.200]   But then the idea though is a separate category
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.360]   So taking mandalas and what are all the different mandalas?
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.960]   And so here's a great book called healing mandalas that you that I'm recommending that if you're gonna want to take a peek at
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.680]   And I have a copy of this and it's in my library
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.120]   And so you kind of go into this guy and you kind of say well
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.120]   What are all the different mandalas that are available and so you kind of just kind of zip through this book
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:59.560]   It's kind of a it's only hundred sixty four pages, but you get into some of these different mandalas and that gets into the meaning
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:06.200]   Of what these mandalas, you know represent and what they kind of bring out in terms of what their vibrations are
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.840]   And so there's all these different choices again with like just like with symbols
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.720]   It's like if you can think it up
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:18.200]   It's you're gonna find either a symbol or you're gonna find a mandala that's gonna represent what you want to manifest
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:25.160]   And so you can kind of like up your gain by not only just like let's say you want to you're working on breaking shackles
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.960]   You know the guys the stuff in life is holding you back
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.880]   That's just an example and so you find you know
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:36.640]   You write an intention to you know kind of free up yourself or free yourself from whatever is holding you back
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:42.560]   And then you would print out this mandala and you kind of just up your game by not only having an intention in there
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:48.840]   But you're putting in a symbol a sacred symbol or mandala along with that intention into your block
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:54.960]   To then manifest that into the field or entangle it to whatever you're trying to send it to you
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.640]   So I look at it like, you know, hey, it's one more thing
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.720]   I'm a tinker and I just tinker away
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:06.160]   But that's a a really good idea that I recommend that you give it a try along with symbols
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.280]   Mandalas, you know, and that's very mantras
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.280]   But there's all these different things, right?
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:17.640]   And then the last one that I really want to share with you for this video for part three is the use of stones and crystals
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:22.240]   And again, you know kind of like, you know, smack myself on that because you know, this is such a no-brainer
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.520]   It should have been in part one
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:31.800]   but I didn't really think about how incredibly potent and how incredibly wonderful
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:40.360]   Using the frequencies of different stones and crystals would be until we had that pain management frequency contest earlier in this year
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:49.160]   You know 2024 and so one of the items or one of the molecular frequencies in the pain management frequency that won the contest
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.960]   out of 80 different or 70 or 80 different
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:16:01.560]   participants was, you know, the person who won it included the frequency of jade and jade has the frequency of
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:09.520]   Basically, you know helping with, you know, pain and so that person added that frequency and they won the contest
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.520]   Now here's the little tip that I haven't shared with anybody yet
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:18.680]   But in the sleep and rest contest when Layla quantum tech had the second contest this year
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:26.120]   To who could come up with the best frequency for sleep and rest and the frequencies are judged by the Layla healer network
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.760]   So it's not just one healer, but all of them kind of, you know work with the frequency
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:34.240]   And so what was is I was one of the tie for first place
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:40.760]   And so I tied for first place with another individual and our two both were really really good
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.480]   According, you know, I'll talk with Philip out and he said both of these were really really powerful
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:51.240]   You know frequencies for sleep and rest and then when they combine the two first place ones
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:58.920]   It was even stronger than each one of them separate so they combine the two so me and another member of our telegram chat group
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:05.840]   That I believe the German chat group, you know, that individual and I our submissions became the sleep and rest
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:12.880]   frequency that's going to be available on the website in the near future and in my submission I took
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.560]   You know, when I when I did the I did the post-mortem on the pain management contest
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.520]   And I will do a post-mortem on the sleep and rest contest
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:28.000]   But I took a tip from the person who won that contest and she added a stone to her list of frequencies
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.880]   For the contest is and I thought well, you know what if that worked for her
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.480]   I'm gonna give it a try and I did it as well
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:41.240]   And so in my frequency submission among the list of substances that I used I used Celeste height
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:48.360]   Which is a of which is a crystal that has the energy of rest and calm
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.720]   And I added that and hey, I tied for first need a little bit of bragging rights here
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.180]   But you know, it's just one of many substances obviously, but you know putting these
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:04.560]   vibrations of natural stones and natural crystals is a very powerful thing
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.920]   Realizing now that hey, you know, we had two contests with you know dozens
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:15.120]   I mean dozens like 70 80 different people trying to submit their ideas for what would be a good frequency set
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:23.240]   to you know how to deliver these types of results and for both of the first places in both contests to contain a
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:30.840]   Crystal or stone as part of the frequencies is pretty tell it's a big tell in terms of like how
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:36.560]   important and how critical and critically helpful that these could be so
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.320]   Definitely want to recommend using stones. So oh by the way, I'm sorry
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:47.000]   I skipped this page one of the things I want to tell you about the mandalas if you just go on healing mandalas on Google and
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.400]   Click images you get a whole bunch. So you don't really need to get a book or anything
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.340]   Here's all the different mandalas you can find on Google just clicking on images. Okay, sorry about that
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.520]   Okay, now back to crystals and stones
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.200]   So if you just Google list of stones and crystals and their frequency
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:09.320]   you can basically find you know it basically Google give you a huge list and it pulls from all these different resources, right?
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.840]   And so one of the things right here just to kind of give you an idea on the different crystals
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.280]   You could use for different things for different manifestations just as an example
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:24.580]   There's high frequency mid and low frequency crystals, but just you know clear quartz considered a master healer with a high
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.640]   Balancing frequency right citrine
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:34.720]   enhances creativity abundance and optimism a smoky quartz is a grounding stabilizing energy
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.760]   Etc, so you can see where all of these
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:45.880]   Types of materials. He's these natural mother earth stones and crystals. They all have their own character
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:54.360]   And it's just part of our natural world and the identification of these characters is has been developed over time
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:59.400]   like the ancients till now thousands of years of healers, you know
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.720]   Kind of figuring out what works best for what and it's this ancient knowledge
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:10.000]   That's been passed down to us in terms of how to use crystals and stones for healing and for manifesting
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.320]   And so this is a really great idea
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.040]   Highly recommend that this be one of the things on your list of things
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.840]   You want to give it a try if you're planning to tinker with your block
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.280]   And you kind of you know want to do don't want you know you want to do more with your block
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.680]   You know just beyond just you know charging food and water again, too
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.440]   You know you can go right here and click on any one of these charts, and you can get a book on it
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.120]   You can get a chart that tells you what all the different
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:40.040]   You know different various stones and crystals will do so you know which ones to use and then of course
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.780]   I've got a book and so in the crystals for energy healing book
[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.000]   You know, it's basically a source
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.840]   It's a source book of a hundred crystals and this book
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.360]   I'm recommending because not only does it list all the crystals and again
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.920]   You don't need to buy a book to get the list
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.120]   You know as I just showed you
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.760]   But what's kind of cool about this is that the author really gets into crystal grids
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.000]   And you know and this my past life was really into this kind of stuff
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.360]   And so I used to create crystal grids and seal them and organize and use them for charging plates and all sorts of stuff
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:16.960]   But the idea here is that I was thinking was beyond you know just going beyond right
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.960]   Just placing these crystals and stones and
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:25.560]   Manifesting their vibration throughout your field or entangling it with someone
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:32.200]   But also using the idea for crystals for energy healing because in that world crystal healers
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.760]   And this is all like ancient stuff that actually is working and lots of healers are doing this
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:46.040]   But they basically in this book it shows you how to set up your crystal grid what types of crystals to use for different types of
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.160]   You know so here's one right here for
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.880]   Basically balancing your chakras right so let me kind of blow this up a little because you can kind of see it
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.040]   So you know and basically it says hey, here's all the different crystals you would want to use
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.440]   And so then it would basically tell you how to place them
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:05.560]   And so my thought here for a really cool tinker, and I haven't tried this yet
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:11.440]   I was just kind of reading this book for the video, but I was just thinking you know this it would be so cool to combine
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:19.640]   crystal healing right and placing the crystals on specific points of the body and this is just one example and then
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:26.040]   Doing that while you're inside your block. Wow, you know talk about you know like basically up your game
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:32.920]   So not only doing crystal grid energy healing, but also basically placing the crystals wherever they need to be placed
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.240]   Which is what this book teaches you but also doing it while you're inside your block
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:42.840]   I thought was a really cool tinker so I kind of wanted to share that with you there. So that's it for part three
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.200]   I hope you found this interesting I continue to always you know be looking for
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:53.720]   Information that will I can share with you guys to kind of get you excited and and give you ideas on ways
[00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:58.320]   You could leverage your block. So here, you know by all means, you know try some mantras
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:05.640]   Manifest your intentions using those symbols energy and Reiki symbols mandalas and of course stones and crystals
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.120]   You know to help improve your life and improve the lives of of your loved ones. So there you go
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:18.000]   That's part three of tinkering with quantum blocks. Thank you very much for listening and watching my video
