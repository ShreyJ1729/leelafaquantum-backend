[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tingers Academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and this video
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:13.200]   Merry Christmas! It's Christmas 2024 and here are some quantum gift-giving ideas for those of you
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.360]   who would like to spread positive vibrations and good frequencies to all of your loved ones this
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:26.320]   coming holiday season. Yes I know it's early but some of my ideas have a long lead time so I wanted
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.880]   to get this out early get you guys thinking get you excited about what you can do with your blocks
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.480]   as well as how you can share the gift of quantum energy. So here let's just jump right in so first
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.760]   thing I want to just mention you know there's there's just this set of no brainers it's a no-brainer
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.880]   that if you wanted to gift someone the gift of positive energy clearly you know there's gift cards
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:58.160]   available on the Layla Q site for products and gift cards available on quantum upgrade for quantum
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.200]   upgrade services so if you go to the quantum upgrade website you click on shop right here you
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.480]   click on gift cards then just going to give you various options on all the different gift cards
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.960]   that are available for you know you can you know go ahead and just give this to somebody and then
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.600]   they get subscribed or you know if you want to be super generous you could always add them to your
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.880]   subscription and then use the sharing feature so they can control their own settings and then the
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.400]   billing would just go to you now if you go over to the the Layla quantum tech site if you go right
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.760]   into the shop section the you know the shop area you just click on gift cards then the gift cards
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.760]   are available right there and you can just set the amount you want to gift and then they can use
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.480]   these gift cards on the site you know so that's kind of a no-brainer you know just for them now you
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.400]   could also then of course you know buy products for them and there are some great products and
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.120]   I have bought numerous different products so clearly you know some of the great gifts you could give
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.440]   people that would just you know really kind of just share that positive vibration on that positive
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.800]   energy with your loved ones you know the capsules are awesome the water bottles are great there's
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.600]   going to be there's a jacket right now that that they've been selling for a couple years but there's
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.240]   going to be a new jacket that's going to have a lot more features and phillips really excited about
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.320]   it that's phillip right there the owner operator and so we were just talking about it there's
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.720]   going to be a new jacket coming out in a few weeks so you know just in time for you know
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.400]   the holiday shopping season so I bought my daughter one of the original jackets she loves it I'm
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.280]   probably going to be buying her a new one for Christmas and don't tell her and then of course
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.880]   you know there's t-shirts and hats and then for people with pets you know the quantum charts
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.120]   callers these are some of the great ideas it's all a no-brainer you know just sharing
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.600]   Leila quantum tech with people who otherwise you know just don't have those kinds of things
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.080]   or you know I just haven't thought about getting some for themselves so that's kind of just the
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.080]   easy ones right and that's just I just wanted to put that out there that they're great ideas
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.800]   definitely something to consider but then the other thing too that I want to kind of share with
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:06.720]   you for you block owners only and this is one of the incredible perks and benefits of actually
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.160]   having a block as opposed to a subscription which you know they're both incredibly wonderful
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.680]   but having a block you can really start doing stuff because you've got control of what you want
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.600]   to create using your block so one of the very first thing is you know it's custom capsules now
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.200]   I've done this numerous times and all sorts of different ways and and one of the first things I
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.440]   want to say about a custom capsule is you can make it any metal you want which is really cool so you
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.520]   can use brass you can use gold and silver so just to kind of give you some ideas on basically if you
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.480]   wanted to go and I'll be giving you guys links in the video description for all this stuff if you
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.200]   want to just take a look at it but if you just go on eBay you know there's just multiple different
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.320]   sites we'll sell these brass capsules now the thing is is they I think they ship from China so
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.480]   it does take a few weeks to get them so you want to order them early but the idea though is you could
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.040]   order your own blank brass capsules you can go on Etsy and order the titanium spheres and you could
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.120]   make your own Leila capsules and then share those with your friends and loved ones as a great gift
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.680]   you know and then you can also create silver you can you know the idea here is any metal will work
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.880]   and so now I've actually made silver capsules you know for my daughter and she wasn't so thrilled of
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.880]   the brass one you know she's a girl girly girl I didn't think that was beautiful enough
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.760]   so I got her one of these and just it's just one little example of what a sterling silver
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.600]   capsule is looks like you know and you just basically go on eBay and and you I'm not sure if
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   Amazon sells them but I know eBay does because that's where I've got the old one the one I got for her
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.560]   and I made her a silver one because she just wasn't thrilled with the brass one now also too you know
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.520]   they also make gold ones and they get kind of pricey you can kind of see like right here
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.920]   you know a 10 karat gold capsule you know they call them they either call them a capsule pendant
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.600]   or they call them urn pendants for people that you know want to have you know carry the ashes of a
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.040]   loved one in a pendant so but you know they're empty so you can put your you know titanium spheres in
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.800]   there you could put whatever you want in there as long as it's metal because you want it to hold
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.680]   the charge and hold whatever frequency you're using but you know you can definitely here's a 10 karat
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.440]   gold you know capsule pendant urn pendant you know it's pricey it's made out of gold but you know
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.760]   you could really get fancy with this and of course there's different shapes you know there's hard
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.880]   shapes and you name it okay so that's my point is that there's a lot of different options where you
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.720]   can just create capsules for people and you're not just restricted to creating just a layla brass
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.960]   capsule now the other thing I do want to mention too that when you do create your capsules
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.160]   I made a tutorial called how to use your super capsule and in that tutorial I showed people how
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.760]   to make custom frequencies with spheres or you know if you have a block make custom frequency
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.240]   put them on foils so if you let's say you have you know like you have a bunch of the layla frequencies
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.560]   or you could you want to make your own frequencies but one of the things that I have done
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:21.280]   is I've made like a basically a blank brass capsule for people it's you know and it's a
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.080]   super capsule like an olympic capsule right that's on the website so it's just blank meaning it's
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.880]   all pure quantum energy I use my infinity blocks my you know the strongest one so I make a strong
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.160]   super capsule right or olympic capsule so it's just quantum energy and then what I do is I make
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.840]   five separate foils so I make one of like the happiness frequency I make one usually like it's
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.000]   the woman's booster or the men's booster depending on who I'm gifting it to abundance prosperity you
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.040]   know all these positive you know positive kind of frequencies and I put them in little envelopes
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.040]   and I put little labels on them so then and then I put the you know I put them in that little purple
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.480]   bag that layla sells and so for a nice presentation but it's kind of cool where you can give someone
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.520]   a neutral capsule with five different foils and they can interchange what frequency they want to
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.320]   use it with you know you just show I show you in the tutorial how to do that and it's kind of a
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.040]   cool thing you know it's like you know just you can just you can make that capsule whatever they
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.840]   want and give them that flexibility and give them multiple frequencies to use with it and it's
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.160]   pretty cool and everyone has loved those when I when I've gifted those things and then I did
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.400]   mention the custom frequencies so you know you're never if you have a block you're never just you
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.400]   know just stuck with just whatever layla sells there's tons of frequencies all over the place
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.920]   and so whatever you know would help that person you know whatever if they have a condition
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.080]   you can create a special frequency foil for them and put that foil in there so they can use that
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.760]   with their capsule or make them a card you know whatever but the idea though is you can customize
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:59.680]   capsules you can customize frequencies and those are some great gifts and everyone I've ever gifted
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.440]   those two have absolutely loved them now the other thing obviously you have a block so you can charge
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:12.320]   stuff and charging stuff is really just like the sky's the limit and so here are some ideas for
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.840]   quantum gifts in which you know you can just like if you're buying someone jewelry charge it I just
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:25.040]   recently gave my daughter a nice silver sterling silver bracelet that I got off of ebay and then I
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.160]   charged it with vitamins and mineral frequencies and then I just gifted it to her just to say you
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:36.000]   know they just carry that frequency around with you she loved it got her a sterling silver ring
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.320]   to match you know and I charged that with something and so and she's just wearing them and she loves
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.520]   that that jewelry and it's not just you know it's not just nice silver jewelry or gold you know
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.160]   but it's charged with you know positive energy positive frequencies of course the water bottles
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.440]   water bottles are great if you got a bunch of nibblings you know like you know like nephews
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.240]   and nieces and whatever just getting them all a nice charged water everybody uses a water bottle
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.640]   why not get a nice metal one and go ahead and charge that and you can put frequencies in it too
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:10.400]   now infosuticles is another thing and if you're not familiar with that the idea behind infosuticles
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.840]   is basically and it's just here's just one example of it a company that sells it but what they do is
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:22.080]   they sell little bottles of water that have been imprinted or has a frequency copied onto them
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.920]   you know it's just kind of a little silly thing but you know it's kind of a cool little gift
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.480]   and so if somebody wants to let's say you know whatever you want to gift them you can give them
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:36.000]   like you can make infosuticles for them you can make them infosuticles of their vitamins you can
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   make infosuticles of whatever you know like whatever they're into you know and you can just make
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.720]   these little bottles of infosuticles and you can give them and give them like a nice little set
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.560]   and you know it's kind of a cool thing but you know it exists it's out there in the world people
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.160]   are actually making and selling them and so you could easily make them and gift them yourself
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.880]   now another idea too about people you know we're all carrying a cell phone and no I don't know if
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:06.480]   most of you guys may or may not know this but there's actually a frequency called the emf harmonization
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.600]   and protection frequency and it comes on a card on the Leleque site and you know this is a great
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.280]   you know like people that are kind of concerned about emf and you know there's all these different
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:20.000]   places selling emf stickers which the majority don't work you know from all the different studies on
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.320]   those things but this works this has got science behind it so why not get them the emf card or
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.280]   make your own which is where I'm going you know charge your own you could make your own emf
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.840]   card that they could just slide in behind their phone you know inside their phone case right just
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:43.360]   like a really cool kind of emf thing for their phone now there's also emf clothing now as I mentioned
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:50.320]   you know the Leleque quantum tech themselves they sell the emf clothing as in the form of t-shirts
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:57.680]   beanies baseball hats and also jackets okay but however you like but but you know right now they
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.120]   don't have a woman's underwear product they don't have pet products and so one of the things that I
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.840]   you know I think that would be a great gift idea is to just you know go on amazon and by you know
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:14.080]   links again all in the description but going on amazon and finding other kinds of emf clothing
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.720]   items that you can't get from Lele and then go ahead and charging them so you can get anything
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:25.440]   from hoodies to shawls to scarves I mean there's so many things little throws but they're all emf
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:31.600]   type of materials I've got the metal right metal threads woven into the material and so you can
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:37.200]   get all of these different kinds of emf clothing and then what charge it yourself and so if you
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.400]   charge it which is that quantum energy then you give that that clothing not only a shielding
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.600]   you know a shielding capability but also it's going to be doing something on their biology
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:54.000]   and mitigating the effect of emf internally as well so giving the gift of hey you know of emf
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.320]   protection to the people you love couldn't be a better gift if you know I mean honestly it's a
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.560]   great gift so if you can't find the type of clothing that you'd like to gift like I just
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:08.240]   showed you then go and buy it and charge it with your block okay so that's another really
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:14.160]   good idea that I have done as well now there's more so and there's more so one of the things
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:20.320]   that I kind of want to share with you the concept of of you know for a car and home and also for pets
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.440]   now what are the different you know the different gift ideas that I got for for you on this one
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.400]   so now here's the thought that I this is my thinking you know my logic that I want to share
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:37.680]   with you and that is you know using metal cubes or metal plates and you could use them for different
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:44.160]   things and let me explain my logic now I've also I've actually done this and so if you so this is
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:51.280]   my logic on it right now if you take one of those Leila capsules it weighs 1.2 ounces and it has a
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:59.440]   12 foot diameter energy field meaning that you take 1.2 ounces of metal charge it right and you know
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:05.120]   and they use at Leila they use a 2,200 infinity block or I don't know if it's an infinity block
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:11.440]   but the block that they use to create their products is a 2,200 block okay so if you have a
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:18.080]   boosted IB infinity block it's 2,700 if you've got a new infinity block you bought this year
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:25.840]   it's 3,800 if you've got a grand block that puppies 1,800 if you've got a travel block that's 1,133
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.640]   you know so there's there's different varying strengths but the idea though is that if you've got
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:37.200]   one of these stronger blocks then this is the logic okay so if a 1.2 ounces of metal will generate
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:44.320]   a 12 foot diameter field then what would happen right if you've got more metal more metal bigger
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:50.640]   field now there's no linear math on this nobody knows Philip hasn't tested it it's just to me
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:56.800]   kind of like quantum common sense so here's some ideas on what you could do which is giving
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:04.240]   somebody a charged chunk of metal okay now here's the idea now you could get a cube and you can get
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.360]   any metal you want but I just I'm just defaulting on titanium right now because that's kind of the
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.320]   apples to apples comparison to the to the to the capsule right because the majority of the capsule
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.120]   weights the five spheres plus the brass but you know mostly you know the titanium is what holds the
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:26.240]   energy so I'm just thinking that hey if you got like a titanium cube and so here's here's the idea
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:33.040]   you go on to Amazon and you buy a titanium sphere and the one that I found was like 1.5 inches right
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:39.520]   so 1.5 inch titanium cube a little cube of metal and this is you know what it looks like right
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:45.360]   and you get one of those and it's going to weigh 8.8 ounces and that's basically you know it that's
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:51.120]   like having seven capsules up or one big capsule that's the size of seven either way right but it's
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:57.360]   this it's the it's the equivalent weight of seven capsules so obviously the field would be way
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:03.840]   bigger than 12 feet and you know what it would be big enough for a little 1.5 inch titanium cube
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.760]   which is kind of cool looking it's kind of like a little keepsake dust collecting
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.440]   desktop thing right I mean it's cool and I'm nerd okay so I think it's cool okay but if
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.960]   you know it's a weight of seven capsules so it's perfect you know for putting in your car
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:25.280]   right because like the the the recommendation on cars not electronic vehicles right those are
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:31.280]   way different from an EMF standpoint but just regular cars are have you know they still have
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.800]   a high level of EMF because you're inside a metal box a lot of wiring and so and there's electricity
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:42.480]   going through the car right so the recommendations always been you know where one capsule for yourself
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.800]   but if you want to do the whole car is you know the recommendation was have four capsules in there
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.880]   that was what has been the recommendation if you wanted to if you know if you didn't have a travel
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.600]   block in fact this was way before travel blocks were even available so you know it's like hey you
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.280]   should have four for a car and then that would do it right well if you had a 1.5 inch little titanium
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:06.960]   cube that was charged in a block you know it's and it's the equivalent weight of seven capsules
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:12.240]   boom you're good you're you've got enough energy that's surround the car and give you that quantum
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:18.080]   energy EMF mitigation protection that you know we're all after right and so just these little tiny
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.320]   cubes you could put them in your car you could use them in your home you could put anyone these
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.720]   little cubes that you charge you could put it in a room and that room would then be you know would
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.440]   be you know serana with quantum energy coming emanating from this little cube like like a capsule
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.920]   would or in the barn or in the office you know there's all these different places you could put
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.440]   these cubes or you know where they would basically emanate quantum energy and everything would be
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.360]   in that field and you'd have all the benefits of that you that you read about and hear about in
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.240]   terms of the studies now the other thing too that's really cool is that you can get a bigger cube
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:57.120]   and so like the absolute nerd in me went looking for one and so there's a one kilogram cube
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:04.720]   happens to be on sale right now it's like this one's on sale for like 279 it's like 47 percent
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.920]   I'm not affiliated with any of this and then so it's so cool I mean it comes on its own little
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:17.600]   stand right and it's like it's basically a thousand gram one you know a thousand gram one kilogram
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:23.840]   cube of titanium totally cool if you have a nerdy in your life this is cool so it's a big square
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:34.000]   of titanium now that 1000 milligrams or it's one kilogram of of titanium is equal to 35.3 ounces
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.880]   which is like 29 capsules so if you just had that if you wanted to say like you know and you know
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:47.600]   and let's here is here's my point you can buy this thing for 279 and so if you don't have enough
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.000]   money to give somebody a block and but you know you still want to give them the you know the
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.280]   benefit of quantum energy and you want to have it for their their whole house or their whole barn
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:03.520]   right then this is a great idea you could just charge this titanium cube and then just say hey
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:08.800]   here's a you know here's a positive energy titanium cube just put this in your house
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.440]   and this thing is going to be putting out quantum energy and it's going to basically you know
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.760]   create a little energy field around your home because it's going to have that much energy it's
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.960]   like 29 capsules right and that's the that's my logic okay and that's kind of how I was thinking
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:28.000]   about this but I thought it was a really cool idea to be gifting somebody one of these cubes that
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.080]   you create just because it's cool and it's positive quantum energy now the same can be done for
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:40.000]   metal plates and so if you go on Amazon there's this one site sorry one store and you know there's
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.080]   multiple different stores here's just an example but this one here they basically sell metal plates
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.880]   and they sell aluminum plates okay now I haven't looked for titanium plates but I'm just going
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.560]   off of aluminum plates because you know that's what the blocks are made out of our aluminum plates
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.960]   and so they can make these plates they come in different sizes here's the one that's six inches
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:08.240]   by six inches by one inch thick you know 27 27 bucks 15% coupon and then so basically it's an
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.200]   aluminum plate and so what they do with what you would do with this plate is you would charge the
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:19.680]   plate so buying a metal plate aluminum plate or you know titanium if you could find it and then
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.320]   what you would do is you would charge it and what would you do with the charged you know aluminum
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:30.720]   plate well guess what it works perfectly as a charged item for putting under a computer
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.440]   putting it under your router if you got a smart meter put it over put it you know
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.800]   over that if you got it in the kitchen you could put it under your bowl that you keep your fruit
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:45.520]   in right you could just in other words you could target little tiny areas of your house
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.760]   which is a really strong level of quantum energy because it's sitting on a charged
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:56.080]   tile or you know plate of aluminum and then you can just really kind of concentrate that that
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.720]   energy right there so you could be in your kitchen you could put it in your refrigerator
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.760]   right like putting it on the bottom of every shelf of your refrigerator so that it's constantly
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.840]   you know putting out that energy you know into the food your water and so forth and so that's kind
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:18.480]   of one of the ideas of of being able to gift somebody quantum energy where you know you may not be
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:25.120]   able to afford right giving them a cube a lot of us can't these aren't you know i mean not cube but
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.480]   block you know so if you can't afford a block and you can't gift a block well you can afford maybe
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:35.600]   you know it's up to you but you can afford charging a little cube of metal or a plate of metal and
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.920]   giving that to them and then just telling them hey this is what you would use it for put it under
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.880]   your Wi-Fi router you know mitigate the emf coming out of that put the plate in your refrigerator
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.600]   right put your cheese on top of it right keep your cheese quantum charge and and all the benefits
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.000]   that you would get from having that quantum energy inside your refrigerator or on your countertop
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.280]   so those are some ideas that i thought you might be interested in okay now the other ideas here for
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.720]   for pets and we all have pets and we love them so much our moms have pets our dads have pets our
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:10.160]   friends have pets so what a great Christmas gift and to give somebody something for their animal so
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.240]   obviously you know like just like Layla does if you don't like the type of collar that Layla
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:19.680]   sells no problem go buy another collar just make sure it's got some metal on it you know it all
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:24.000]   has to have metal right that's going to hold the energy so definitely getting them collars getting
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.720]   them tags and one of the things that's kind of cool about dog tags is i found a site that sells
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:34.080]   titanium dog tags and by the way i'm always going to default to titanium because that's like the go
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:39.120]   to we know works because that's what Layla uses for their spheres right so that's why i'm defaulting
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:45.600]   to titanium but get them a titanium dog tag to put on you know to put on their pet
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.400]   they come in all different shapes and sizes and also too you know if there's dog tags that come in
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:56.480]   sterling silver and so i found this site i think it's yeah this i found this one guy who sells custom
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:03.600]   made sterling silver dog tags dog pendants and the cool thing about this guy is that somewhere on his
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.320]   website or i think somewhere in here they'll customize you know like your your dog's paw print
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:12.160]   kind of thing so you can get all sorts of you know just go on Etsy there's thousands of people that
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:19.120]   do this but here's just an example of how you can get a really cool little thing for the animal or
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.760]   that person really likes their dog you can get a misterling silver pendant you know like this one's
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:30.640]   really cute 56 bucks charge it give it to them wonderful christmas gift you know for either tags
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:36.080]   for the people that own the dogs or the dog itself you know really cool stuff obviously and this is
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:41.600]   what i this is what i have going on in my house uh right now is i have metal dog bowls
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:47.280]   and i've charged all of my metal dog bowls so that when the water sitting and they're just like a
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:54.640]   ladle of water bottle well the the bowl is stainless steel it's charged and the water in the bowl is
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:00.160]   going to pick up the charge and the frequency the frequency i use for my dog's bowl is just dog
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:05.440]   vitamins you know you buy the little dropper bottles of dog vitamins and i just you know i charge
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:10.880]   that frequency into the bowl itself and then the water is picking up that frequency so they're
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.280]   always getting their the frequency of their vitamins and minerals when they drink their water
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:20.640]   so you know it's a it's a no-brainer right just a metal dog bowl obviously using the metal plates
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.440]   works great with pets you know if you want to basically kind of you know emf protect your pet
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.160]   there's a couple of ways you could take one of those metal plates and put it under their dog bed
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.480]   right so that when they're sleeping there they're in that little quantum field or what's even better
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:40.800]   is emf clothing right because they make emf clothing for dogs so you know and i don't know if
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.840]   they make it for cats but they you know i found one that uh is emf radiation protection pet jacket
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:51.760]   vest it's got that metal you know threads um embedded into the material so you can get your
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:58.640]   your dog a emf vest charge it right put that quantum energy in there to help the dog not only
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.840]   shield from physical radiation but also mitigated from a biological standpoint so you know it's like
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:09.600]   sixty bucks for a dog vest uh and it's emf and you know honestly if if you somebody gave me this
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:15.920]   hint hint hint i would totally love it uh for my dogs you know because i haven't gotten this yet
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.880]   i'll probably buy it for myself in their mind uh but you know i totally cool right so that's the idea
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:27.840]   here is that you know if you have a block you it is unlimited what you could charge and come up with
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:34.080]   when you think about a person and gifting them the the gift of positive energy i mean what could be
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:41.040]   a better gift than giving someone positive energy that not only is helpful it's like life force
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:46.240]   energy for themselves but it also helps with that emf and all that other wonderful stuff that you
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:53.440]   know you hear about from the studies so there you go that's my 2024 quantum gift ideas i wanted
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:58.240]   to share it with you it is a little early again but you know what you've got if you're going to do
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:03.920]   some of these little um tinks i'm a i'm a tinker these are tinks if you're going to create some of
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.600]   these wonderful little positive energy devices and and things to gift to people uh you're going to
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.800]   need some lead time so i wanted to get this video out early so you can go ahead and get creative and
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.960]   come up with what you want and honestly if you do some of this stuff please post it in the telegram
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:23.840]   chat group let us know what you came up with all ideas are awesome and it's great to be sharing it
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:29.280]   okay so there you go so thanks for watching the video mary christmas everybody yeah i know it's not
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:34.960]   halloween yet and i just want to say mary christmas anyway because it's coming up i mean today is like
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:42.800]   um october something it's october 16 which you know what october 16 means to everybody that there's
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:50.640]   only four paychecks till christmas so hey you know chop chop everybody get get going
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:55.600]   you've only got four paychecks till christmas and here are some great ideas on how you could
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:01.760]   spread positive quantum energy to all the people and pets that you love and so mary christmas everybody
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:11.440]   hope you enjoyed the video and have a great day aloha
