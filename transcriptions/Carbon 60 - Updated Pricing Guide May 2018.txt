[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   Hello everyone this is Kay Elmer and this is another carbon 60 video. This
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.320]   video is to cover the updated pricing guide that I did as of May 1st. The old one
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.760]   was February 22nd so it's been quite a few weeks and let's jump right in. I
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.120]   wanted to just share with you that there's a lot more commercial vendors out
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.360]   there that I've found. So the original one that I was done that I did back in
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.320]   November last year there was only about nine that you could find Googling and Duck
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.720]   Duck Go and now we've got well over there's over actually over 14 there's a
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.200]   couple I just didn't see and then I was done already so I'll add those to the
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.640]   next one and that's the 14 doing olive oil and then I've had to break out the
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.040]   other oils because there's just so many you know I just just try to get it fit
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.600]   on one page and so I've got coconut oil and avocado oil and in this new update
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.000]   I've actually got some specialty C60 products I want to cover with you but
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.200]   before I jump into that I wanted to just kind of talk about one thing that I
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.040]   just recently discovered that I hadn't noticed before and that was the
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.240]   definition of purity but for any way let me back up a sec. For those of you who
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.160]   have never seen this before I've been doing this pricing guide just to help
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.800]   people it's it's what I do I just wanted to share what I do when I'm looking
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.120]   around and I've been trying different products and so I keep track of what they
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.640]   cost and and it's real easy for me to kind of you know for me to figure out
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.720]   you know what's what's like all the different people that sell it and their
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.400]   purity levels of the C60 and you know whether or not how much C60 is in the
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.920]   bottle and then I right here is the column that is the one that it compares
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.240]   apples to apples I take all the information and people sell it in
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.200]   different sized bottles and and so but it all boils down mathematically to
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.040]   what's what does it cost per ounce so that you can compare apples to apples
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.440]   so here's a list of all the merchants that I found that are selling a product
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:02.400]   that's C60 product it is sorted in the cheapest price per ounce on top and the
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.280]   highest on the bottom this column here is the purity level and this is what I
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.360]   wanted to share I didn't notice this before but you know the most most of the
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.120]   folks that I believe are making the product are usually sourcing them
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.640]   sourcing the C60 from various manufacturers and primarily a company
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.280]   called SES there's one in Canada called Solaris and there's others but this SES
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.960]   seems to be the main one because this is actually the company that in the rat
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.520]   study the scientists bought their you know C60 from so a lot of folks buy it
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.280]   from here but I had not noticed this before so I wanted to point out as it
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.280]   relates to the percentage of purity what is what is what is now coming across
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.880]   and there's been some notes added on SES's website is they've actually when it
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.220]   says C60 99.95 there's two things right first of all they're actually starting
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.920]   to notate which ones of their purity levels are solvent free and obviously
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:08.520]   this one's not so if you see a you know a product that's 99.90 and if you look
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.480]   at SES you know they're 99.90 doesn't have this don't you know this notation
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.000]   solvent free you know it's just something you I mean they're all nothing's bad
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.520]   any at all but I just want to point that out that it's something you may want to
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.400]   ask them about but SES definitely is now stating that 99.95 C60 and 99.99 on
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.960]   their website they're actually saying the words they're solvent free and then
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.360]   there's this little asterisk so keep that in mind you know whether it has
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.040]   solvents in it or whether it's solvent free which you know obviously we all
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.080]   want to get to that point and put that little asterisk if you go to the bottom
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.240]   of the website what it says basically is that the purity is expressed in
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.840]   fullerene content compared to other carbon fullerene's content so that was
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.160]   one of the original things that I wasn't really clear about back in one of my
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.600]   first videos was okay what does that purity mean and I assume that the the
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.000]   extra was it was how much solvent was in it and that was how the percentage was
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.760]   expressed but here's an example you know there's this example carbon 70 if it
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:16.480]   says 98 percent that means that 98 percent of the carbon is pure C 70 in this
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.800]   in this example and the other 2 percent is other carbon so the other is not
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.240]   solvent the other is other carbon so in the example right here if you were to
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.120]   just say this like seems to be the favorite one everybody chooses most
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:37.960]   most everybody carbon 60 99.95 solvent free right and that other 0.05 that's
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.520]   not solvent so obviously so it says it's free it's actually other molecules of
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.120]   carbon C 70 C 71 C 74 etc etc there's just other little bits of carbon in
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.760]   there and if you do some research on that I actually did take a look at it
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.080]   there's full of reams right which is what this stuff is and there's something
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.220]   called fuller for our noise and you know it goes on and full full of
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.320]   full of knolls or something like that and there's just all these different you
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.920]   know molecules of carbon and that's what's going to be in that extra little 0.05
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.440]   percent and then right here that 0.01 percent is going to be just other carbon
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.040]   in there but what you're buying is solvent free so something new to me I
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.680]   never saw this before when I'd done my other scans so I definitely wanted to
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.200]   share with you so when you look at this purity level now it's the purity of
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.680]   the carbon and that's really kind of an important thing most everybody as you
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.760]   can see kind of stays around the 99.95 purity and then there's a few out there
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.200]   that are 99.99 which is pretty much the highest they can get I mean they really
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.000]   you know it they can't get perfect and 99.99 is pretty high so you know you're
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.520]   like red lion and ametris C 60 so those are that's the difference now of what
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.240]   purity means and the mmg which is milligrams per milliliter if you all
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:58.440]   remember from the rat study the rat study their amount of C 60 in the oil the
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:05.360]   maximum solubility that they were able to to get was 0.8 milligrams per milliliter
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.920]   and that has become sort of the benchmark and so the majority of products
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.600]   that are made are out there are 0.8 milligrams per milliliter which is how
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.520]   much C 60 is in the oil now you've got a couple of really unique products out
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.120]   there that are able to get a little above that and so carbon 60 plus you
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.640]   know they advertise that they have a full 1.0 milligram per milliliter of C
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.920]   60 in the oil okay so that's that's what this column means and then the rest of
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.440]   it is just the size of the bottle and the dollar amount that the is advertised on
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.920]   the website as of May 1 so that's how you read this chart the one thing I do
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.960]   want to point out is I've been keeping track of what the average cost is per
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.200]   ounce so way back in November and this is what's really great is a more you
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.720]   know obviously demand and supply and the more demand the you know the supply and
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.920]   the price goes down if there's enough supply so now there's there's very few
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.120]   folks that are actually running out there I mean there are a few people that
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.880]   are back ordered but the majority of these guys when I went to their sites
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.160]   they're no longer back ordered so you've got a much bigger supply I think the
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.840]   demand is slowly growing but now you've got supply outpacing demand so the
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.440]   prices are going down which is a big thumbs up for all of us that are buying
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.840]   it and I still you know even though I make a lot all the time I still buy
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.320]   because I like trying all the different the different brands and the different
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.120]   mixes because every one of these guys you know some of them are like steadfast
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.760]   you know following exactly what happened what the scientists did in the rat
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.680]   study with a few exceptions I mean there's nobody out here that's doing
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.800]   exactly what the scientists in the rat study did which would require them to
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.080]   buy kimlali olive oil from Tunisia and so forth but so but there are people out
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.720]   there that are spending a lot of time picking out the exact right perfect oil
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.720]   that they believe in olive oil brand olives that they believe is is the best
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.960]   you know combination with the C60 and and sourcing their oil is a big deal and
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.640]   and so it's really kind of cool you read all these sites and everyone's got their
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.600]   own little take on it and you know so far I've tried about four or five of
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.760]   these and you know they're all exceptional products from exceptional
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.440]   vendors but the good news is the average price if you just grab the top 10 and
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.880]   I'm doing the top 10 because there's only nine in the beginning so I'm trying to
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:21.440]   keep it consistent it's drowned the average is 10 15 and that's 8.9% decrease
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.240]   from the prior pricing guide so you know that's it's a good news for the
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.080]   market not great news for the manufacturers but you know hey for us
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.680]   consumers that's good and again I want to point out that up here on is the lowest
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:41.200]   to highest cost per ounce and it says low as 625 and if you remember from other
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.520]   videos you'll know that you know that's a great price but just keep in mind for
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.120]   74 bucks worth of equipment and about the same price you know a little
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.200]   actually more than that you have to go look at my numbers but you can make it
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.280]   at home you know and making it at home I'm averaging less than four dollars
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:04.320]   per ounce so even though you can buy it for six you still can save 30% if you
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.120]   you know if you make it yourself and you know I know everybody doesn't want to
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.160]   do that but I just wanted to point that out that you know you still can make it
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.400]   cheaper than anyone selling it so that's a that's a real important point so
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.760]   here's all the olive oil dealers or vendors merchants and then I've got the
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.240]   other oils and I broke that apart it used to be combined up here and these are
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.520]   the four that are offering in C60 in a different oil and so the first one this
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:34.700]   is a new merchant to the market and they're called C60 Labs and what's
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.120]   clinical is that they've actually added a new one that had that wasn't out there
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:44.760]   before and so now C60 Labs produces a C60 product in coconut avocado hemp seed
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.200]   and sunflower in addition to the olive oil for the same prices of the olive oil
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.560]   which is the dollar not mount here for the I think that's the one hundred and
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.040]   twenty millimeter bottle okay so that's kind of cool so there hasn't never been
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.080]   a hemp seed C60 product until now and the actual sunflower C60 product that
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.160]   they're selling is different than this the existing one so now there's two but
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.040]   they're actually quite different in how they're made but so we have a new vendor
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.160]   there Mitra also sells coconut and avocado and then you've got the purple
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.760]   power which is the coconut and live longer labs out here and they're selling
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.440]   coconut avocado as well now one of the other things too if you guys are into
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.320]   this there's a thing called MCT oil and for those of you who know what that is
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:30.000]   it's kind of like this real special kind of I think it's a special form of coconut
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.480]   oil and some of these vendors that are selling the coconut actually sell it in
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.280]   MCT so if you're looking for it just check out one of these four I don't I'm
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.600]   sorry I don't remember which one are there I think there's two of them they're
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.560]   doing MCT oil and so it's definitely something if that's your thing and you
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.040]   really want to try that out you know go check out these four guys now the only
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:56.440]   other little note I want to point out is purple power sells their biggest they
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.080]   actually have you know if you go to a proposed website the biggest one they
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.360]   show you is the 16 ounce bottle but they actually sell a 32 ounce bottle and
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.160]   they sell it through a reseller called vital vibe source so here's the link if
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.160]   you actually want to go buy this 32 ounce otherwise these other smaller sizes
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.000]   are what you're gonna find on that website all right so now new section I
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.840]   did do a little bit of moving around and so I want to point out that you know I
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:26.080]   kind of just sectioned off a group of oils that I'm calling specialty because
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.200]   they they're they're they're so out they're different than the other ones
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.440]   everything's kind of an apples to apples comparison in terms of how they're
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:37.840]   made except these five their their their advertised is very different than the
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.520]   other ones that are out there and I just want to point that out so I really
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.640]   couldn't compare them you know to each other so I just kind of wrote a
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.920]   description so I did move C - 60 down that's Bob Gressa's product it's not a
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.640]   if you read the website and you listen to the interviews where he's been
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:12:00.480]   interviewed the way it's described it is not liposomal you know what they
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.280]   call a lipo fluorine it that's not how he does it it is monomolecular like the
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.800]   like what red line advertises where they pulverize it down to a less than I
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:17.480]   think it's less than 300 nanometer cluster of C - 60 well according to Bob if
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:24.160]   you Bob Gressa if you listen to his interviews he's got it down to individual
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.080]   molecules and one molecule of C - 60 is one nanometer so really really really
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.720]   tiny tiny tiny clusters I'm sorry not even a cluster actually individual
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.760]   molecules and he puts that in the sunflower oil and does not and does not
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:44.280]   sonicated it's just mixed in there and so you're it's just a carrier for the C - 60
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:49.440]   so you're literally taking Rossy 60 in a carrier oil so very unique product I'm
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.200]   actually trying that one right now because I thought that was kind of real
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.480]   interesting so I've been on it for about a week so I'm trying it now me and the
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.880]   dog the champion 60 brand I brought that down from the other categories because
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.520]   it is very different it's it's actually four pets but not just the fact that is
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:10.280]   four pets but it's a proprietary blend of oils and they've actually included
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.040]   enzymes in the oil so it's not your none of the other ones in the in the above
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.600]   here all these other ones above you know if you go up here I mean this is just
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.840]   olive oil this is just coconut oil this is just avocado but you get down in here
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.160]   and and the champion 60 brand it's a mix of different oils and then they've
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.040]   included a couple other ingredients so very different and I put that into this
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.240]   specialty group because it just doesn't compare and then there's these three
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.400]   other ones I wanted to share with you that I that I discovered for C60 products
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:47.440]   there's canada carbon and canada carbon is that CBD oil the hemp oil that this
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.800]   CBD healthy component of the sativa plant the marijuana plant so there's
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:58.960]   CBD in the oil and it actually has carbon 60 in the oil so I actually got a
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.320]   hold of these guys and I asked you know what you know and so it's basically at
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:10.680]   they use a 99.90 C60 0.8 milligrams so it's it's fully saturated CBD oil but
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:16.400]   the but the amount of CBD in the oil in per bottle is only about 125 I think they
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.000]   said it was like 500 you know as they said it was 500 milligrams and four
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.960]   ounces so it comes out to 125 milligrams per ounce of CBD so if you buy CBD for
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.520]   you guys that buy it you know like the one I did in my one video was 1500
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.480]   milligrams I bought the strongest one you could buy I see now that some CBD
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.760]   resellers and not resellers but sellers are selling I think it goes up to
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:44.000]   2500 milligrams I mean that's a lot of CBD in one little bottle and so that's
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.480]   the high end and then the 125 would be the low end so it's it's not the most
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.800]   potent CBD oil but it's fully saturated with C60 so here you go the first real
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.680]   CBD C60 commercial product you know and I'm always I'm making it at home about
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.720]   once every two weeks I make my own version of this and mine's a lot
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.360]   stronger but this is it this is what's really cool there's a commercial product
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:12.840]   now for CBD C60 oil and then there's this other one called Wild Leaf Hemp and I
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.040]   caught I found this guy because he did a video there's a video interview of him
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.920]   and and so I got a hold of him and it was asking okay well how much is in the
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.200]   oil because if you read the website it's kind of hard to find and he said that
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:31.120]   that they have a thousand milligrams of CBD oil okay so it's a real potent CBD
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:37.320]   oil and then how it was described to me in the email was it's infused with C60
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:44.920]   and turmeric through some cell signaling plasma technology that he
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:49.360]   described to me and then I said well how much exactly is in the bottle and he
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.800]   said well it's such a new technology that you know there's no way to measure it
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.400]   yet so the notation here that it's unmeasurable is is directly from a
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:02.480]   quote that he gave me when I asked him how much C60 is in there so I so like
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:05.120]   that's it I mean I don't know how much C60 is in there I want to share that so
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.640]   then there's these yes lab product brand new product that just came out since
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:14.000]   the last pricing guide and so they've got a C60 in oil product and they
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.120]   advertise it at 99.99 which is you know the highest purity of C60 and they're
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.880]   advertising that they're able to accomplish 1.0 milligram per milliliter
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:29.440]   in C60 and then they've got this other aspect to the oil which is there they
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.800]   are saying that it's bonded with hydrogen and it's bioactivated with quote life
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:40.200]   energy and they've got enzymes in there so it's really out there very different
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.000]   very specialty but you know of course if you want to check out any of these
