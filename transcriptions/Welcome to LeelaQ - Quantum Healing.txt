[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and this
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.640]   video is another installment in the series. Welcome to Layla Q, also known as Layla Quantum Tech,
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.120]   where I'm kind of going over all of the frequently asked questions that are popping up in the telegram
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.160]   chat group for new and existing customers so that you can kind of get a more lengthy
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.800]   explanation to some of the many questions that come up all the time. So today's video is about
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.760]   quantum healing. So you know that literally is one of the biggest questions if I were to say what
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.080]   are the top five? It is definitely one of the top five where people will come into the telegram
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.400]   chat group or even be attracted to you know the whole idea of Layla quantum tech or quantum upgrade
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.960]   because they have something that they want to heal you know whether it's an issue with themselves
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.400]   or it's an issue with their loved one but there seems to be a overriding you know that's the momentous
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.360]   right of why people come to Layla quantum tech and they're seeking out solutions. So here's the
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.760]   video on what you or what the you know what the recommendation is for me as it relates to using
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.120]   Layla quantum tech or quantum upgrade for healing. So before now this because this one is kind of
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.520]   touching on a sensitive subject there's definitely a disclaimer I want to make sure everyone's really
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.560]   clear that neither Layla quantum tech nor the Tinkers Academy recommend or endorse any specific
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.200]   tests, physicians, procedures, opinions or other information that made me mention this video.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.760]   Reliance on any information appearing and discuss in this video is solely at everyone's own risks
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.800]   statements made have not been evaluated by the EFSA or FDA or any governmental derivatives that
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.840]   are of Layla quantum tech products and products that layla quantum tech may represent or not
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.840]   intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. So the contents of this video is my opinion
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.960]   and it's also the experience of what other people have been reporting in our telegram check group
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.400]   for which I've been a moderator since the day it started. So first thing I want everyone to
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.960]   realize about the concept of quantum healing and as it relates to Layla quantum tech now you know
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.680]   because outside of that world it actually has a different definition but in quantum healing
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.000]   as it relates to Layla quantum tech it really kind of is something that is a you know it's it touches
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   on three of the four you know aspects of what I would consider whole body healing. So I really
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.720]   just want to point out that there is no silver bullet there's no one size fit all to anything
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.040]   having to do with our health and a healing because we all have a different starting point. Every
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.360]   single one of us has a different toxic load level different pathogen load level different chronic
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.520]   conditions they've been dealing with you know different genetics I mean we're so different
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.480]   than each other that there's no one size fit all there's no silver bullet and doing any of this
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.720]   stuff may or may not have the results you're seeking so just keep that in mind but the whole
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.320]   idea though there's really four components to whole body healing in general and there's the aspect of
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.680]   there's you have a biology I mean regardless of the fact that the most important aspect of your
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.160]   health is your consciousness because you know we all know that our thoughts can make us sick right
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.200]   well our thoughts can also make us well so you know our thoughts are the overriding you know just
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.360]   omnipresence of everything about our reality which includes our health and our and our and our you
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.640]   know our physical stamina but the concept though is that you know just because that you know it's
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.840]   really rare obviously for people who have that level of consciousness to control that so the most
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.680]   of us are you know stuck in our mere mortals stuck in the world of biology we have a meat sack and
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.080]   that meat sack requires a whole bunch of stuff in order to heal and stay healthy okay so there's
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.920]   that one aspect and that's where Layla just doesn't go but Layla can all but Layla does actually work
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.920]   on raising consciousness the blocks do and the quantum upgrade do it also obviously is an energy
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.320]   life force energy that you know perpetuates all of you know life right and so there's that quantum
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.440]   energy aspect so it brings that energy in and it amplifies the energy that you know that you have
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.480]   within your biology right and then there's the vibrational aspect you know what's also known as
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.720]   frequency medicine but you know it's like everything is frequency so Layla touches on vibration
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.480]   energy and consciousness so it's a really really nice complement to anyone's you know medicine
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.040]   cabinet at their house in terms of like hey you know when I have an issue that's regarding my health
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.520]   within myself or you know my loved ones include your pets right includes plants too that you know
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.920]   I can you know that you know how do you use Layla quantum tech for these purposes so let's jump
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.320]   right into that now the very first thing I want to make sure you're very aware of and this is the
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.360]   only caution about all of this stuff is that the on the left side of this page right here are the
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.640]   measured biological reactions from all of the various studies there's well over 60 third party
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.560]   independent you know placebo placebo controlled studies literally the you know the the gold standard
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.880]   for doing scientific studies hired by Layla so they've hired universities and clinics and and
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.360]   institutes to do all of these studies and this is the list of what happens and it's scientifically
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:23.920]   proven multiple studies that when you are exposed to quantum energy that this stuff is going to
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.480]   happen to your body you're probably not going to feel any of it right I mean how do you feel
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.960]   that you know your white blood cell cell count increasing but this is what's going to happen
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:41.280]   and because this actually has a real tangible measurable scientifically proven physical reaction
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:48.240]   in your body then there have been people and it's it's quite a few people have reported that they
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.760]   are having some kind of a detox reaction because when all of this in your body is being stimulated
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.800]   by the quantum energy depending again on your starting point you know if you've got a heavy
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.840]   toxic load you know you you're not somebody who detoxes constantly and that sort of thing but
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.680]   you know we all have a different reaction to different things and so some people
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.320]   will have what we call a detox reaction and that's why the recommendation you know Philip
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.720]   mentions this in all of his interviews drink lots of water you know keep keep start low build up
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.680]   and the whole idea behind the capsules right as there's five spheres the recommendation is start
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.040]   with one and then build up to the full five for full you know the full power and all of that kind
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.680]   of stuff so and same thing with quantum upgrade start low you can turn up the dial later but just
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.040]   get used to it if you're brand new to energy medicine you know take it slow it does don't jump into
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.560]   the deep end if you aren't sure you know how well you can swim all right so there are detox
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.120]   reactions and so just be very aware of that and then the recommendation is whether it's
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.920]   you're trying to do healing or just you know work on your health start slow start low you know and
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.560]   don't just jump into the deep end of the pool so be where there are detox reactions and those
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:07.440]   reactions can can all the way go up from just being really thirsty to fatigue affecting your sleep
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.400]   headaches i mean i've i've heard so many different variations of hey i just started doing this and
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.800]   i feel weird and you know and then and then recommendation immediately to them is turn the
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.040]   volume down you know take out the spheres right that sort of thing so that's the first caution the
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.200]   second caution here is if you have a chronic condition and this kind of happens a lot where
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.960]   people will come into the telegram chat groups and say my grandfather or so and so they're in you
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.240]   know stage four cancer going through chemotherapy or they've you know they're like as you know like
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.880]   a later stage you know type three diabetic and you know not doing well but you know whatever right
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.800]   but if somebody is really chronic and they've got like severe dementia they you know all these
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:08:00.320]   chronic problems then turning on energy to them uh you know is there's two things are going to happen
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:08.160]   right the concept of a starting point well if all of this based on the science will give your body
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.360]   an incremental lift in performance in terms of like improving white blood cell count well what
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.240]   does white blood cells do well they go around and scavenge you know viruses and things like that
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.960]   there's also decreasing your parasitic load improving oxygenation I mean all of these things that
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.680]   are actually happening in you well if it's going to happen to someone who's in general good health
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.520]   you know there'll be an incremental lift and they'll feel a little bit better but if you're
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:38.320]   really really really bad off then the issue is is that incremental lift might not do anything I
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:44.560]   mean it's gonna well I mean it's gonna do something but will it be impactful will it turn them around
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.600]   will they wake up tomorrow and jump out a bit you know just we have to be realistic okay
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:56.320]   so for chronic conditions your starting point or their starting point is so bad you know this
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.200]   will help a little but make sure I'm just wanting to make sure everyone's got clear expectations
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.960]   okay but if you're in general go ahead good health it's going to be really beneficial if you're in
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.880]   really really poor health it's going to be beneficial science says it will be but just be careful that
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.360]   a you know the expectations are set realistically and secondly to that whole detox reaction thing
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.240]   you know someone's been undergoing chemo they've had poison pumped into their system and if you
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.880]   start to try to detox that poison out of them too fast you know they're going to get overwhelmed
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:32.480]   there's this whole thing about something called a Herxheimer reaction it's a reaction to a severe
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:39.920]   reaction to a you know detoxing that happens too fast faster than your body can can handle you know
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.720]   and then you have this Herxheimer reaction and you could possibly make someone worse
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.760]   if they're severely chronic and you like you know turn it on full power or put them in a block
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:56.080]   for an hour you know just so be careful okay be careful about the detox reaction and be careful
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.880]   with people who have chronic conditions okay that's the only cautions I want to make sure
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.920]   everyone's really clear level set expectations so now here's the first thing now quantum upgrade
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.480]   is incredible great service and there's lots of different things you could do
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.520]   but it's it's a little bit limited because you can't customize okay but this is what you can do so
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:22.800]   if there's if you are trying to work on injuries illnesses or chronic conditions then really
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.840]   what you're going to do and this is my recommendation is that you're going to want to do energy especially
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.560]   for an injury okay so if for if you have an injury you're going to want to go max during the day
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.600]   low at night now again as I just mentioned though chronic conditions go low low you know but the
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.200]   whole idea though for an injury you want to go max during the day you just want to give yourself
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.720]   that energy having a quantum upgrade subscription to help with your injuries a really good idea okay
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.840]   now in terms of boosting you know if you have an injury you're going to want to do at least twice
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:58.880]   a day at max level you know for as long as you you feel that it feels good for you and then for
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:04.880]   frequencies you know for that I would recommend for injuries the pain reconciliation because you
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.760]   know most first things can happen when you have an injury it's going to hurt so there's this great
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.120]   frequency called pain reconciliation that'll help you manage that pain you know the inflammation
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.320]   inflammatory support because the next thing up right is everything starts to swell up so
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.040]   you want that inflammation support and then using any either one of the two heel frequencies okay
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.720]   now there's two different heel frequencies and I want to just make sure everyone's really clear
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:35.440]   not a lot of people realize this but heel in the Laila world doesn't mean the word heel like
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.800]   healing you know like we're like this whole video is about it actually stands for it's an acronym
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:46.720]   and it stands for holistic experience abundant abundance and love okay and it's their acronym
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:53.760]   for that product but there's two different ones and just a regular heel is more of a general health
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:59.200]   and general better you know getting you know feeling better or having your body you know kind of just
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.240]   kind of be better I guess you know it would be the simplest way to put it it's also heavily on the
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.040]   emotive side you know working on emotions but it's also for physical but it's really kind of that
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:15.360]   source energy stuff right the heel 360 is completely a molecular frequency and that's really designed
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.840]   for actual physical healing okay so if I were to like break an arm or something like that I mean
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:26.320]   if I really had you know like let's say just a you know an immediate injury you know that I wanted
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:32.080]   to work on I would use heel 360 or if I had a long term like chronic back pain I would use regular
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:38.240]   heel okay or heel 360 either one it's great but you know that's kind of the idea behind injuries
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.720]   is you got the deal you have the pain frequency the inflammation frequency and either one of the
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:49.520]   heel ones will be very beneficial for injuries now for if for illnesses as well when you have
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.560]   just like a regular illness the energy the boosts and the frequencies are awesome for that now the
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.040]   chronic conditions again one more time it's a little separate but you want to go load you know
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:04.720]   just be just ghosts just it's all the same stuff but you just want to start really low and work up
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.120]   to that okay but the same idea would be to help with that inflammation help with you know and
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:16.800]   using heel that the heel frequencies are really great for that now in terms of you have a cognitive
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:23.360]   issue so there have been people and there's been studies as well you know ADHD and autism
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.240]   and those sorts of things they've actually had an autism study as you most most of you know and
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:34.000]   in that study they used energy then they used frequency and then they customized their frequency
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.360]   and used capsules you know so everyone got an individual capsule they were wearing and the
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:45.120]   frequency they used was the focus frequency they actually developed that for that study so if you
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.000]   have any kind of issues with you know you know you have somebody or yourself and you're dealing
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.720]   with one of those types of situations the focus frequency is really good another frequency that
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:00.960]   was really used which is also an emotional issue frequency which was also used in other
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.640]   autism types of efforts you know like the actual original pilot that kind of kicked off that
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:12.320]   full the formal study was using the inner piece to frequency and it worked really well
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:19.440]   I was it was just an adult male young adult with autism and we used inner piece frequency
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.000]   for this individual because he had that form of autism which you know he had like you know fits
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.200]   of anger and rage right and inner piece was very beneficial for that individual so you know so
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.240]   if there's an emotional issue that's either tied to cognitive or separate then the frequency of
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:39.280]   inner piece is really great it's really great if you're grieving it's really great if you if you've
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:45.120]   suffered loss you know like breakups and just you know you're just you know all that kind of stuff
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.720]   inner piece will really be very very beneficial for quantum healing that kind of stuff
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:56.880]   opening up your heart chakra is a really great frequency for dealing with emotional issues and
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:02.080]   then resurrection or using the trauma easy service itself I want to point out that there's a there's
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:09.840]   a ton of science behind the idea that trauma gets trapped in our body as as a as a negative frequency
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:15.440]   and then by using these frequencies you can help you know kind of work on that trauma
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.680]   and if you can release that trauma or release that negative frequency and kind of get it out of you
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:25.360]   then it has you know that whatever it's tied to most traumas are tied to physical things
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:31.280]   within the body and you know there's a whole science behind you eliminate trauma you eliminate
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.080]   the physical thing that it's creating and manifesting within your body so you know if you want to kind
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.360]   of heal an emotional issue but sometimes healing trauma can also help you with physical healing
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.120]   okay so now let's talk about the laila blocks in terms of using laila blocks for healing this is
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.840]   where you can get full on creative because you just you know you can create custom stuff but
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.920]   really you know what I want to say is that there's and I'm going to walk you through some case studies
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:01.600]   but the idea here is that you're going to want to charge whatever you hurt and you know and this
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:06.400]   is kind of the guidance this and this is because we know it works it worked on somebody that that
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:12.480]   we know and so you know in that individual you know basically it was how they relieve their issue was
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:20.160]   twice a day 15 minutes each time and that really expedited there you remember now there's a science
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.760]   study that actually proved that it does wound healing that it regenerates it helps the body up to
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:31.520]   almost twice as fast your body will start you know healing the wounds you're healing your wounds
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:36.960]   growing you know regenerative tissue to you know heal wounds and that includes obviously
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.520]   mending bones and things like that so that's what the person did was twice a day 15 minutes
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.200]   or like if you're someone like myself and I hurt my knee once I put my knee in my infinity
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   block and just hadn't watched the whole movie 90 minutes you know that so it doesn't matter you
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.800]   can go longer you know so but the basic the bare minimum I guess is the best way to say it
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:00.080]   is twice a day 15 minutes put the injured part of your body in in your block then you also can use
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:06.720]   photos but I want to clap caveat I mean frequencies that you need to use frequencies with a photo of
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:13.440]   you or whomever you're trying to help okay it's so important you never use a frequency inside the
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:19.200]   block with you in the block okay you don't want to chart you know copy the frequency into your body
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.280]   all right long story short just don't do it I'm going to that later if anybody wants to know
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.560]   but the bottom line is so just when you're using frequencies and blocks and you want to
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:32.880]   kind of send the frequency just like you could with quantum upgrade you want to use a photo of
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.200]   you which is basically emulating what quantum upgrade does so you would take a photo of you
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.520]   your dog your pet your mom your dad whoever you're helping and you put them in the in the block the
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:46.000]   photo of that person in the block and then you put the pain you know the frequency of the card
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.440]   or hopefully you'd copy it to a piece of foil you put the frequency on a foil in the block with
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.920]   the picture of the person pet or whatever and then you're going to basically be able to kind of help
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.880]   them and you basically can help them with their pain you know is a great frequency like I mentioned
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:06.320]   inflammation and any one of the heels okay I have done that quite a bit and the people who I've
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.520]   helped have reported you know that it helped that that they actually felt better and I actually the
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.720]   way I do it is I just put their photo in put the this one individual and I put their photo in and
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:22.000]   put the pain frequency in there and kind of forgot about it and then the very next day I checked
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   up on them and the thing was still in there from the day before and that person was like yeah I feel
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.600]   a lot better like awesome so you can leave them in there I've left my photo I've left people's photos
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:36.560]   in for literally weeks at a time and you know it's not something honestly that Philip recommends
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:43.840]   but that's what I've tried and done I tinker constantly with what's possible and and nothing
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.160]   bad has ever happened with all the tinkering that I've done so let me kind of just show you
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:53.280]   one thing that's this is where that twice a day 15 minutes three years ago Philip's son is a
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:59.200]   motocross racer uh he's young young man great brilliant uh and very accomplished successful
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:04.640]   competitive racer well three years ago in one of his races and motocross Philip's son this is
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:10.640]   Philip Vonholtzendorf the owner operator of Leila Kornetech his son had an accident on the track
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:17.120]   and broke both of his wrists and this was during the racing season okay and so here's a picture of
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:23.520]   him at the ER Philip brought his infinity block to the ER and the first thing he did was put his
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:29.920]   son's wrists in the infinity block both wrists you know trading back and forth 15 minutes twice
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.960]   a day that's where we got that from and so when he did that and of course he else you know he was
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.920]   also doing all the other stuff that the the ER and his doctors were doing but what happened was
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:46.240]   is he continually kept using the infinity block twice a day every day up for like you know for
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.800]   weeks all right but this is what the story goes the doctor was like yeah you're not going to race
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.640]   anymore this season you know the season had months to go and he's like you you have to give up
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:59.120]   racing this year there's just no way you got both your wrists are broken there's no way well
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.440]   guess what he they did everything the doctor told them to do and the doctor said yeah it's
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.000]   going to be like three months minimum before you'll ever write a motorcycle again the kid was back
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.240]   up on a motorcycle in just a few weeks that's how fast he healed and so that's like the success
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.880]   story that kind of kicked off this whole thing when this happened three years ago and it's just
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:26.000]   a remarkable I mean the kid was back on his motorcycle in a few weeks racing and winning his races
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.560]   again that's how fast his his wrist healed after he had broken them and just using the infinity block
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:37.600]   plus whatever you know the his doctor was helping with now you'll also find these by the way all
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:43.280]   these photos I'm showing you are all in telegram just go to the telegram chat group you know the
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.480]   quantum power group click on media and all these photos they're all in there with the other thousands
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:53.360]   of photos so there's now recent cases where one of the members this is right out of that these are
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:59.440]   our members this is you guys somebody posted that they bashed their toe they put it in the infinity
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.520]   block I don't I don't recall how long they had it in but they were using their infinity block to
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:11.280]   heal their toe and within just like within days you know or very rapidly and they this is why they
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.920]   posted it because they were astonished how well it worked was they posted hey this is what my toe
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.720]   looked like and after I used the infinity to block whoa look at all that bruising gone it healed so
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:27.120]   quickly in terms of their bashed toe another individual came in had some kind of a circulatory
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.200]   problem in their hands you could see where their their fingers were going white for lack of a
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.160]   blood flow put their hand in the block and then look at that just it's just you know a major
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:42.000]   improvement in a short period of time so that's the power of quantum energy whether it's quantum
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.640]   upgrade or using a block and applying that energy to you and having this list of incredible effects
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:54.560]   happening to your body you know that whole wound healing thing okay so now the next one I want to
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:01.440]   get to is this one here well we're using Leila Q blocks you know I just covered injury so let's
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.800]   talk about using blocks for illness and chronic conditions cognitive issues and emotional it's
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:13.600]   exactly the same as as that you would do as I mentioned in quantum upgrade all right so you know
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.680]   so not a whole lot of difference instead of quantum upgrade and you turn on that frequency
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:23.680]   you would put your photo in a block remember now use a photo put your photo in the block put the
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.720]   frequency in the block and that frequency is going to go to you in the photo or whoever is in the
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:34.960]   photo okay it's going to go to that person that pet whatever so chronic ill conditions and illnesses
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.680]   you definitely want to do inflammation support because a lot of you know illnesses and chronic
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:45.440]   conditions are related to inflammation so inflammation is great for that you know and you know and
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:50.560]   obviously if you have a block you know you go to the website and acquire the frequency off of the
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.520]   website if you are on quantum upgrade you just you know subscribe to the bundle so but you want to
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.960]   definitely use inflammation and the recommendation is also use either one of the two heal frequencies
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.280]   okay and you know try either both of them and see which one works for you but those are that's the
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:10.240]   approach I would recommend for illnesses and chronic conditions now if you have a cognitive issue
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:17.520]   same thing again photo with the focus frequency and then also with emotional issues photo with
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:23.200]   any one of those three frequencies that help on people on the emotional level so inner peace
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:28.480]   heart chakra or resurrection frequency would be great for that so that's kind of what I would do
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.960]   use your photo use some frequencies put them in the block for these kinds of things and they're
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.280]   going to they're very helpful okay now the other possibilities I do want to recommend in the video
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:43.200]   is the using energy just pure on it you know just if you're just using energy and instead of charging
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:49.520]   you charge your food and charge your water and then that way you're taking in this life force
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:54.800]   energy and you know and it's you know obviously going through you so not only are you charging
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:00.000]   yourself you're charging the sustenance that drives your biology and then specifically with
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.800]   food if you if your chronic condition has anything to do with digestion charge your food just do that
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:12.560]   if you have any digestive problems charge your food before you eat it and and then you will see
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:19.920]   you'll see some results because there's a food intolerance study that showed incredible results
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:26.560]   just by charging food on and that effect on the food when people who were allergic to it or had
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:32.240]   sensitivities to it would ingest the food after it'd been charged so the thing about food now if you're
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:37.280]   using food as a medicine I guess this would be a good explanation you know like food is medicine
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:42.080]   right then you're going to want to charge it longer than what it says in the timing guidelines
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.080]   and what they learned in the study was a minimum four minutes okay an infinity block
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.000]   so that's what you should do okay just giving you a heads up on that but charge your food and water
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.040]   super healthy for your body in general super super healthy if you've got digestive issues that
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.960]   you're dealing with your allergic stuff but more so you know like you know if you have digestive
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:04.480]   issues really helpful. Now in terms of other possibilities using frequency via a photo
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:09.920]   can't stress that enough now the other thing is creating an infosuticle. Now what an infosuticle
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:16.720]   is is the word for when I imprint stuff onto water so I you know and I all of all of the water
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:23.120]   that I drink in my house I have a you know water filter thing under my sink I put it into a pitcher
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.080]   you know I keep two pitchers in my fridge but before it goes into the pitcher it goes into my
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.880]   grand block and I actually imprint the frequency of the vitamins and minerals
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:37.920]   and anti-aging supplements that I take daily so I'm not only am I taking the physical supplements
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:42.720]   I'm imprinting the frequency of the supplements into the water and when you take frequencies
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:48.320]   and copy it to the water you drink that's that's what the word is it's called it's an
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:54.160]   infosuticle because the water has picked up the information from whatever you've copied to it
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.720]   okay that's just where that came from so you can create an infosuticle and you can also do that with
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.440]   any of the medicines you're taking any of the home homeopathic remedies you're taking
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:10.320]   anything any kind of shamanic you know message or whatever you're doing imprint that to the water
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.760]   and then start using that as your as your source of water and so you're drinking the
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.880]   frequency of that healing frequency right you that healing frequency will then you know
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.280]   go with all everything that you drink go to all your cells now the other thing now this is the
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:32.320]   absolute beauty of the blocks is you can customize your own frequencies so give you an example my
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:37.680]   neighbor has a German Shepherd very old German Shepherd struggling with hip dysplasia and so you
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:43.200]   know I that I saw the dog and I was like well you know let me see if I can help your dog and so
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:48.960]   what I did with permission got a picture of the dog and then I went and and I just did the research
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:54.720]   on how do you treat hip dysplasia and got a bunch of natural organic natural non-gimo
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:27:00.240]   you know just align yourself with nature because quantum energy is nature align with it and I just
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:05.440]   kind of made I made up a hip dysplasia booster you know and so it was like inflammation stuff
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:12.320]   was in there and hip support like lacosamine and MSM and all of this stuff that was for you know
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:18.800]   for helping dogs with you know basically orthopedic issues and I put together a booster I created a
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:25.920]   custom frequency just for this dog and then I put the dog's picture in my infinity block with that
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.840]   frequency and it's been in there since for like several weeks now and then also I chatted with
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:35.120]   Philip about it and he's like yeah you see he also said oh on top of that that's good but use the
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:41.200]   heel for dogs frequency on top of that so now I've got in my infinity block I've got him I've
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:48.800]   got that dog in there with my in my hip I'll just call it you know hip dysplasia frequency booster
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.920]   thing I made and then also on quantum upgrade I put the dog on quantum upgrade with heel for
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:28:00.240]   dogs so it's he's getting she's getting double energy two different frequencies and I can tell
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.360]   it's been a few weeks I can tell that she's moving a little bit better but it's chronic it's
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:12.080]   significant it kind of goes back to my original point her starting point on this was bad and this is
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.720]   only giving her a little bit of relief but I can tell because every now and then she'll kind of run
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:24.320]   up to me as opposed to limp slowly and so she's I see I've seen an improvement but it's a slight
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.560]   improvement you know we're not making miracles here we're just trying to help and this definitely
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:34.080]   has demonstrated to help that dog now the other thing too now you can also use your Layla capsules
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:39.280]   this is a really cute picture that was posted in telegram where someone's dog had hurt their back
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.280]   and so the person had placed the capsule over where it hurts and that's the first thing I would
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:49.200]   recommend is a capsule is a pretty strong little thing okay it's not as it's not a block it's
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:54.880]   definitely not quantum upgrade but it's it's pretty it's pretty powerful and so now full five spheres
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.520]   place the capsule over the issue there's also pictures of other people placing capsules on
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:04.800]   their different parts of their body in the media section but this was the cutest one so little
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:10.160]   Frenchie heard his back and the owner put the capsule right on his back to kind of help you know
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.960]   send some quantum energy right to that spot that was hurt in the little dog also you can use
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.600]   frequencies now one of the things about frequencies and capsules is you can customize any frequency
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:25.680]   you want so now there's a method for that it's called using a sphere packet you copy a frequency
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:31.120]   of a medicine or or you know a supplement or essential oil or whatever you want to use
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.400]   you can copy it using the spheres of the capsule in a little foil packet and you can copy it to
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.720]   another piece of foil then you could take that little piece of foil that has the frequency
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:46.160]   copied to it and put that inside your capsule I did a video on that and it's looks at look up
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:52.160]   the video how to use your super capsule okay it's a tutorial that shows you how to do that so
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.560]   using your capsules you can create your own customized foil and that would have been like if I didn't
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:00.880]   have a block and I wanted to help the dog that my my neighbor Sherman Shepherd I could have easily
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.600]   just use a capsule and I could have burned it and I would have put that capsule on the dog's collar
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.360]   if that's all I had to use all right but that's how I would have done it I would have used a sphere
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:16.880]   packet method and using a capsule so that's how you can help and use quantum healing for dogs people
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:22.960]   you know plants even using the Leila capsules that's how you can use the Leila blocks and that's how
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.360]   you can use quantum upgrade for healing so I'm going to leave you here now just want to say thanks
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:32.720]   for watching but I want to just kind of show you a little slideshow I just grabbed like the top 30
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:39.840]   photos in the media section just to show you you guys this is you guys posting pictures
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:45.920]   about how you're using the quantum upgrade and on mostly I'm sorry the quantum blocks
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:51.040]   for your healing and capsules for your healing purposes this is actually Dave Asperin he's got his
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.720]   army I don't know what he's got but he's hooked up doing some kind of blood thing but he's got his
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:59.760]   arm and he's using that for his healing there's also this was a post someone hurt their arm they
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.640]   put their arm in their travel block this lady said she hurt she had a really stiff neck took two
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.120]   rods off for travel block put it on her neck got relief of course people with headaches have put
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.520]   their heads in the block you know there's lots of people with their heads in the block seems to be
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:17.760]   the number one sport is put your head in your block and of course you know this person hurt their
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:23.200]   hand got relief from that I personally once burnt my hand in my kitchen and I stuck it in my infinity
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.600]   block while I was watching TV I don't know how long but whatever whenever I was watching and I
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:32.960]   finally was finished the pain was gone the pain never came back and it just healed from that point
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.360]   of forward and I felt like it healed faster I wasn't timing it or anything but it immediately
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:41.520]   got rid of the pain I mean immediately meaning whatever show I was watching but that's what
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:46.400]   happened to me and you know so yeah it definitely it definitely works you know in terms of helping
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:52.240]   heal faster and pain of course people love putting their pets in their blocks you know so yeah if
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.880]   you have any issues with your health of your pets you know we've got everything from ferrets a lot

[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.920]   an accident or their dog has surgery you know there's lots of reasons why you know it's a great
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   idea to put your dog in the block if you're if you have a small block you can you know obviously
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:21.280]   separate the plates but charging your dog and your cats is something that people really like to do
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.760]   to help their animals feel better and do some quantum healing this is this is an example of
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:30.880]   separating your plates and putting your cat in your infinity block so it fits the whole cat in
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.520]   there and of course birds so you know it's kind of cool what people are posting and what people
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.360]   are doing and just kind of sharing and these are all success stories you know I mean
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:44.560]   that people are like hey I tried this and it really worked I felt better my pet felt better
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:50.000]   you know all that kind of stuff so that's it that's quantum healing with Layla Q welcome to Layla Q
