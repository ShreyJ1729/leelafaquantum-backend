[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   Hello everyone. This is another Carbon 60 video by me, Kay Elmer. This video is an update to kind
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.160]   of bring you up to speed. What I've been doing the last couple of weeks and I just wanted to
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.240]   share that with you because I'm kind of on a holding pattern waiting for some more lab equipment,
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.320]   but nonetheless I keep doing stuff in my kitchen or the Kay Elmer lab as I like to call it. So I
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.280]   just wanted to share with you what I'm learning and because I love reading the comments about
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.000]   what you're learning which helps me and you know this whole body of knowledge thing. So let's jump
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.320]   in. First thing of course is disclaimers. This is not medical advice. This is not a product endorsement.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.040]   I do not sell C60 products so I have no interest. No bias to get any money from you and I don't get
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.920]   I don't get paid. I don't get any endorsements or nothing. This is not about money to me at all.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.320]   It is about sharing knowledge. Okay. The topics of this video is using sunflower oil. I'm actually
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.240]   working through the list of different oils to see what happens and if it works for me, if I like it,
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.840]   etc. So my most recent batch was using sunflower oil. I want to share that with you. And also
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.400]   too I've been trying to perfect the art of salvaging the residual C60 that's left over when you make
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.960]   C60 oil because you know it's so expensive and to leave it behind just just kills me. So I've been
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.360]   really trying to work out what's the best way to salvage that and you know and use it so you don't
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.120]   lose it right. And then also let's talk about sources for C60 powder or C60 raw whatever you
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.400]   want to call it. So anyway let's just jump right in. Hey using sunflower oil. Now what's the coolest
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.320]   thing is and I'm sorry I didn't have a video of this thing. The coolest thing about using sunflower
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.400]   oil was how fast it was and the color that it turned and the most amazing thing is that there
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.040]   was practically no residue. So let me just tell you. I put it in a flask. I mean I think I made
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.080]   500 milliliters of it. And so when I go at one gram per liter that's my kind of basic formula for
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.800]   everything now. It keeps it simple. So I made a 500 milliliter batch. So I put 500 milligrams
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:16.000]   of Bucky Labs C60 powder. And so I started for two days on the magnetic stirrer and then I put
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.160]   it in my ultrasonic cleaner for 30 minutes in eight minute intervals. And what was amazing to me
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:32.240]   is that there was practically no C60 residue in the flask or in the jewelry cleaner. And so
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.680]   I was really quite surprised. And so and then the next thing that was really surprising was
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.000]   like within two days that thing just turned into this beautiful purple. And so what's really weird
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.480]   though it changes colors depending on the light. And so this picture here I took this afternoon
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.120]   in the sunlight to show you that in the sunlight it looks like it's crimson you know like reddish
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.040]   color like you see right there hopefully your monitor is showing this too. And then when you're
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.680]   pouring it or looking at it you know it looks purple. And then when it just sits there straight it
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.240]   looks dark. So you know it's just really weird. It just has all these different color attributes.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.720]   But the cool thing was it's just this beautiful purple crimson color no residue and it's awesome.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.360]   Now the one thing about now so I'm taking this stuff right. And the one thing I've been taking
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.800]   two tablespoons a day for like not two weeks probably. And so one so and that's been fine
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   you know normal normal usage normal everything. But then one day I decided hey you know you know
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.400]   maybe more is better. So I like I drink like a quarter cup of it. And so I want to point out
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.080]   that more is not necessarily better because that the effect of that much sunflower oil on me personally
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.160]   was unpleasant to say the least. So if you don't want to have the entire contents of your digestive
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.840]   system exit your body in 12 hours then you probably don't want to do that. So there's more is not
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.160]   better but two tablespoons a day is working out. And the other thing about more is not better
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.640]   is the reason I went 30 minutes over here is because that conversation I had with Martin from
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.040]   Redline he made a comment and he basically cautioned me and said hey you know if you're going to be
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:21.680]   sonic sonicating the C60 to create that liposomal be real careful not to do it too long because
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.640]   what the energy can do is it actually creates liposomal but if you do it too long it'll break
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.160]   them down and you'll end up having just C60 suspended in the oil as opposed to dissolve. So
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.680]   I used to do it for an hour at a time but my most recent batches I'm only doing it for 30 minutes
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.840]   and look what it look how it came out it came up awesome. So I'm real happy with that. Now here's
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.640]   the economics of it. The coolest thing about this and I just really really really want to try to
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.880]   get this message across which is you know here's what it cost me to buy one liter of sunflower oil
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.680]   $13 I bought it by the gallon there's 3.79 you know liters per gallon so it comes out to 1385
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.200]   a liter and then I bought my the last batch before this most recent one was
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:15.680]   Bucky Labs C60 powder and they were selling it for 110 a gram the 99.95. Now I just recently
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.160]   did a pricing guide I'm going to go over that in a second here where they they bumped up the price
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.440]   now to 130 which you know so but it but when I bought it it was 55 so the total I had invested
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:32.640]   in this batch was you know 6885 and you know when you take that hundred you know this is one liters
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:39.600]   1,000 milliliters you know you divide that by 30 milliliters it's 33.3333 you know bottles you
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.040]   can get 33 of these little bottles out of one liter and you know look at this the price comes down
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.800]   to two dollars and seven cents a bottle and you know there is a commercial there's only one commercial
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:58.480]   C60 product out there that comes in sunflower oil and it sells for 70 dollars so you know the thing
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.000]   I read all the time when I'm watching all those there's tons of not tons but there's at least a
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.920]   dozen or so interviews right either Sarah Westall or somebody else is interviewing the various
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:17.280]   manufacturers of C60 you know a commercial product you know the comment sections I read them all and
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.800]   it there's so many people are just talking about how they can't afford it it's so expensive and
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.480]   and you know and yeah when you look at it's 70 dollars for this little tiny bottle or
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.680]   someone's charging 60 or 50 or 40 you know absolutely you know people are on fixed budgets they can't
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.920]   afford that for a tiny little bottle but my point right here it's make it yourself it's two bucks
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:45.360]   two dollars I mean just think even if your supplies cost 10 times more it still be massively cheaper
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:52.240]   than you if you buy it you know online but I want to quantify that statement it is cheaper
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.560]   yes but it's also home grade and it's not commercial grade so when I made this I'm very
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.880]   satisfied with it and it's doing the job and I'm very happy with it and it cost me two dollars and
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.680]   seven cents for a little bottle but the commercial product out there is I think it's called C60 plus
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.720]   and the guy that makes it is Bob Greska and you know I've watched several of his interviews and the
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.680]   guy is a carbon scientist this guy is one of the two folks that I know that I've seen so far that
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:28.720]   actually could they produce their own C60 and he produces it and he's got it down to because he's
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:35.440]   a carbon scientist where he's actually got it's not even in granular form it is literally a pile of
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:42.640]   carbon atoms you know I mean C60 molecules not atoms and so it's it's so fine he had to develop
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.520]   an entire different process per what he one of his interviews where he had to develop a process
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.720]   just to be able to move it around because it's so fine it's like it's it's you know literally just
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:58.560]   the molecules right a pile of molecules as opposed to you know grains of molecules so
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:06.000]   so you know when he produces his he mentions it his is you know he doesn't say how much C60 is
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.600]   in the bottle but his common is that there's so much that the oil is black mine came out
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:18.480]   do this his comes out black so you know obviously he's clearly a great above you know what I could
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.240]   produce in my kitchen so there is a massive comparison so when you say oh two dollars compared to 70
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.360]   I want to quantify that and say well that's two dollars home grade me and my kitchen versus
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:35.200]   Bob Resca the you know this really smart scientist guy making it commercially and and being able to
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.680]   take it down to the molecular level that he does because he's you know all that equipment and
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:45.520]   brilliance and stuff so there is a reason it's seventy dollars so anyway so you know but I think
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:52.080]   there's an argument here that you might want to make it at home so next thing is the salvaging
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:58.400]   residual C60 so this is what I've been trying and trying in different ways and so the one way
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:04.000]   I kind of come up with is just to add more oil pretty simple but you know when it kind of gets
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.680]   complicated so this is my first my first one was with olive oil I made a batch of of C60 olive oil
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:18.800]   I used one liter of oil and one full gram of C60 it was powder form and the process I used was I
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:24.720]   just tried I stirred it for a whole week and then I put it in the sonic machine for 64 minutes which
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.920]   was like eight times of eight minutes right because the timer only goes to 480 seconds and so I stirred
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.440]   between the eight you know the the different cycles so it ran at eight cycles stir in between with the
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:43.680]   spoon and keep moving it you know and you lost I gotta back up I'm sorry stir for a week means
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.040]   because a lot of you guys probably haven't followed all the videos I've made stir for a week means
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:57.120]   you put the oil in a flask put it on a magnetic stirr add the C60 inside and then turn the machine
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:03.360]   on your stirr and the stirr machine stirs it you know and you cover it with a box or a towel so it
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.560]   doesn't stay in the light and so you just let it sit there and you let it stir for a week and then
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:15.360]   I would take it out of the flask pour it into an ultrasonic cleaner which is this thing and then I
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:22.800]   would run the cleaner for eight times each time goes to 480 seconds and every time that it stops
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:29.760]   I stir with a spoon and then turn the machine back on and I and that comes out to 64 minutes and that's
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:35.600]   the process for making this batch in specific and so what you're seeing right now is after I ran
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:44.080]   all the C60 oil out of the flask in the machine this was at the bottom of the cleaner okay the
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:50.800]   ultrasonic cleaner and so that's what you see so the goal of salvaging the residual C60 is how do I
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.080]   you know how do I use this I don't want to throw it away I've just made a full batch
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.160]   awesome you know looks great but I don't want to throw this away because it's expensive
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.520]   so what did I do so the next thing that I did was I decided to start doing this little technique
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:09.040]   where I would take I would just take whatever was sitting in the jury cleaner you have to wait
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.960]   until the thing cools off you run a little thing like that for 64 minutes it gets hot and you know
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.600]   you don't want to burn it out and have to buy a new one so let it completely cool off give it a
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.560]   few hours and then you start over again and so I just used the residual C60 that was in the bottom
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:29.440]   of the cleaner but I decided okay well instead of pulling you know putting in a full batch of oil
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.720]   let me just go half of the batch so the first batch was a full leader so the second batch that
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.840]   I put in was half of that which was only 500 milliliters and you know it didn't stir first I
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:46.400]   just poured the oil in and I turned it on eight cycles for you know it's eight minutes times eight
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.560]   runs for 64 minutes and between cycles I stirred it with a with a spoon and what you're seeing here
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.760]   pictured is this is just the plain olive oil and this is what the second batch looked like
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:03.600]   so it definitely picks up without having to use a magnetic stir and that's a really important
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.560]   point here is that I didn't use the magnetic stir I just went straight in oil in machine
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:14.800]   turn it on and hey you know this is how how rich and dark that the oil came out the C60 oil
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:20.080]   so that was uh into my you know that I mean that was definitely a success because this looked
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:27.200]   exactly like the first batch and I hadn't been able to you know recover and salvage the residual C60
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.600]   and so now after that second batch this is what it looked like because you know it was like almost
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.560]   there was nothing there but I took a paper towel wiped it out and this was what was left of the
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:42.160]   C60 so at the end of the day the reality is is you're never going to use 100% of it there's still
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.400]   going to be a little bit left I mean yeah I mean you know tried it but you know it's just such a
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:52.320]   little amount but you can definitely salvage the the you know this amount by just putting in 50%
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.400]   of the first one and you're going to get a really good batch on the second on the second
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:02.480]   run so just to do that one more time I tried with coconut oil and so I ran a full batch of
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:09.280]   coconut oil was 500 milliliters with 500 milligrams of C60 that's that one for one formula again
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:17.840]   I stirred it overnight in a magnetic stir I sonicated it for 60 is that even a word sorry I
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:25.520]   I ran it in the machine for 64 minutes eight cycles da da da da stir between and then put that one
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:31.040]   away and it was beautiful purple okay and so what you're seeing now is the next day after I just
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:37.200]   let it sit on the counter and and cool off this is what was in the bottom of the ultrasonic cleaner
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:44.560]   after the first batch so then what did I do well I went and I poured in just plain coconut oil
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:49.600]   into the cleaner it didn't stir it off first I just poured it in the cleaner it was 50% of the
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:55.680]   first batch of the first batch was 500 the second batch was 250 milliliters and I ran it again for
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:01.280]   the same amount of time as I just mentioned stir in between and when the cool thing was was I took
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:06.560]   I I remembered to keep the first batch to make a comparison but this picture here shows you this
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:12.480]   is just what the plain coconut oil looks like it's like practically clear this is the first batch
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:18.000]   and this was the second batch so you know it's just amazing that the second batch actually came
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.480]   out darker and was able to you know you know I guess suck up or you know more the C60 could
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:30.240]   dissolve in that second batch but it definitely came out of darker purple and again you know when
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.800]   I wiped it out it was pretty much the same result this is the odd of olive oil wipe out but it was
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.920]   exactly the same as the coconut oil just a little bit in fact when you look in this thing after the
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.960]   second batch you know you can't even you can see this kind of like a shine you can't really see it
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.640]   you don't notice it until you wipe it out that there's actually something there there's that
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:54.640]   little left so I highly encourage all you guys when you're making your C60 run it a second time if
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.640]   you're not already doing so I maybe just you know preaching to the choir you guys I'll figure this
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.320]   out because it is kind of simple but you know hey I just wanted to share that with you because
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:06.720]   that's what's happening and that's what I'm finding out and and and by the way this these two batches
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.440]   the coconut and the olive oil I just showed you that was before I decided to start going only to
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:17.520]   30 minutes so now I'm pretty much just running everything at 30 minutes and not 60 and as you saw
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:22.880]   good results so with that said now for all you following along at home you realize that it's you
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.720]   have residual in two places one is in this thing after you're done zapping it and the other one is
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:33.760]   in the flask and so I want to talk about that for a second going back to the olive oil batch
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:41.840]   there is a residual amount of of C60 this is after one week of you know this magnetic stirs
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:48.720]   spinning around in a one liter flask with one liter oil and a gram of C60 and I poured it into the
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.720]   machine I had to do it in two batches because those little machines can only do a half a liter and
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.280]   after the you know after I poured it all out and as much as I could try to swish it around and
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.480]   try to get all that you know into the machine this is what's left in the flask and you know and and
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:10.720]   so you know there is definitely a residual amount that will be left behind in the flask so there's
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:16.720]   a couple of thoughts that I have about that and and clearly I had a really great twitter
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:24.000]   conversation about making C60 I think as Chris's name on twitter you go guy and and it kind of
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   we were talking about the metallic taste of the purple power C60 when you make it in an
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.280]   ultrasonic cleaner and it kind of occurred to me that you know I think it's like like a soda can
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:41.600]   you're kind of picking up the taste of this metal and maybe we shouldn't be making C60 in the metal
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:46.320]   and instead just leave it in the flask and so there's a really good idea to that which is like well
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.840]   yeah that's probably true you probably are picking up a little bit of a metallic like taste to it
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.560]   and at the second thing too if you just use just the flask and put the flask inside the inside the
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:03.440]   jewelry cleaner right then you don't have two places where the C60 can be left behind you
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.160]   only have one and you have a little bit better control so that's one thought right so obviously
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.480]   you need a bigger ultrasonic cleaner if you can be doing that so that's the other you know that's
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.840]   the con to that pro is that you have to have a bigger one and I actually have a industrial sized
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:23.280]   one I just haven't broke it out yet I'm waiting for my my next experiment now I'll do a video on
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.800]   my new big one just this is the last batch I ran with the little guy so that's one thought
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.320]   the other thought I want to share with you the fact that look at this here you see these things
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:39.280]   you shouldn't be able to see C60 okay C60 is you use from you know that other video I did
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:46.320]   it's like 60 atoms connected together like a sucker ball you should not be able to see grains
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.240]   and so that was one of the things I was like looking at this thing and I was trying to figure
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.160]   out how do I you know how do I salvage that or what do I do with that and what do you know
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.520]   and then I then I started thinking independently that you know I need to like you know crush this
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.360]   thing in a mortar and pestle or something but all of these little grains need to be grinded
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.720]   down before I put it in the oil otherwise you know these little grains of C60 clump together
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:14.320]   are not going to dissolve and then it was like serendipity that's when I had a conversation with
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.920]   Martin from Red Lion where he was talking about oh he pulverizes his first and that's when I said
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.720]   well I'd like to buy some of that pulverized because that would ultimately solve this problem
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:32.000]   and reduce the amount of residual C60 if it was grounded down you know like pulverized and so that
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.600]   was the start of you know asking him to you know sell me some and then he decided he'd sell me some
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.000]   and now it's listed on his site where he actually sells it to everybody so you know so that's kind
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.360]   of why I got into that hole I want to buy pulverized because you know it's this to me this is a waste
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:53.440]   right here so talking about pulverized the third subject here on this video is talking about the
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:00.880]   C60 suppliers and so I'm gonna make a separate video on how C60 is extracted from coal charcoal
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.000]   or whatever I don't even know what the source materials are so far I'm still working on that but
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.280]   if you go shopping for C60 powder or C60 you know pulverized or whatever this I wanted to kind of
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.960]   share with you that research because I really got deep into it most recently and the first thing
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.440]   that you'll find out other than your options are other than a percent purity is as I go to all
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:27.680]   these different manufacturers and chemical companies that produce C60 raw you know they kind of have
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.920]   like three basic ways that they're selling it and they have the basically regular as they
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:39.520]   basically extract it through reagents right which is using other chemicals to pull out the C60
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:45.040]   and separate it from the C70 and all the other different forms of carbon so they use reagents
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:51.120]   and then they have this vacuum oven purification process where they bake off the the benzene and
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.040]   all these other different elements within it and they finally bake it off to the point kind of
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:00.880]   like distilling alcohol they just they get it down to where it's just C60 left everything's been burnt
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:06.000]   off and then of course then there's that's purified and then and then it's also also the word the
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.280]   other word that I see used in the industry is sublimed so if you see purified or sublime that just
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:18.400]   simply means that when they made the regular they took it an extra step to get rid of all of those
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:24.960]   impurities and then the last one is the pulverized which is you know again red line is the only one
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.400]   that actually is selling pulverized C60 according to Martin they've had to build their own machine
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:37.520]   to do it so it's quite you know prior proprietary so my most recent purchase is the pulverized
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:43.840]   version of C60 I just got it and I'm gonna make a whole video on just how to do that because it
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:49.360]   requires a lot of extra steps if you don't want to screw it up and this stuff is not cheap you know
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.040]   so it looks you know tell me I'll cover that in another video but what I want to share with you
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:59.360]   today is the pricing guide so of the C60 suppliers I put it all together in a pricing guide for
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.120]   you guys out there looking for C60 and or interested in just where you can get it
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:09.840]   cheaper or closer or whatever so let me just pop this guy up and there we go so
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:15.040]   sorry for the visual here it didn't kind of it's hard to kind of show you two separate tables but
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:20.640]   it's important that you'll figure out why and so right up here this table up here is let me walk
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:26.240]   you through it it's the best price per gram based on the purity level up here so I mean there are
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:35.200]   lower purities of like 99.0 but I just 99.5, 99.9, 99.95 and that's kind of where I live is right here
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:41.360]   and then you can actually get 99.99 where they take it to the ultimate level and they just get it down
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:48.720]   to you literally using just pure C60 no other toxins or anything nothing in there in there mixed
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:55.200]   in with it and so that's usually called that's the sublime or the purified version of it so and
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.360]   and then of course the quantity so I kind of have two tables here and I want to share that with you
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.840]   the first table I made was if you only can afford one gram at a time because you know this whole
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:09.040]   monetary issue is really such a big deal to everybody and not everybody can just you know go and buy
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:15.200]   everything you need anytime you want so this one here is basically the lowest the smallest quantity
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.080]   that these these vendors these suppliers will sell you okay and so here's the pricing
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:27.440]   guide for the lowest quantity that they will sell to anybody who asks and what the costs are based
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:32.080]   on percentages so you can kind of take a look at here and you know what's really really cool
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:41.120]   is that I found this materials technology research company and they sell 99.95 for 49
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.960]   dollars a gram I mean that is awesome you know I mean you go to you know just as an example I've
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:53.760]   been buying I've been buying from Bucky Labs my first two two purchases and I was buying it for
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:59.280]   110 a gram and I told you earlier it was they bumped it to 130 so now it's 130 but I was buying
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:05.280]   it at 110 a gram and here's this guy selling it for 49 a gram and that is that's like awesome
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:10.320]   so I go I went ahead and contacted this this company and I just asked him okay well you know
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.280]   how do you guys you know handle there it's not like an online store so you just have to email them
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:22.080]   and then and then say this is what I want you know which which you know purity level how many grams
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.000]   and then they'll send you an invoice and then you can then get back with in touch with them
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   either with it you know obviously if you're a company you'll use a purchase order but
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.720]   you can also use a credit card so if you have a credit card you go and email them what you want
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.480]   which one you want and then they'll send you an invoice and then you get ahold of them again
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.160]   with a credit card I'm assuming you call them and give them your credit card number and and
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.880]   you're good to go and that's how you can buy from these guys oh of course link is provided in the
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.680]   comment section you can link to this document all of these words right here all hyperlinks and so
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.800]   you can just click on it boom there you go so and that's and so that's if you buy one gram so what
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:02.080]   I wanted to kind of point out though for the for those of you guys who have the means that if you buy
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:09.520]   C60 in larger quantities that you can literally save just half half and so this is why there's a
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.680]   second table here because I wanted to point out that this is if you just buy the lowest quantity
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:19.360]   but if you could buy 10 grams or more at these different places you can literally save quite a
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:24.640]   bit so up here is when I do here's the calculation for it and I'll just give you a quick example
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:30.400]   if you buy one gram at Bucky it's a hundred and thirty dollars okay for one gram but if you buy
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:36.640]   10 grams at Bucky the price drops to eighty seven dollars a gram you save 37 percent see how that
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:42.560]   works so you know you can save a lot of money I mean red line if you buy 10 grams it drops to
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.840]   fifty eight dollars at seventy seven cents a gram and for someone like me I've been paying
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:53.200]   110 bucks a gram so fifty eight seventy seven and they pulverized it for me you know hey right on
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:58.640]   that's awesome and so you know I that's totally I dig it but you can even get even lower of course
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.680]   49 these guys don't make they don't materials technology research they don't have a different
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:09.520]   pricing you know guide they don't have a different pricing scheme for bigger quantities it's just
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.800]   it's all or nothing right it's one to ten grams and this is the price same thing with this company
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.680]   called cheap tubes oh I'm sorry the question marks here that means that if you want to order it you
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.400]   got to contact them and and let them know and then they'll tell you what the price is and I just you
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.040]   know I'll leave that up to you guys I just was I was busy and I couldn't email everybody and
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.960]   so I did email a couple other guys and I haven't heard back but anyway so the idea though is you
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.080]   know go ahead and email these guys but these are some of the prices to give you an idea what's
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:40.640]   going on but you know the best one here is amazing is Solaris Solaris is in Canada
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:47.760]   so obviously the shipping costs would be a little different but Solaris up here this is amazing I
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:53.360]   mean if you want to buy 99 but you know the highest quality they go is 99.9 but you know it's 99
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:58.720]   bucks for one gram if you just buy one gram from Solaris but look at how much they charge if you
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:07.120]   drop it to 59 you know for if you buy 10 grams 59 dollars and 60 cents per gram you save 49 percent
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:12.800]   I mean that's just unbelievable how much you could save if you can buy in you know bigger quantities
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.880]   and if you have friends that make this stuff maybe you guys could pull together but you know
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:22.480]   there's a lot of money you can save by buying in bulk go ahead did the link is available in the
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:30.320]   comment section and I hope you this is helpful to you okay so that's that and the last slide is
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:36.800]   the thank you part um hey thank you I really appreciate again one more time all the really kind
