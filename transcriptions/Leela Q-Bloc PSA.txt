[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380]   Hello everyone and welcome to the Tinkers Academy. I'm your host Kay Elmer, and this
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.400]   is not a new video. It's a public service announcement. A couple of weeks ago, I had
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.800]   a great interview with Philip Von Holtendorf at Leyla Quantum Tech about their new product
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.280]   there called the Leyla Quantum Block. Now, that video went an hour and 45 minutes, which
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.320]   was way longer than I anticipated, but it was just such an interesting discussion about
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.160]   this new product. So, what I tried to do is just I just spent the last couple of days,
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.800]   and what I've done for anyone who's interested is that I've broken down the main questions
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.280]   I were asked during that long interview into an FAQ. I put it up on my blog, link below,
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.880]   so that if you want to just go straight to the question that's interest you, I created
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.160]   an overview section of the questions there. Like, what is it? What does it do? How do
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.280]   you know it does what you say it does? How big's that field, you know, all that stuff?
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.040]   And then the user instructions on actually how to use the cube, you know, how long does
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.640]   you charge things for? What can you put in there? You know, how to transfer sound in
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.720]   my favorite, how to use it for quantum entanglement, which is something I am definitely going to
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.960]   be experimenting with, tinkering, and then, you know, purchase instructions. So, right
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.800]   here, you know, this is, if you click on any one of these, like, click on this one, what
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.840]   is the Leyla Cube block? It's going to pop up an unlisted video that you can go ahead
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.560]   and listen to to get the answer to that specific question. Okay, so it's little snippets of
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.160]   the entire interview in FAQ form. There you go. I think it's going to be a lot easier
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.440]   if you had any interest at all in the Leyla Cube block. Now, in terms of purchase instructions,
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.200]   I just want to just throw this out there that I didn't know when I was interviewing Philip
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.120]   is that he's made an offer. Now, so if you go to the website, you know, you'll see in
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.280]   the interview that I think the regular price, like $14.95 for the cube block, and he's got
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.880]   it on sale now. I think he promised to the end of the month, at least, for like $9.99,
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.080]   right? So it's like, like, you know, a third off. But then what he did was is in the telegram
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.560]   chat group for the quantum, you know, the quantum power group, which is our, you know,
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.480]   which is our telegram group attached to Leyla Cube, he made an announcement. And I don't
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.600]   know if everyone caught this, but if you had purchased a product called a cube from Leyla
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.720]   from, you know, from Philip last year, then he's offering any one of you folks, and I'm
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:38.520]   one of them, an additional 50% off to buy the cube block just to try it. So that is literally,
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.880]   you know, I think it's like almost 75% off at that point. So I just wanted to point that
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.440]   out because I'm not sure everybody, you know, read that little, he only posted it once
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.680]   in conversation in telegram, but he did offer, you know, if you bought a cube from him,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.120]   hey, you can get another 50% off the sale price. So I just want to throw that out because,
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.160]   you know, telegram, the way that thing works, right? You, you can jump in and you might
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.320]   have missed like 100 posts, and you just skip it and go to the bottom, see what's going
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:13.600]   on now. So there you go. So that's the cube block FAQ on the blog, and also, you know,
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   that great sale price that he's offered. So it's all good to the end of the month. You
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.200]   know, I don't get anything out of selling cube blocks. I just wanted to let you all
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.800]   know in case anyone was interested in getting one, or you had questions about them. So there
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.760]   you go. And just as an FYI, the infinity block is coming out next week, and I'll be interviewing
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.120]   Philip next Friday just to talk about that puppy and, and you know, just learn a little
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.480]   bit more about it. It's way, it's not way different. It's just different and bigger
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.240]   and stronger than the cube block. So that'll be interesting conversation. And I'm looking
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.240]   forward to that. And I will definitely have that up next weekend. And other than that,
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.360]   Aloha. Have a good day.
