[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.920]   A lot of everyone and welcome to another video by me, Kay Elmer, and today I've got Philip
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.120]   on Holtzendorf with us, and we're going to be talking about the new Leila website that
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.720]   we wanted to share with everybody along with some of the new Leila quantum products.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.320]   So Philip, good morning.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.320]   How are you today?
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.320]   Hi Kay.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.320]   Good morning.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.880]   I'm looking forward to this.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.880]   I'm doing fine.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.880]   Awesome.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.960]   So let me just, for those of you who are new, we're going to be talking about Leila Quantum
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.200]   Tech, a quantum energy healing, I guess it's really hard to describe, and I don't still
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.400]   have my elevator speech on how to explain it to people, but that's all about quantum
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.280]   healing and just the power of feeling better.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.920]   I guess this is right here on their website, feel better, perform better, live better,
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.640]   and I think that's a really good, real short way of just saying, "Hey, this is what it's
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.040]   all about."
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.200]   So I just wanted to share with everybody, let's see, I am looking for new websites.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.240]   So I'm just kind of, so this is, I just want to show you a picture of Philip.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.040]   This is the Leila Quantum Healers Network, and Philip, right here, right here in this
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.080]   little corner, he's the owner operator at Leila Quantum Tech, and so he gave me a call
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.280]   this morning and said, "Hey, we're having a new website, so let's talk about it."
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.840]   And definitely, let's talk about some of those new products, which I know everyone's
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.000]   really excited to hear about.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.400]   So where would you like to start, Philip?
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:32.360]   Well, maybe just really at the home page, and I just want to tell people that we've updated
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.280]   the design to make it look nicer.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.880]   We think at least it's a lot nicer and a lot cleaner.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.840]   It's easier to navigate, and we updated the whole copy also throughout the website.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.720]   I mean, there are some sections where obviously there aren't any real updates because it was
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.560]   already in the way we liked it, and we thought that it's great for everyone visiting both
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.080]   side to understand it, but we've updated most of the copy actually, and yeah, try to make
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.760]   it easier for people to understand what we offer, where to find things, and to understand
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.000]   what it is also that you're looking at, and yeah, I hope you really, you all enjoy the
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   new site.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.800]   It's been a lot of work, and yeah, I'm really thankful for everyone that helped with this.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.120]   Yeah, it looks really nice.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.640]   I only got to, for those of you listening, I only have been looking at this for literally
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.760]   about 20 minutes, so it's all completely brand new to me as well.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.800]   So yeah, this is pretty nice, it's very, very pretty, very, very pretty site.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.680]   So let's get started in what the new features are.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.880]   So well, for those of, I guess there's a lot of people that are brand new to our chat group
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.760]   and brand new to Layla.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.840]   So let me, if I can just kind of just start off with just, in my mind, I'd like to just
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.400]   just say, hey, what is here, you know, and jealous to do an overview.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.480]   So right here, you've got the shop and the product section.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.960]   So if anyone is interested in just going straight to like, okay, well, you know what
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.040]   you want, because you heard about it in the podcast, you can go right here and click on
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.840]   any one of these categories, correct?
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.760]   So if I were, you know, this is the hot one right now, the travel block, or you can just
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.600]   click on shop all to see what everything is, you know, what all of the, all of the different
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   products are.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.760]   But let's say right here is one of the newer products.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.400]   For those of you just interested in shopping, and you've heard about what you want.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.800]   And so this is the, this is the new way of doing it, which is basically a description
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.120]   of the product, and a lot more information about each product individually.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.720]   And then of course, if you wanted to then jump over to the product page where you purchase
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.640]   these things, just click on, oh, that's not working yet.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.640]   Okay, well, we'll give that.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.120]   Oh, yeah, that doesn't work because we're in the test site.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.360]   Sorry, everybody.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.160]   So the shop all pages where you would go to that, by the way, yeah, we're actually.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.880]   And then everyone listening, of course, you will be able to go through those links then,
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.400]   but indeed, where we're currently, the team is currently working on transforming this
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.160]   site, uploading this as we're working on the test site currently right now, K and I.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.480]   It'll be up in about three and a half hours.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.560]   So okay, so then this is basically the all product page for those of you who just know
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.560]   what you want.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.640]   And then you can go ahead and click on any one of these, get some product info, and then
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.320]   of course, add it to the cart and go from there.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.920]   So the other thing here, I just want to do some high overview is the how it works part.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.000]   And this is a brand new section, I think, right?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Because I didn't see this.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.320]   I don't recall this on the old one where you just had research, but you didn't have any
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.000]   had examples of use, but I guess these are some of new features as well.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.720]   And these are just, and then testimonials.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.040]   You guys are now collecting, are you collecting testimonials from direct feedback or and, and
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.600]   or from our telegram chat group?
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   Is that how?
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   With this.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.120]   So all, all testimonials that you see on the website are all approved testimonials from
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.320]   people that gave us their consent to also display it.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.320]   And the idea here is, and I don't know if it's 100% working yet on this test side, but
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.240]   the idea is that you have not only some examples here, but that you can really search hundreds
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.520]   of testimonials that there are per product.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.800]   So this will ultimately be the case so that you can pick, let's say, the heel capsule
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.280]   and you can then see all the different testimonials that we've gotten for that, which should be
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.600]   dozens.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.240]   And then yeah, the FAQ is obviously something I'm very excited about because people have
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:56.000]   been asking for a very long time, and we worked on this, and it was just a hard process.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.080]   And it was hard to put it in a good format and also get the copyright.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.040]   And I hope that we have, you know, the most important questions there answered in a good
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.480]   way for everyone and we're going to be happy to keep adding to it, if there's anything
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.480]   to add.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.680]   No, really helpful because as you folks in the chat know, you know, like myself, Emma,
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.480]   I think there's a couple of new folks that are helping out from Layla as well.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.760]   But you know, the number one question people, I see the brand new coming in, is they just,
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.360]   they want to know, you know, well, has it worked for you guys?
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.480]   And I want to just flat out say that, you know, I've been in the chat group since I
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.800]   think I was a third member of it, and people have been asking that question for the last
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.280]   year and a half, and the answer is, you know, it's in the chat.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.280]   But it's really nice that you're going to pull it out of the chat and put it onto websites
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.160]   so people don't have to scroll up and down.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.400]   But you know, these are real life folks that are just like you, that use these products
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.600]   and then basically come into Telegram, unsolicited, and say, hey, this is how it's working for
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.600]   me.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.040]   So it's great that you, this is a completely new section for anyone who's interested in
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.040]   it.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.040]   Like, what did other people say?
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.040]   It's not marketing.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.400]   It is just literally taking people what they've said with their permission and putting it
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.400]   on the site.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.400]   So that's great.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.000]   The fax is brand new as well.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.240]   So that's great that we have that now.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.720]   The about us part here is, you know, who Layla is.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.600]   Of course, I was showing you the healer network thing.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.160]   That's I continually always like to focus on the healer network.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.840]   For those of you who've only heard Philip talk on a podcast, you know, be aware that,
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.520]   you know, there's, there's a whole group of people that are behind Layla that contribute
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.000]   to the frequencies, contribute to the products.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.960]   And it's, it's a, it's a group of healers, very, very talented, gifted people from all
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.400]   over the planet that have come together.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.680]   And it's not just, you know, like a, a one man type of thing.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.720]   So now this learn section, I know is new as well.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.520]   So could you describe that?
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:05.760]   Yes. So there we finally have a list of the various podcasts.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:12.040]   And yeah, you've done a great job of showing that on your website, and we've been also
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.040]   always asked, so, so where can we find that, right?
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.520]   And we have these pin posts on the telegram group for the latest ones.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:24.360]   But now here there's at least a section where you can scroll through the various different
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:30.720]   podcasts that, you know, we've introduced the quantum technology or were invited to talk
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.960]   about frequency medicine and stuff like that.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:40.240]   So yeah, you can find that all there and I'm grateful we're starting to have it there.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.360]   Yeah, you're a very busy person.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.800]   I'm, I've, because for those of you who know that, you know, in the chat, I've actually,
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.560]   because this didn't exist until now, I was kind of tracking it on my blog so that if
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.760]   anybody was interested in wanting to, you know, listen in on other discussions that Phillip
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.480]   had had, it's on my blog as well.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.200]   So now it's going to be on the website, which is awesome.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.600]   So even more information and just, you know, if you just want to hear what's going on,
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.280]   because Phillip, I mean, every single time you talk, you know, there's some stuff that,
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.560]   you know, we've already heard as a group, but then you're always throwing in new stuff,
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.400]   the newest study, the newest product, the newest findings, the newest feedback.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.720]   So, you know, I listen to every single one because I learned something every time you
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.000]   have a, you have a discussion with somebody and it's, it's really, it's just fascinating,
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.840]   especially the moment, you know, it's every time I can't even pick one out, but man, every
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.200]   time you talk, you're talking about like, hey, this is what we're learning.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.600]   And it's, it's pretty amazing.
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   So that's, that's the learn section and then of course, contacting Layla.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:45.280]   So is there anything you want to highlight here, just on a general overview?
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.840]   But really, just to encourage everyone to take a look and especially some of the things
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.280]   that you've missed in the past, hopefully they're there now and check it out and yeah,
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.800]   let us know how you like it.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:07.600]   And then maybe if you want, we could go into the new products even.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.160]   Yeah, no problem.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.160]   Okay.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.200]   So here we go.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.000]   So I'm going to go to the, the shop all.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.480]   So this is the overall, this is like the store part of the website.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.400]   And let's talk about your new products because that, you know, there's always something new
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.520]   and that's what's really cool.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:31.000]   And so obviously the number one new cool thing is this travel block as a travel and car block.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.040]   So that's the first new thing that's popped up.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.080]   It's going to be available as of today after 3 p.m.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:43.680]   dish central standard time, hopefully you get this video out right about the same time.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.280]   And let's talk about this.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:52.080]   This seems to be the thing that, you know, a lot of folks are asking about lately in the
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.080]   chat.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.080]   So how would you kind of describe this and share this with everybody?
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.680]   So I'm really happy that we finally have it available.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:07.320]   And it's really also a product that, you know, came to existence because people asked for
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.880]   it and people said, hey, you know, do you have a smaller version?
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.120]   What if we travel and, you know, also in the car and things like that and it really took
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.920]   us some time to get to it.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.160]   And it's, it's a very unique product.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.280]   It's, you know, I, I have it with me all the time.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.720]   If I go to town or something, it's literally in my car.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.000]   But if I travel, now I have it with me, I traveled to Germany, you know, three weeks
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   ago.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.480]   So, and I literally had it with me all the time and it was just awesome.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.280]   I really loved it.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.200]   And we designed it in a way that it looks like a small quantum block.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:51.560]   But the power inside is exactly like the basic infinity block.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.320]   So that's very unique.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.360]   So it's small, but it's very, very powerful.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:03.160]   So that also means that the charging times, if you, you know, put a glass of water in or
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:11.160]   you, a raspberry or whatever, is really the same as with the infinity block and not with
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.720]   the quantum block.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.880]   That also means you wouldn't want to put pharmaceuticals in there, right?
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.080]   So don't make your quantum frequency medicine with this one.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.800]   But at the same time, this has a very, you know, strong core.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.600]   The radius, though, is smaller than the infinity block.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.760]   So that's also unique.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:42.120]   It's about 100 to 200 meters and, you know, the actual, you know, EMF harmonizing radius
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:50.480]   is 100 meters, which, okay, 100 meters is about, I think, 330, 340 feet for people in
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.720]   the U.S. and, yeah, that's pretty much it.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:00.360]   There's actually one, one other important feature that I don't think is even highlighted
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.800]   here yet.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:08.960]   But it is, it has something in it that we're programmed in that's, that's a new development,
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.960]   basically.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:16.080]   The, you know, Roman and I worked on for a few months and the current quantum blocks
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.120]   and the infinity blocks don't have that feature yet.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:29.800]   So what it does, it's even more harmonizing as the infinity block and the quantum block,
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:36.360]   meaning you can put even someone in there with a picture that has not been exposed to
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:44.160]   quantum energy before and you can leave that person in there for way longer than you could
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:54.320]   with a regular infinity block just because it, it's sort of the just to the exact needs
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:14:01.880]   of that person in that moment, meaning it won't overwhelm their nervous system at some
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:10.000]   point or make the detox go crazy through the roof, which, you know, could happen with
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.120]   an infinity block of their, you know, someone that's never been exposed to quantum energy
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.160]   and never worked with energy before and then suddenly puts their hand in the infinity block
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.080]   for two hours, you know, that could be quite overwhelming for that person because it's
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.560]   so much of that subtle energy.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:35.520]   And with a travel block, you can have your hands in there for way longer.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.520]   Okay.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.520]   Awesome.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.420]   So I think the funniest thing though, as you're talking, I'm looking, this is your wife.
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.420]   This is crew, right?
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.020]   Is it not a curb?
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.020]   Yes.
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:51.000]   So did you, this is when you guys went there close to Rika and you guys took it with you
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.160]   or she takes it wherever we were, right?
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.160]   I think so.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.080]   I couldn't even remember that he had to take service and someone ended up on the website.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.800]   I didn't even pick it, but it's, I think it's great because it fills it in action.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.000]   It shows a little bit the dimensions.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.280]   That's not, I think it's cute.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.360]   I mean, this is like, this is what crew looks like when she's traveling, everybody is clutching
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:16.680]   her travel like sitting on the curb in Costa Rica waiting for a cab or something.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.680]   Okay.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.680]   Sorry.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.680]   Sorry.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.680]   Side, side, side, side.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.680]   Okay.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.680]   So with this thing, so it's a tiny little.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.680]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.280]   And by the way, before I forget that, so it's $888.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.880]   But for everyone that already owns a quantum blog or infinity blog or obviously infinity
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:40.040]   blog package, you will get 22% off.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.360]   And we've been asked before, is this not forever or is this just for the, you know, first month?
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.600]   And I can't tell you that, but it's definitely going to be for the first couple of months
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.880]   for sure.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.880]   And then we'll look at it.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.520]   And yeah, what you need to do is here, actually on the life side, I think you'll be asked that
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:08.200]   someone to provide your email address and the system will double check if you've had
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   that before.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:15.120]   I hope technically it'll all work like that and there shouldn't be any issues.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.120]   Okay.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.120]   All right.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.120]   Good to know.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.520]   And thank you for your generosity.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:25.040]   I know these, you've gone through quite a bit to get this manufactured and on the market.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.120]   So thank you so much for that as a block owner, Mahalo.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.120]   Okay.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.440]   So this is the new product.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.640]   And one of the questions, you know, as I was reading this in my quick 20 minutes, one of
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.640]   the first thoughts that I had was, you know, it's got that new attribute.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.600]   So I was wondering, you know, like I'm a, I'm a, I'm a block owner right now and you've
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.080]   got this new attribute, you know, I guess, is there a way, or are you, are you planning
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:54.920]   on, on a way for existing block owners to be able to embed that new attribute into our
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.360]   our blocks that we have now in the future.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.000]   Because it sounds like this is a little block and it's got something really special about
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   it.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.720]   So the, the, the first answer is whether the quantum blocks and infinity blocks in the
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.480]   future will have that feature.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.280]   I don't know.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.280]   Okay.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:24.560]   For the current, uh, quantum block, infinity block owners, if we can add that feature,
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.720]   we also don't know that for certain, we're working on that.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:32.640]   And if we can, then we will do it, um, and, and offer it and let everyone know.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.640]   But at this point that has been figured out, I don't think it's actually necessary for the
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.880]   quantum block, to be honest, I, because it also messes with the strength a little bit.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.560]   So, um, I don't, I don't really think it's necessary for the quantum block because there,
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.240]   I mean, you could literally be in there for a very long time in terms of those quantum
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.560]   consciousness levels, but with infinity block, it would be very nice to have that.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.840]   And there's a maybe a possibility that through our quantum upgrade service that we will be
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.840]   launched.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:11.320]   And we may have the possibility to actually do a remote upgrade for those infinity blocks.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.720]   It's just something we're, we're not quite there yet.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:19.920]   So I would say that will take me another 30 to 60 days to be able to definitively say
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.180]   yes or no.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.180]   Okay.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.180]   All right.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.180]   No problem.
[00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.180]   Um, so we'll look forward to hearing about that.
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:31.920]   So basically, you know, uh, we've got a, a small travel block that's equates to an infinity
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.600]   block in terms of capabilities and strength, but it's smaller.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.280]   So it has a smaller field.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:41.760]   Um, and for those of you obviously who are aware, you know, we have the tutorials on
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.760]   blocks.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:48.520]   So if you want to consult charging times, uh, and, and all the different stuff, people,
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:53.040]   that's crystals, whatever, all the different things you could put into an infinity block
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.000]   applies to this tiny little block.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.440]   So keep that in mind that just treat it like an infinity block, um, that you can carry around
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.440]   with you easily.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:07.000]   So that's, that's going to be really key is because we did, um, Philip and I did, um,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.920]   a block tutorial, I think back in February.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.120]   And so it's got all of the charging times in there.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:16.760]   Um, and you can access any of that information, uh, just going to the chat and we posted all
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.760]   the time.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.760]   Okay.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.000]   So I know that's, that's going to be a big question on how to use, how to use my travel
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   block.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   All right.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.720]   Um, one, one other thing I want to say because so for people, sometimes it's hard to imagine
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.600]   a how, how big is this really?
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:37.240]   Even though you see the picture there, but so everyone knows these small water bottles,
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.240]   right?
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.560]   These, you know, what most people would drink when they get a water bottle.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:49.360]   Um, and those fit perfectly inside, not with the length of course, but, um, with their
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.360]   width.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:56.000]   And, uh, so you basically, you'll get them half in and that's already enough actually
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.480]   because you'll just leave them in and in the water, uh, it's charged perfectly.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.480]   Okay.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:07.520]   And so you know a little bit, so small water glasses, you can fit them in and, uh, and
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.520]   all that.
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.560]   Okay, so if I put it on the side and I just put my cup, I like, let's say a tall bottle
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:18.020]   into the travel block, just the bottom part of the bottle being in the, in the block will
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.600]   charge the entire contents of the bottle.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.600]   That's what you're saying.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.040]   It's like, exactly like sticking my, and then the same thing goes with my hand.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.240]   If I put my hand in the travel block or any block, it's going to charge my whole entire
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.120]   body because it's all connected, right?
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.120]   That is correct.
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.480]   And then, um, your hands are connected.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.840]   Yes, and then obviously you can put pictures in.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.400]   So if you're traveling somewhere, you're on vacation and yeah, you just want to put yourself
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:47.240]   in there, for example, just take a picture and fold it a few times and put it in.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.680]   So that's, that's all still possible.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.440]   So she's holding it like this and she's basically charging yourself without thinking about it.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.440]   Right?
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.440]   Yes.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.440]   Okay.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.440]   Great.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.040]   So a, and just to let you guys know here, um, I, I keep this, we're gonna, I'm sure we're
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:06.200]   gonna be adding or you're gonna be adding this kind of information to the website, but
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.120]   just whatever is not on the website, I try to compensate because it takes so long develop
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.160]   all this stuff and the information that needs to go on the website.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.440]   So as kind of like what I do is I, I just, you know, I'm an independent person that,
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.080]   but I support Layla.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.120]   And so if you look on my blog, you'll find the charts that I was talking about at the
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.600]   tables on the charging times between the key block and the eye block.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.040]   So links to this are always going to be in the chat, just ask for them.
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.280]   So you'll be able to see that and, and then go from there in terms of like how to use
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.280]   it.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.280]   Okay.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.280]   And then so that's that.
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.680]   So yeah, that's really cool.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.680]   So then, okay.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.880]   So this is the new block.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.680]   It's going to be for sale as of today.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.920]   It's more on May 13th, 2022.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.160]   And you've only got 160 in stock and there's an incredible discount for people who already
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.160]   own one.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.680]   So this sounds really cool.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.680]   Okay.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.680]   So let's talk about the other, the other new stuff that you've got, you've got going
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.520]   on, that's new products that are on the site as of today, getting a lot of questions about
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.520]   this one too.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.520]   Yes.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.280]   You've got a new water bottle now.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.280]   I noticed.
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.280]   Yes.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   So you can.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.280]   Go ahead.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.680]   Well, my first question was is like, I've got one of the original ones.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.960]   So are you going to stop selling the original ones and just go to these ones now or because
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.480]   I didn't see the original ones on the site?
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.480]   Yes.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.960]   We just phased out the old ones and they're not available anymore.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.320]   I think we still have some stock of the magenta ones.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.560]   We completely ran out of gold.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:42.000]   And so we're actually thinking to ship those that we still have to Europe and keep them
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.640]   going there for a while because yeah, it's just hard to manage two different inventories
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.120]   of shops.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.000]   And so this will be the only one that's on the main shop now and ultimately also the
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.440]   only one on the EU shop.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.920]   It's a different bottle, but it's also the same.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.760]   So it's the same in terms of the frequencies.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:11.200]   So it remains the same because that was from our perspective perfect to begin with in terms
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:17.120]   of the frequency mix and it's an optimal mix for just humans to take in water with these
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.160]   frequencies and that type of energy.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.400]   So we didn't see any reason to change that.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.680]   The same is also that it has a double wall stainless steel in the inside.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:34.040]   So your tea will remain hot, your cold drink will remain cool in there.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:39.560]   What is different is that the outside we feel is, we really like the design.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:40.560]   It's very special.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:47.000]   It's bamboo because it's actual bamboo on the outside and it looks really nice.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.800]   And it is also a little bit smaller.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   So that it's 500 milliliters.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:24:00.520]   Now we probably need to look on Google real quick to tell you what that is an ounce right.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:05.560]   I forgot about that.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:16.840]   So let me do that real quick, milliliter two ounce.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:27.520]   So here we go, 500 milliliter is, well, 17 US fluid ounce.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.280]   That's pretty much what it is, it's a little bit smaller.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:37.200]   It also means it's even easier to take it to yield or have it in your car, etc.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.200]   Okay.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:42.840]   So it's a typical smaller water bottle because the existing one is 750 milliliters, right?
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.840]   3/4 of a liter.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.640]   Yeah, it's not quite 750, but a little bit more than 700.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.640]   Yes.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.640]   All right.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.640]   All right.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.000]   So got the new water bottle.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.040]   You know, hey, I'm sorry, I just, I had a question that popped up in the chat.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.280]   So let me just ask you right now so people can hear about it.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:06.280]   The travel block, because it's the same strength as an infinity block, which for those of you
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:10.680]   who don't know the difference, it's like seven times stronger than the Q block, right?
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.680]   Quantum block.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.880]   But one person or actually if several people have asked is because it's like an infinity
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.280]   block, can you upgrade?
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.800]   If you had two, could you, could you upgrade them, you know, like, like you would an infinity
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.800]   block?
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.360]   Could I take one and travel block and put it in another to put the plates in it and then
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.000]   upgrade my travel blocks just like I could with an infinity block?
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Is that pumped?
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.280]   No, it, that would not work.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.720]   Same with a quantum block doesn't work.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   Okay.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:45.760]   So the only, so if you're looking to tinker, that's how I put it with greater and greater
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.840]   and greater levels of consciousness and, and you want to tinker with stronger and stronger
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.320]   infinity or blocks in general, then the only choice is the infinity block because those
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.920]   can get upgraded every time you put one in the other, it gains strength by seven.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:05.160]   Sometimes, but the quantum block and the travel do not have that capability, right?
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:06.160]   Exactly.
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:11.120]   However, you could, if let's say you have an infinity block package and you're ready
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:18.080]   at a, you know, number six, for example, six generation infinity block, then at some point,
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:27.560]   if you want to have a stronger travel block, you could charge this one in that infinity
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.720]   block and it'll make it stronger.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.960]   We couldn't tell you then, though, exactly what the levels are that you'll come up with
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:44.320]   then because it's not been tested, it's not been done, but in theory, you know, you can,
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.320]   you can do that.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.320]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.200]   That was actually another question to somebody asked if we could take a, if you, what would
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.480]   happen if you put the travel inside, inside of an infinity block.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:57.280]   So you'd literally would upgrade it, but we didn't, but you don't know what to what level,
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.280]   right?
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.280]   Yes.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.680]   And it also, and also depends on what level of infinity block you've got.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.040]   So all, you know, it gets really complicated, but yeah, okay.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.240]   So you can make it stronger, but you can't, you can't take two and make each other stronger.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.280]   But if you had an infinity block, you could take it and put it in there.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.280]   Oh, good to know.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.280]   Okay.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.280]   There's so many.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.280]   Well, I think we're going to have to update our, I'm thinking, you know, we'll update our,
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:24.440]   our block tutorial to try to do like a comparison of the three to kind of clarify what the
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.920]   differences are like we did with the block tutorials.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:28.920]   Okay.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.760]   So then the other new thing that you've got on the site I noticed was the screws are
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.200]   now available, the infinity block screws.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.200]   Yes.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.200]   Finally.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:44.760]   What people have been asking about that ever since our last talk, I got mine and I absolutely
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.760]   love it.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.800]   And let me ask you a question about these.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   Okay.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.640]   First of all, for those of you who don't know what these are is if you, if you look at the
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.400]   infinity block, okay, it's got three plates top and bottom.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.340]   And the three plates top and bottom are connected with rods.
[00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.140]   This is what it looks like assembled.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:06.520]   But if you want to charge bigger things like you want to charge, you know, you know, anything
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:11.400]   you, you know, like you, like an air filter or anything like that or water heater or whatever,
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.480]   then you need to separate the plates.
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.760]   But the problem is is how do you keep the three plates together and up until now, everyone's
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.960]   been using zip ties.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.080]   So that's what the screws are for.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:27.380]   So I guess a question about, about the screws that I've seen people asking is A, when are
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.380]   they available?
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.040]   So they're going to be available today.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:35.280]   And then the second thing was once I separate the plates, this is a question that people
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.280]   have had.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:41.040]   Once I separate the plates and I've got, you know, both sides, a top and bottom now connected
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.780]   to each other, but there's no, there's no rods, right?
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:49.080]   And I put them into alignment, you know, is there any kind of like a delay?
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.000]   Because you know, I took it apart and I put it back together without rods and I have to
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.760]   keep them and the whole concept is if you check out the block tutorial is you need to
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:04.160]   keep the plates in alignment, right, to create that field, that consciousness field.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.520]   Is there a delay when like, there's, there's like a startup warm up period where you want
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:14.600]   to wait before you try to charge anything between two separated sets of plates?
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:22.640]   So yeah, so first of all, the alignment, you want to keep for the upper three plates as
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.480]   well as for the lower three plates.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:33.240]   And then you want to have just somewhat of an alignment for, you know, those separated
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:38.880]   three plates then, if that makes sense, so but that doesn't need to be like super exact
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.680]   because the energy finds its way.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:46.760]   So you could even, you know, they would still need to be facing each other.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.400]   But if one is, you know, three inch to the left and the other one is three inch to the
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:57.720]   right, it'll still, it'll still create that field in between.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:03.320]   So that's the first thing, but obviously the upper three plates, the lower three plates
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:04.480]   need to stay in alignment.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.800]   That's why we have those screws and then you will use, you will continue to use those
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:14.480]   screw nuts in order to keep the separation of those three plates.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:21.000]   Then I would, I would, you know, put the plates the way you want it.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.360]   Let's say you want to lay in between those plates, you put it down and I would say, you
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:31.120]   know, just wait a minute just in case and that, that should be totally sufficient for the
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.280]   field to be, to be up and running.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:38.480]   Now if it's, if you just purchased an infinity block and you're putting it together for the
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:44.160]   first time and that's how you want to get started, then I would wait for about an hour
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.520]   until the field is fully established.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:54.040]   But usually we recommend to putting it together first with, with the rods and have it be established.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:58.920]   And then at some point, if you want to do these other things, you know, just go about that
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.920]   then.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.920]   Okay.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.920]   So I'm sorry.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.920]   Could you repeat?
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.080]   So when I first assemble the infinity block with the rods, how long should I let it sit
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.440]   before I start using it to charge stuff?
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.440]   One hour.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.440]   One hour.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.440]   Okay.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.860]   In the beginning, we thought, you know, it can take up to 12 hours possibly, but our
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:21.440]   experience has been now that it usually after one hour, it's pretty much all there.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:27.240]   Okay. And then if I take the rods off and put the plates together, two sets of three,
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.400]   then it's like, give it a minute, right?
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.880]   Once I put them into alignment with each other.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:39.440]   Okay. And then I've seen a question recently about, do I need to, when I, when I create
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:45.560]   the separated plates with no rods, do I need to put the three plates top and bottom exactly
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.400]   like they were when they were assembled?
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.400]   Like,
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.000]   No, that's not necessary.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.400]   You can mix and match top and bottom plates.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.400]   It doesn't matter.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.960]   Once you put it together, it's together.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.560]   And then does it matter if it's all like the Mandela facing in the right direction in
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.560]   the same direction?
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.920]   Do they have to be all facing in the same direction?
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.540]   Does not matter from an energy perspective.
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:12.320]   We do suggest though that the Mandela always faces upwards just because it looks nicer
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.200]   that way, but that's maybe personal preference.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   Okay.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   That's my, I like to keep it pretty.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.200]   Okay.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.800]   And then I guess the other thing too, once you separate your plates, is there a maximum?
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.760]   I mean, have you enrollment kind of determined what a maximum distance between the plates
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:33.440]   are before you don't have a field or, you know, like, like if I wanted to do like, you
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.920]   know, like a house or something.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:41.000]   Yeah, I don't know that because we didn't test the maximum levels.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.680]   We just know that four or five meters is no problem.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.680]   And what would that be?
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.280]   That's, you know, I don't know.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:54.900]   15 feet, 12 to 16 feet or so, it should be a problem whatsoever.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.080]   But again, I don't know about a house.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.080]   Okay.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.080]   So definitely you could do a car front to back.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.960]   And then if you, it was just a good question.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:10.360]   If you did a car front to back, you'd have to do the whole, you'd have to move the plates
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.680]   around real slowly, right?
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.080]   Cause it's like, you want to do like three minutes and then three minutes and three minutes.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.720]   If you want to take the whole car, right?
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.880]   It's a little bit tricky.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.000]   So I would, yeah, I would just use the traveling car blog for that.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   The car.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   I just take a picture of the car and put it in the cue block and I'm done, right?
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.380]   You know, I know, but I, I know somebody that actually built a jig, a rig, you know, that
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:41.400]   held the plates and they drove their car through it real slowly.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.320]   And they kept lifting it up and they drove it, you know, they literally charged.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.760]   Like, like, like you would put a rock in a, in a cue block.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:53.680]   They'd charge their entire car very slowly, uh, between, and drove it between these plates,
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.680]   right?
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.680]   That's awesome.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.320]   And they built this thing that held the plates up because they wanted to charge their car,
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.320]   which is cool.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.320]   I mean, that's totally cool.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.320]   Uh, okay.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   Okay.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.320]   Great.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.280]   So, uh, so these are the three new products, right?
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.280]   Yes.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:13.520]   And we, we were going to also launch the focus card.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.720]   And yeah, I've posted that in the group.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:24.480]   Oh, that was a little bit of a, a personal disaster because it, uh, yeah, I, I could
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.320]   not find the frequency anymore.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:31.560]   We had worked so long, um, on that one, actually, it was a development of over a few months.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:36.120]   So, uh, I, I keep looking everywhere, it has never happened before.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.240]   I don't know, um, how this could have happened.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:45.520]   But yeah, we will possibly have to recreate it, but, uh, at least we have all the cards
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.600]   already and everything is already lasered.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.120]   So it shouldn't take too long anymore.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:56.840]   I would guess, you know, within the next three weeks, we probably should have it done.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.160]   But yeah, sorry for the delay on that.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.160]   Okay.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.160]   All right.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.520]   So right now it's just, it's the same set of frequencies.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.520]   Um, okay.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.520]   That's great.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.800]   You know what, just before the, before our chat, everyone, I just wanted to share with
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:15.560]   you that Philip, what I were talking about, um, how to help you decide what would be the
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:18.440]   best frequency for you.
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.600]   The cards are just a representation of a frequency.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.200]   That's where the frequency is embedded in a card.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:27.280]   So it's, I, I'm using the words, uh, you know, as the same.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.280]   So which frequency based on what you're looking for in your life and what you're trying to
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.220]   address or solve?
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:38.280]   And so, um, if you click on any one of these, I just want to point out that you will see
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.280]   the description.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.180]   So that's where the descriptions live.
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:47.160]   Um, and then also to like, like I was telling, uh, telling you earlier, um, one of the things
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:53.560]   I do on my block is my blog is I also have, um, are actually like what I'm trying to do
[00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:57.660]   is like I've gotten here.
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:03.900]   If you guys are interested in, I post this onto if it, this is like basically a compilation
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.840]   of all of the different descriptions.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.200]   So if you want to look at it at a glance, this will hopefully eventually end up on the
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:15.120]   website, but I just wanted to share with everybody who's like looking for, um, you know, a frequency
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:19.640]   that, that for a specific thing that they might have, that they want to address.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.600]   And so the easy way to do it is, you know, you can basically click on each one of these
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:28.920]   or right now I do have a PDF that's a compilation of the descriptions so you can kind of see
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.120]   all of them at a glance.
[00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.660]   So that just to help you kind of just find out, because I do see a number of people come
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:38.100]   into the chat where, you know, they're like, I have this, what would be the best card,
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.700]   you know, slash frequency.
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:44.700]   So that's, there's two different ways to go about finding out what each one does.
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.740]   And so I just wanted to point that out.
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.380]   Um, and then fill up to, I mean, is, is, is there anything you can add to that?
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:56.940]   Like, you know, um, like for someone who's just kind of like has an issue, um, and they're
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.260]   looking for like, what's the best frequency for me?
[00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:04.760]   What would be your advice on trying to, you know, like match a frequency to something
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.820]   that somebody wants to work on?
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.820]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:13.060]   So obviously that is something that we can do an even better job in the future to help
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:19.700]   categorize the different frequency cards, because I understand it may be a little bit
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.860]   much effort to go through the list of all of these here.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:29.020]   But as of now, I would use either your list or if I go to the drop down and you just open
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.980]   that one.
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:37.620]   And then the disc, the, the names of the cards actually already tell quite a lot about what
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.620]   it is about.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:44.700]   Obviously, if you read DNA and self protector, you know, that's, that's something, you know,
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.460]   for you and has to do with a DNA in the cell.
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:51.580]   So if that already resonates with something that you're looking for, then you could go
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:56.220]   into the description of it and read through it and then really figure out is that the
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:00.940]   right one for me on the same with, you know, sleep and rest and inner peace, I think those
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:05.520]   are quite self explaining titles.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:11.380]   And yeah, then just read through it and figure out if you resonate with it.
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:18.140]   So I always like to ask people to feel inside, you know, do you resonate with this?
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.580]   Does this feel like the right card for you?
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:25.820]   And then usually it is the right card.
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:26.820]   Okay.
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:27.820]   Okay.
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:34.260]   And, you know, I just clicked on this is so the, the four for, to buy four now that's,
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.500]   that's special is still running, right?
[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.900]   According to this website, it appears so, yes.
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.900]   Okay.
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:42.900]   Yeah.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:43.900]   Because I was okay.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:49.820]   So, so right now, you know, this is the, the one right now that's the DNA frequency.
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:55.220]   And so if you, for one card, it's 145, but there's, there's been a, I guess, is this
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:59.060]   special going to last long because you can get four for five dollars, basically more
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.060]   than one.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.660]   So you get basically four for one.
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.260]   Well, I would say it's going to last at least for the next two weeks.
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:09.020]   And then we may take that down.
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:10.020]   Okay.
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.020]   All right.
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.020]   So that, yeah.
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.260]   So the, the four for one special is the sale.
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.060]   It's going to go for another couple of weeks.
[00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:20.480]   So is there anything else on sale because it's kind of like they're kind of, like, is
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.480]   there a sales page?
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:24.100]   If somebody wanted to say what's like, what's on special?
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.100]   I guess.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:29.780]   We'll have in the future, we'll have on the very top, there will be a bar with special
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:30.780]   offers.
[00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:31.780]   Okay.
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:36.420]   That's currently not up because, yeah, I think that's, that's the one offer here.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:44.180]   Then the water bottle is currently reduced from 129 to $99.
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:47.140]   And then it'll also be up for a while.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:53.460]   And then, yeah, there's just the offer for the travel block for the, for the existing
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.460]   queue block and the community block owners.
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.460]   Okay.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.460]   All right.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:03.700]   So, you know, I just wanted to say because we're, we're running short on time for today.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:07.260]   So we're going to just, you know, I mentioned in the chat group that we're going to do
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.740]   a Q&A and I've been collecting questions.
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:14.540]   So I think what Phillip and I are going to probably do is do that Q&A next week.
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:19.900]   And so, you know, so, and then we'll cover those kind of questions there.
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:25.780]   And so for today, we just wanted to share the new products and the new website.
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:30.780]   And of course, you know, the, the link now I noticed you've actually got the links now
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.380]   to the actual telegram chat group.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:39.260]   So for anyone who's new, it's never actually visited the chat group.
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.420]   And there's a link right now, I believe right there.
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.020]   No, not there.
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:46.500]   I saw a picture of a person holding a phone.
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:50.940]   I know it's in here somewhere where you can actually get to the, to the telegram.
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.740]   So, so that's the new website.
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:53.740]   That's the new products.
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.460]   I want to just thank everybody for listening in.
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.860]   And before I let you go, Phillip, we've got to just another five minutes before I know
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:00.860]   you got to run.
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:01.860]   But is there anything else?
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:02.860]   Okay.
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:06.060]   So, you know, because it's always exciting about what you're working on and or the, you
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.940]   know, or new studies that are coming out.
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:15.060]   So, as we stand as of today, the focus your mind frequency, you're expecting it to get
[00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.380]   out within two or three weeks, right?
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.060]   Is there anything else that you're working on that you might want to share now or you
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.980]   want to save that for a future discussion?
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:28.460]   Well, there's, you know, as a teaser, just so you guys know what's, what's coming, you
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:30.980]   have the latest information.
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:34.260]   So we're working on the quantum upgrade service.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:39.260]   That's taking a lot of my time and it's a lot of hard work.
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.060]   I think we'll be launching it.
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:50.060]   I think in the beginning of June with probably 20 to 30 test persons, not because we need
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.460]   to test the how it works.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:56.540]   That's already been proven and even tested in studies and all of that.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.540]   That's all working.
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:05.140]   We want the actual front end and back end to communicate and also have 20, 30 people
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:10.620]   run through it and have our customer service run through everything and will probably even
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:14.020]   announce that in the group because that will be a free test.
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:20.780]   So whoever wants to then participate, you know, will have probably up to 20 or 30 free
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:26.700]   spots for a few weeks and I don't want to say too much, but it's a very flexible offering
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:32.620]   and it's pretty cool, it's pretty unheard of and I'm pretty sure that people will love
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.620]   it.
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:39.100]   So we'll announce that and but Kay and I will probably have a video in regards to that so
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.140]   we can provide more details.
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:51.260]   And then the opt to today, we work very hard on the website and there's actually two studies
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.900]   that I want to mention.
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:59.180]   One is actually an animal study that we already did and I was already completed in the end
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:04.220]   of December and I think we never published it.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:08.580]   We never published it just because there was so many other things and I just realized
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:13.080]   last week while we had this study and we never published it and I think people that have
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.700]   pets are maybe really interested in that.
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:22.780]   So we're going to try to get that done over the next let's say also three weeks and then
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:31.220]   there is the study, the Darkfield Microscopy study, a double blind study that was done
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:39.420]   actually by the Basa Institute in Europe for this quantum upgrade service and it was an
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:46.020]   absolutely amazing study we're currently still going through the translations and everything
[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:52.020]   and we hopefully also should have that up and running in three weeks and then there will
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:44:00.780]   be an expanded study on top of that one that will happen over the next 30 to 45 days.
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:05.940]   And yes, I think those are the most most important updates for now.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:12.420]   That's amazing, I think for those of you who may not be familiar with what Phillips describing
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:21.140]   as a service but we're talking about using the Leleke quantum energy technology remotely
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:26.700]   right and that's going to be how that service is going to be designed so basically it's
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:34.060]   quantum healing of remotely and that's the idea of quantum entanglement.
[00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:42.440]   So it's just and you're already had it all tested and it's working and it's amazing.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.440]   It is amazing.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:51.020]   It still blows me away that I can use a block to help something or some animal or person
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:58.900]   from a hundred thousand miles away and it actually really works so that so those studies
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:02.460]   are going to be coming out when you launch the service right so people can actually read
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:10.700]   about how you're using a block and you put someone in there and then that person miles
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:15.180]   away, you can actually test them and look at their blood and is that kind of what that
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.180]   study is?
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.180]   Exactly.
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:24.340]   Yes, and it's mind boggling indeed.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:28.860]   It's so mind boggling that the head of the Bayes Institute had literally tears in his
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:34.620]   eyes when he left me the message about the results and what they just found out because
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:42.940]   you know it was over 200 kilometer distance right so really far away and it was double
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:48.420]   blind and the results were amazing and they were significant and they were in a hundred
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:54.980]   percent of the cases and it's just you know it's yeah it's just it's touching in a way
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:46:01.460]   you know that this is working and how it's working and so significantly so that is indeed
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:09.520]   great and yeah but it was a lot of hard work because the technology as is or as it was
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:14.140]   couldn't have been used for something like that only just for like one person you could
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:21.700]   do one person at a time and you can only do it at one certain quantum consciousness level
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:26.980]   now what we're doing is now it's it's so flexible now I'm actually giving more information away
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:34.740]   than I wanted to but you have levels from from 500 on the Hawkins scale up to 1200 on
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:42.060]   the Hawkins scale but 1,101,200 will only be available for people with a significant experience
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:46.500]   so meaning they must have had already an affinity block or something like that because those
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:53.180]   levels are so strong but even the other ones are great and there's flexibility and yes
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:58.540]   we will have a lot of different options that you can pick even up to the point where if
[00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:04.860]   someone has a business you can actually have that service for your business and now I actually
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:10.020]   want to you know give some information away that people will love everyone in the in the
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:15.660]   chat group will love this and we found this out through the work with with the quantum
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:21.500]   upgrade development and and now we actually tested it further and figured out it actually
[00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:30.380]   also works if you use your affinity block of any kind it could be an infinity block first
[00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:35.700]   generation or seventh generation it doesn't matter and also you can use the travel block
[00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:44.180]   for that if you put your name in there together with your birth date you exact birth date
[00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:50.260]   then everything around your birth date will be harmonized what does that mean usually
[00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:57.860]   we when we're born there's a lot of trauma that are happening on an energetic level because
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:04.740]   of this birth right which is traumatic in a way it's beautiful but it's also traumatic
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:11.140]   in a way because there's a lot of pain involved and things like that and yeah we we noticed
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:18.540]   that that this completely harmonizes it so you can just test that with yourself leave
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:25.660]   that piece of paper in there maybe for an hour it may already be done after 10 15 minutes
[00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:31.980]   already but I would suggest at this point an hour and see what it does it definitely
[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:37.780]   is it's pretty awesome and you can do that even for your friends also or your family
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:44.140]   members if if they like so this is I think a pretty cool thing and you don't need anything
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:49.780]   extra for that if you own infinity block already you can you can use it and should work with
[00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:54.660]   the quantum block too but I'm not a hundred percent certain that's the only one we haven't
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:49:00.980]   tested yet you know it's I'm just listening to you and I'm blown away so you're saying
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:07.780]   let me get this straight do I write my full birth name like middle first middle last name
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:14.340]   and the date of my birth and I can take that piece of paper and put it inside my my infinity
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:22.780]   or my travel block and then the quantum energy will then I guess I guess neutralizes the
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:27.340]   only word that's coming to my head but it's gonna it's basically gonna take away all the
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:34.260]   negative aspects or the negative whatever you know of of my birth yes it harmonizes your
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:40.620]   birth really harmonizes your birthday and and but if you if you if you have a birthday
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:48.740]   let's say April 21st please don't write it in this way of 4/21 or like the Germans would
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:50:00.620]   write it 21st 21.4 write it April and then you can do 20 the 2 1 21st but right right
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:07.980]   out the the month so that that is clear so you would write April then 21 and then comma
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:15.620]   you know 1974 or whichever the the birth year was and yeah again together with your real
[00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:23.860]   full name and that's that's the clear signal for that it's pretty awesome yeah I gotta
[00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:29.820]   ask you I mean have you guys thought about like other dates like like if I were to write
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:35.100]   my full name down on a date that I was I had a traumatic experience do you think that would
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:41.860]   work for that it's it's a possibility indeed it's something that we can test so thanks
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:50.980]   for actually raising that question so it you know I would say why not so I think it's
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:56.660]   it's likely even that it's that it's possible but we haven't tested that so let's let's
[00:50:56.660 --> 00:51:05.100]   be cautious but yeah it doesn't hurt trying that and we can we can look into that further
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:09.700]   that's amazing thank you for sharing that you know honestly this that's the power of
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:15.380]   the healer network I mean we've got some incredibly gifted people that are have talents beyond
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:23.220]   my description and and these your team is doing some amazing stuff I mean okay I can't
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:27.300]   say enough about it it's just that's amazing I'm gonna try that right after I hang up with
[00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:33.940]   you hey there's one more thing that I actually didn't even want to raise yet because this
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:40.840]   is still probably several months out but we've been working with someone who's been focused
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:53.500]   on trauma work also healer from Europe actually Austria and he has developed a pretty amazing
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:52:06.420]   method on how to little really is every traumatic experience in in about half an hour and sometimes
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:12.340]   it takes 45 minutes sometimes it takes up to an hour and but it's it's with full full
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:18.540]   resolution like there's literally there's nothing left of that and it's pretty amazing
[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:24.460]   and we've joined forces and figured out a way how to combine it with our technology
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:32.440]   in a way where it now can be done in the matter of just two to three minutes and yeah so we
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:38.260]   there's something that we're working on that's specifically just about trauma work and you
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:42.980]   know trauma that doesn't need to be one of those super tough traumas we have those but
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:49.860]   we have little ones as well we have tons of little one actually and it's we like to describe
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:56.280]   it as this backpack right so we all have this backpack and it gets heavier and heavier
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:53:02.340]   and heavier with all the kind of like quote unquote negative experiences or trauma does
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:08.920]   that we go through and you know as we become aware of all this and we're starting to connect
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:15.000]   more with ourselves it's sort of our job to you know lighten this backpack right because
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.120]   that's you know how we can really open up more and the more we can release of that backpack
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:26.760]   the better we feel ultimately right and so it's it's all about releasing that backpack
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:31.960]   and and there's going to be something that will come up with that is specifically focused
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:37.960]   on that and that's going to be really exciting to oh yeah I'm I'm looking forward to that
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:44.240]   some of us have more than a backpack we have like duffel bag roller bags and and you know
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:50.760]   the old-fashioned Louis Vuitton crate luggage all right well you know what I know we're
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:54.320]   out of time and you know thanks for sharing that everybody give it a try let's hear what
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:54:00.280]   you try it and come into the chat and let us know what happened but yeah thank you so
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:04.140]   much Phillip for your time this morning I love the look of the new website there's a lot
[00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:09.620]   more information we got new products it's all it's all great stuff so Phillip I will arrange
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:15.140]   a time to do the Q&A because and answer your questions in hopefully in a week or so and
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:20.900]   we'll get to that next and then in the meanwhile enjoy your products enjoy some of the new stuff
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:26.300]   and and this is amazing and give that birthday to try I'm gonna try other dates just to see
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:31.340]   you know but yeah I got me you got my tinker my tinker mind going now on that one but anyway
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:37.860]   thank you very much Phillip any parting words well thank you K for your time and yeah for
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:43.020]   helping to get this out here the information and thanks to everyone in the group I know
[00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:48.500]   I haven't been as active in the group as I would like to so yeah thanks to all of you
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:56.740]   and thanks also to K and to Emma and everyone helping in the group it's it's really joyful
[00:54:56.740 --> 00:55:02.460]   to see the group and still we have great vibes in there so that's that's a blessing and
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:07.700]   I'm looking forward to the future all right thank you very much you have a great day you
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:09.260]   too all right Allah
