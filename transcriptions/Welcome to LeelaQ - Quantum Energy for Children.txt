[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   Aloha, everyone, and welcome to another Tinker's Academy video.
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.060]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer.
[00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.760]   And this video is another installment in the video series.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.160]   Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech, or Quantum Upgrade.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.000]   Basically, it's a video FAQ series for people that are new to Layla Quantum Tech
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.840]   and or just existing customers who have general questions.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.680]   So we're trying to just kind of make videos to answer the questions because
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.880]   sometimes it's just easier to make a little video to give you all of the
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.880]   different, you know, information related to a particular question,
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.880]   as opposed to trying to, you know, answer it in a post on Telegram.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.580]   So this video is to respond to anyone who's interested in, you know,
[00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.280]   how, you know, I want to provide quantum energy to my child.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.880]   I've heard about all the great benefits.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.580]   And so, you know, what are the options and what are the best approaches towards,
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.580]   you know, bringing quantum energy into my child's life.
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.180]   So now as it relates to children, I do want to kind of just share that.
[00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.780]   You know, you really got two options.
[00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.980]   Now there's the quantum upgrade and then that is a quantum service that you
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.780]   subscribe to and it sends energy to whomever you choose yourself, your pet,
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.780]   your child.
[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.080]   And so you could set your child up for a U subscription and then and then
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.280]   have the benefits of quantum energy for your child.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.480]   And then I'll go into the detail here in a second.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.280]   Your other option is to provide your child with a wearable.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.480]   And so there's different wearables that they could wear.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.280]   Obviously there's issues with that, you know, depending on age.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.480]   But those are your two basic options here.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.780]   You can either send the energy to them so that they're always in this little
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.880]   protective quantum energy bubble or they can wear something on their person
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.680]   and be inside of a little quantum energy bubble.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.080]   So those are your two main choices.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.480]   The first one here I want to kind of focus it on is the quantum upgrade service.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.280]   Now, as I mentioned, it's a kind of based on the concept of quantum entanglement.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.680]   You enter in the information about your child into the subscription and then
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.380]   you'll basically set up, you know, having that energy.
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.880]   Like I said, that little bubble will surround them.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.280]   And the thing about it is that energy is going to be with them 24/7.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.480]   You can pause it at any time.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.680]   You can adjust the settings on terms of energy levels.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.880]   You can set timers day and night.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.680]   And so there's a lot of flexibility.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.480]   And literally it is the easiest thing.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.880]   If you have a child, the quantum upgrades subscription for you
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.880]   where they, the child would be the you would be the perfect thing
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.480]   because the most important thing, there's nothing to lose.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.680]   So depending on the age of your child, you know, little kids lose stuff constantly.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.180]   So, you know, you don't want to spend a hundred bucks, two hundred bucks,
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.180]   and then the kid loses it.
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.380]   Right.
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.280]   So so there's really that's the most brilliant part about the upgrade
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.080]   service is you can provide your child with this protective energy bubble
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.680]   and all the benefits that come from it without having to worry about
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.280]   anything that's going to get lost.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.980]   Again, it's 24/7 and the boosters.
[00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.780]   Now what I kind of want to comment on that is the boosters come in really,
[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.280]   really handy for any time where you want to just send a little bit more
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.180]   energy to your child and that could be where like if they're in sports
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.280]   and you want to basically kind of just give them energy boost where you could
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.180]   time it where you can give them that energy boost during that period of time.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.780]   My child is is an adult in grad school and I have her subscribe to quantum
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.280]   upgrade and she kind of just would give me a text and say,
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.880]   hey, I'm about to go take an exam and then I'll just go ahead and go
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.780]   into her settings for her.
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.980]   Now she's got completes.
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.580]   If you've got an older child that you trust, you know,
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.380]   being able to control stuff for themselves, that, you know,
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.580]   I've actually given her the set her up on a U subscription where she has
[00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.380]   control of all of her settings with her own password.
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.380]   She doesn't see my stuff.
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.780]   I don't mean, I do see her stuff because I'm the one, you know, paying for it,
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.180]   but she has access to all of her own settings and she could change the
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.080]   booster levels and all of those different features I mentioned,
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.380]   which is really handy, but you know, she's kind of busy and lazy.
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.480]   So she'll just text me and then so I'll just send her a boost of energy
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.480]   during when she's taking exams.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.080]   Just as one example, you know, again, if your child's in sports,
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.480]   you can boost them while they're in playoffs, you know, playing, you know,
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.080]   any one of the practices or actual games and that sort of thing.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.680]   So the boosters are nice because you can really just kind of just give them
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.080]   that extra energy above, you know, the baseline that that is provided by
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.080]   the service.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.180]   The other thing too, about the quantum upgrade service, there's an extra fee,
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.980]   but if you subscribe to the bundle of the frequencies,
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.780]   you have access to all of the laser frequencies except for maybe like four or
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.180]   five, you know, that are available on the device site.
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.580]   So it's the majority of the frequencies and you can send any kind of
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.280]   frequency on that list to them at any time of the day.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.380]   You have full control to turn it off, turn it off, you know, change it,
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.780]   you know, pause it, whatever.
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.680]   So it's really a great combination to give you an example of how I use
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.380]   frequencies with my daughter, you know, she's in grad school.
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.180]   And so she'll say, hey, I've got an exam, I'll kick off a booster for her
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.780]   and then I'll put on the focus frequency to help her with her cognitive,
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.280]   you know, capabilities, just helping her focus.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.780]   You know, that's what she really needs or she's, you know,
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.180]   doing something really, really kind of nerve-wracking.
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.280]   I'll send her like the inner piece frequency to help her calm, you know,
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.780]   keep her nerves calm, you know, all of those kinds of things.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.380]   But I can sit and control it and she can control it, but she, you know,
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.780]   it's easier for her to text me and I'll do it for her, you know, it is.
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.980]   And so, but the whole idea, though, is you can basically apply any,
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.180]   any one of the frequencies at any time, however you want.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.180]   So the quantum upgrade service, because it's so customizable and so simple.
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.380]   It literally is the number one recommendation.
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.380]   I would give to any parent for any, you know, any age child that you have.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.080]   It is really the best option.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.380]   And again, you know, you're going to get all of those benefits.
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.180]   If you've heard about the studies and you've heard about the results
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.880]   from the studies, all of those benefits come from exposure to quantum upgrade,
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.580]   which is the same as getting exposed to the devices themselves,
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.080]   which is the next option.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.280]   So if you've decided that, you know, you're really not going to,
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.080]   you don't really, you know, you don't want to try the subscription,
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.780]   which is fine.
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.780]   By the way, there is a free trial if you just want to give it a shot, right?
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.880]   But if you want to just go with the wearables, which is a one-time payment
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.680]   versus a subscription, which is monthly, I totally get it.
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.080]   Now, the wearables here, again, it's really age dependent.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.180]   So the one thing that I really want to stipulate is, you know, not that we have.
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.680]   And I've been one of the moderators and admins for the Telegram chat group,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.080]   which is a support groups for the two different devices and service.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.180]   And so in the four years that I've been moderating those channels,
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.780]   I've never had any instances where people have reported anything other
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.880]   than their kid lost it.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.180]   Usually it's if it's a capsule, they'll open it and they'll lose the spheres
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.180]   or they'll just flat out lose a card, lose the capsule itself.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.480]   But, you know, there's, but it is a choking hazard.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.580]   So, you know, I mean, so, you know, that's the thing.
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.380]   You know that their kid, they're going to lose it or if they got a capsule,
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.780]   they're going to open it and play with the little spheres in there.
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.180]   And so that's kind of the thing where, you know, if they're too young,
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.780]   then you've got an issue with how do I provide quantum upgrade?
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.180]   I'm sorry, quantum energy to this to the child,
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.680]   but not give them something they're going to lose.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.980]   But here are your choices.
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.180]   Okay, basically, you can get a quantum capsule and those come with frequencies.
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.180]   You can get a card like a quantum, like it's a metal business card.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.380]   And if they can carry that on their person or, you know, carry the capsule
[00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.580]   and their person, again, the bracelets as well.
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.580]   They're all wearables, you know, but the cards themselves, you can get a neutral one.
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.580]   That's just neutral energy and also you can get them in different frequencies.
[00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.980]   The bracelets are all neutral energy and they just like copper bracelets.
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.780]   But those are the things that, you know, if you want to just go with the wearable,
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:38.180]   those are your options there in terms of, you know, the quantum energy devices.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.980]   So you'd be cards, capsules and bracelets.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.380]   And then there's also clothing as well, which I'll get to that here in a second.
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.380]   But the next thing I do want to let you know that there's an option
[00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.280]   under the guise under the umbrella of devices.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.080]   And that's actually going out and getting a quantum block.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.180]   Now that's really, you know, that's the high end of the price point.
[00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.780]   If you want to, you know, bring this, these energy into your life and your family,
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.780]   it is the high end of the price point.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:07.980]   But the benefit of having a block is really, really high.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.880]   And, you know, because the whole idea about a block is you can literally create
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.780]   and customize your own quantum upgrade service.
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.280]   The only thing you can't do with a block is boost, you know, let that booster thing
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.580]   I was mentioning, but you can create your own wearables.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.180]   You can create your own frequencies.
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.380]   You can literally run a quantum upgrade for your child by simply putting
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.080]   your child's picture in a block.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.180]   And yes, it works, you know, I mean, if it's all been tested and it works.
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.780]   So it's this concept of quantum entanglement, but it's this amazing feature
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.880]   of the blocks where you can literally run your own quantum upgrade.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.380]   You put your child's picture in the block and they're going to get quantum energy.
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.180]   As long as that picture is in the block, it's getting sent to them.
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.380]   Again, you could add frequencies to that.
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.780]   You know, so you can send a picture of your child in a block and then you could
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:00.180]   put, you know, a frequency in there and the only the only drawback with doing
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.880]   that is that it's only one person at a time unless you want to entangle them.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.580]   Okay.
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.980]   Or, you know, and some siblings don't get along.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.380]   But yeah, that's a whole nother subject.
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:15.380]   But, you know, usually the recommendation is one person at a time in a block.
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.680]   But the whole idea here is you can do your own quantum upgrade thing with your
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.900]   child if you had a block.
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.880]   Again, you could create your own wearable.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.080]   So there's other things that the kid, you know, would wear.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.780]   You could charge it like belt buckles and, you know, they carry their keys with
[00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:35.180]   them or whatever they carry on them that you want them to wear.
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.280]   Then you could do that, you know, instead of putting a picture in the block.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.280]   If you have certain frequencies that Layla doesn't offer, like, let's say,
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.980]   you know, your child has a certain type of medicine that they might need to
[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.180]   take or they have allergies and, you know, you want to just, you know,
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.380]   basically send them some kind of a frequency or if you're someone that
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.280]   really understands, you know, homeopathic remedies and essential oils and
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.680]   those things and all of that, those positive vibrations for those from those
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.080]   kinds of things, you can create your own frequencies and you can then send them
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.980]   frequencies for whatever you want.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.280]   I've actually customized numerous frequencies for my daughter.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.880]   The primary one that I developed for her was, you know, she's in a really
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.980]   high stress environment, right?
[00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.580]   She's in grad school training to be a veterinarian and so high stress and
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.980]   she's working part-time at the hospital, the vet hospital.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:27.280]   So with all that stress, I had her, you know, I had last year, I had her meet
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.480]   with a friend of mine.
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.880]   That's a naturopathic physician.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.880]   They did this whole review on her and they came up with this list of supplements
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.680]   that, you know, and it has.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.180]   It's been a year and it's completely turned her health around.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.780]   She was getting sick like once a month just, you know, getting the rundowns
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.880]   fatigue, you know, because her immune system so beat up from the stress.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.780]   But the supplements that was recommended by the naturopath, we've been
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.380]   giving, you know, I've been giving those to her for a year now.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.780]   And so she's 180, you know, in terms of her health.
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.180]   And so it's been really good.
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.380]   So part of that, though, was not just giving her the physical supplements, but
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.580]   I made a custom frequency of those supplements and I put that and I put
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.180]   that through using a block.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.580]   I put that into some silver jewelry that she wears.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.280]   And one of the things about, you know, the Layla Quantum Tech capsules is
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.080]   their brass.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.880]   She's a girl.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.480]   And so my daughter was like, you know, that's kind of, you know, manly.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.080]   That's too masculine and she wanted something pretty.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.980]   So I went and made her custom jewelry.
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.380]   And so, you know, I actually gave her a custom silver pendant instead
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.680]   of a brass pendant, turned that into a charged capsule for her.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.380]   But then what she's really wearing with the vitamin and mineral
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.580]   frequencies that that were, you know, prescribed for her, those
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:43.180]   frequencies have been embedded in a ring and also a silver bracelet that
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.380]   I created for her as a wearable so that she's always got that with her.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.780]   And then on top of that, I've got the quantum upgrade so that I could be
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.280]   sending, you know, those focused frequencies and you name it, right?
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.280]   So I kind of got her, you know, from two different angles, just trying to
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.580]   keep her pumped up with energy and frequencies to support her, you know,
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.180]   her biology and also her bio field as she's going through a really
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.780]   stressful period of her life.
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.380]   The other great thing about blocks and I just can't stipulate this
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.380]   enough is the idea you can charge all of the food and water that you feed
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:14.880]   your child.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.380]   And so, you know, this quantum energy while you, while it's awesome to be
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.780]   in the, in the field of it and experiencing those benefits from it.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:27.180]   It's also one leg up if you can just start literally charging your food
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:31.680]   and water and imparting that life force energy into everything they ingest.
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.780]   And it also neutralizes really negative stuff that's in the food.
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.080]   So it's really a great thing to be able to do is to charge food and water.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.880]   And lastly, if you go on our telegram chat group, people post pictures of
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.480]   them doing stuff with their blocks and stuff all the time.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.180]   And so I pulled this right out of the telegram chat group for the quantum
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.980]   power group and this is literally somebody charging the kid.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.380]   So you can charge your kid, you know, so if you want to just, you know, do
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.780]   things with children, you can do all the things I've just mentioned on top
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.580]   of that, you can put them in the block if they fit.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.180]   But here, this little girl fit in the block and their parents are charging
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.780]   her up with pure quantum energy in this life force, wonderful energy
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.780]   that these devices put out.
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.080]   Now the last one I did want to mention again, and I said earlier was that
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.180]   there's EMF clothing.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:23.180]   And so one of the, you know, I'm just somebody who I've been deeply
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.880]   involved in EMF mitigation for a couple of decades now.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.280]   And because I just, you know, because I used to work in a data center
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.780]   and I had a lot of issues and a lot of sensitivities.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.380]   I lived in a condominium building surrounded by other buildings.
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:42.580]   And at one point, a neighboring building decided to lease out their
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.280]   roof and turn it into a cell phone tower.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.180]   And it literally was across the way, you know, this big, this park.
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.980]   And it was a building on the other side of the park and it became a cell
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.880]   phone tower, which was horrible.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.580]   And I, you know, I got meters and I could, I could see that it was
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:58.180]   really bad.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.580]   So I've been really involved in EMF and one of the things I just, I just
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.980]   can't stress enough to parents is the understanding that, you know, we're
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.380]   under this assault by EMF, you know, the electro smog 24/7.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.980]   But the thing about children is that while we as adults, you know, we're
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.080]   just inundated with it.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.380]   It causes all this biological stress on us.
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.380]   It does the same to your kids, but it's even worse because your kids are
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.580]   growing, especially at night.
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.580]   I mean, we all go to sleep.
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.180]   That's when our bodies regenerate.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.580]   That's when we, that's when we repair ourselves.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.480]   That's how we work biologically.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.580]   But, but mostly though, if you, if you read the literature on it, children do
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.180]   most of their growing at night while they're regenerating and repairing,
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.280]   you know, the cellular repair.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.780]   So, you know, it's so important to protect your kids even more so
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.680]   than protecting adults from the, from the onslaught of all this EMF
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.980]   from cell phone towers, from Wi-Fi routers, from satellites.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.080]   And it's just all over.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.180]   We can't get away from it.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.580]   So, one of the things I do want to impress upon you guys that if you're
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:03.080]   interested and you're looking to, you know, improve your child's health is to
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.280]   really look at and how you can help them with, you know, with the wearables,
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.880]   with the upgrade, but also consider EMF clothing because it's just one more
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.080]   thing you can do to protect your child and to help them.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.380]   And so that's why I'm bringing this up.
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.080]   So I just want to point out that Layla Quantum Tech on the device site and
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.380]   all the links to the different websites will be in the video description on the
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.080]   device site now they sell beanies.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.680]   So they sell beanies for babies.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.080]   They sell regular beanies, which are kind of, you know, for adults,
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.180]   but it will fit kids that also the baseball caps they sell.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.880]   Then these are all charged EMF clothing.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.380]   So it's EMF clothing when what that means is there's metal threads woven
[00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:45.980]   into the material of the of the item, which gives it a protective physical
[00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.580]   shield of EMF signals and then they add a quantum charge to it.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:54.780]   So it's a quantum charged EMF clothing and that quantum charge is held by
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.780]   that metal, those metal threads.
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.780]   And because it's basically emanating quantum energy, not only are you
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.780]   getting a physical shield from the actual radiation, but you're getting
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.380]   this positive influence on your biology in terms of mitigating the actual
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.380]   cell at the cellular level, you're mitigating the effects of the EMF
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.680]   internally with your biology.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.580]   So it's like it's, it's, it's even better than just wearing EMF clothing.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.680]   That's my point.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.380]   So again, there's beanies, there's caps.
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.380]   There's underwear, but they only have for men's right now.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.180]   There are no children underwear and there's no women underwear.
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.480]   So I, but there's a, you can do something about that.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.680]   There's T-shirts, right?
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.980]   So there's no children's T-shirts.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.280]   Unfortunately, obviously though, if you got an older child in middle school
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.480]   or above, they've got the men and women's T-shirts, which in the small
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.780]   size, usually will fit kids.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.580]   And then there's also jackets right now.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.380]   There's a jacket.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.980]   It's a, it's basically EMF, you know, material that's made into a jacket.
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.280]   There's a new jacket about to come out.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.880]   That's even better than the old one.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.580]   That's, that's, they're letting it go run out of stock.
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.380]   But the idea here is you can also get them a jacket, you know, for winter time.
[00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:06.080]   And then that'll basically, you know, protect them from the radiation and also
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:06.980]   help their biology.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.580]   And then the other thing though, if you do have, and that's just what they sell,
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:10.780]   right?
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.180]   So you can get wearables, which is in the form of EMF clothing for your
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:15.780]   children.
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.480]   But one more thing though, if you did decide to get a block, you can customize
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.580]   your own EMF clothing.
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:24.180]   So you're not just limited to what Leila Quantum Tech has available.
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:29.380]   So then at that point, if you have a block, then you can then go out and buy,
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:34.280]   you know, children's EMF clothing, their size, or even like, you know,
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:40.280]   I would highly recommend an EMF blanket so that your kid has a blanket,
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.080]   you know, an EMF radiation, you know, shield while they're sleeping.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.880]   You know, that's, that's one of the no brainers right there.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.280]   But you could take all of those.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.480]   You could buy that from anywhere.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.580]   I'll put links in the, in the description below on just on some sites where you
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.280]   can kind of take a look at what's available.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.380]   But the idea here is that you can get EMF clothing.
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.280]   You can customize it by charging it.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.680]   You can also can charge it and put a frequency in it.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.180]   But you can get anything that they sell for kids.
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.980]   You're not just limited to what Leila sells.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.680]   If you have a block, you can do all this yourself.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.780]   And so using a block is probably, like I said, it's the, it's the high end of the price
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:18.280]   point, but it's got the most versatility and the most ability to customize.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.080]   And so that's my recommendation for you parents out there that want to bring
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.380]   that quantum energy into your child's life, protect them from EMF, give them
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.980]   that life force energy and kind of just, you know, basically just, you know,
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.980]   really, really, you know, amp them up and protect them with this, with this energy.
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.380]   Okay.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.180]   So that's it.
