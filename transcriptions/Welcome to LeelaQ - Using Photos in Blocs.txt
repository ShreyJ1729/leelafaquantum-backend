[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.080]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer.
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.160]   And this video is another installment in the video series.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.280]   Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.040]   and Quantum Upgrade.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.960]   This is a video FAQ answering a lot of the frequently asked
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.680]   questions that pop up in the Telegram support groups
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.960]   for both services.
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.640]   Now this particular video, we're going
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.920]   to be talking about using photos in blocks.
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.680]   And what do I mean by that?
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.160]   Is essentially putting a photo in a block, one of those quantum
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.160]   blocks, there's several different versions.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.920]   Is essentially the same thing as the quantum upgrade service.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.360]   Utilizing the concept of quantum entanglement,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.960]   you can take energy and frequency and using a block,
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.120]   you can send it to the target object, person,
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.240]   place, or thing in the photo.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.720]   Just like the quantum upgrade service
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.400]   will collect your information and send you frequencies
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.000]   and energy to the people, place, or whatever, right?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.320]   And so that's the general idea, if you want to learn more
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.600]   about quantum entanglement, hold another video series.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.200]   But that's the idea is you can use a photo
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.760]   and you can do your own little quantum upgrade service
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.000]   and you can send energy.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   OK, that's the very first thing you could do
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.880]   is you can send that positive energy to whomever
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.160]   and whatever is in the photo.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.000]   OK, that's the first thing you could do.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.440]   The second thing you could do, like I said,
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.120]   is you can send frequency through the block
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.120]   to that person, place, or thing.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.920]   And also, you can manifest intention for that person,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.840]   place, or thing by using photos.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.160]   And that's really the idea here is by--
[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.720]   the photo is essentially from a consciousness standpoint.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.000]   It establishes in the field where you want it to go.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.240]   And so if you put a photo in that block,
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.720]   then that's where it's going to go.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.280]   Energy, frequency, or intentions.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.960]   OK, you can manifest intentions for whatever's
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.240]   in that photograph.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.400]   So that's what it can do.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.440]   So you're basically running your own little quantum
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.840]   upgrade service using a block and photos.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.840]   But I want to clarify something that's important.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.280]   No, there's a couple of things you can't do.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.160]   So unlike the quantum upgrade service,
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160]   there's no way to boost the energy.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.880]   OK, so there's-- in the quantum upgrade service,
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.560]   you can actually amp up the energy.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.040]   Like you have there's a baseline energy level
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.480]   that you've got running during the day and during the night,
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.360]   depending on your timing set, your time settings.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.400]   However, in the quantum upgrade service,
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.880]   you can literally up the dial and turn up the volume
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.240]   on the level of energy that's called a boost.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.440]   And you can boost energy.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.680]   Well, there's no way to do that.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.280]   The block is a set amount of energy.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.200]   And that's going to be the set baseline.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.560]   And you cannot increase the amount of energy.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.360]   So that's where quantum upgrade has a little perk
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.000]   in terms of being able to boost energy.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.120]   But the blocks, you can't boost energy.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.160]   Now, when you're using a block with a photo,
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.560]   you cannot charge anything in the photo.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.960]   OK, so you can send energy to it.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.880]   But if you wanted to charge, let's say, food,
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.720]   you need to put the food in the block.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.320]   You can't take a picture of the food.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.000]   And so for those of you who have been around for quite a while,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.320]   there has been a little confusion on that.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.600]   So in the idea of like, hey, I want to charge my car,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.560]   how do I charge it?
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.120]   Well, the answer used to be we'll just
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.680]   put the photo of the car in there.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.280]   But I clarified with Philip von Holzendorf,
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.800]   the owner operator of Leila Quantum Tech, about that.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.640]   And he was basically clarified it that, no, you don't actually
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.320]   charge what's in the photo.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.360]   You send energy to it.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.560]   And when you take the photo out, the energy lingers for a little
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.080]   bit and then goes away.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.280]   So the idea of sending energy and charging stuff
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.000]   are two separate things.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.760]   So if you want to charge it, you literally
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.840]   have to physically put it between the plates.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.560]   However, you can take a photo of, let's say, your car,
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.480]   put it in the block.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.800]   Let's say you're going on a long trip
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.520]   and you're not taking your block with you.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.480]   You could easily take the photo of the car,
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.720]   put it in the block, and then go on your trip.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.560]   And the whole time, your car will
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.400]   be receiving that quantum energy because of the photo.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.360]   But it won't charge the car or charge the food
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.120]   or whatever you're charging.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.880]   The other thing that you cannot do with photos
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.080]   is copy frequency.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.160]   So I did clarify with Philip because this question came up
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.120]   in one of my other groups about, can I take a picture of,
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.400]   let's say, a supplement and copy that to a card or jewelry
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.120]   or whatever, and take the frequency of an item
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.000]   from a picture of the item.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.080]   And I clarified that with Philip.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.600]   And the bottom line is, check with Roman Hofner,
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.240]   who's the Wonder King on frequencies.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.240]   And basically, he said, you can't do it.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.760]   Don't do it because there's other stuff in the photo
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.680]   and there's so much room for error
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.880]   that the chance that you'll actually
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.560]   get the actual molecular frequency of the substance
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.440]   is remote and it just won't work.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.320]   So you cannot put a photo of something
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.040]   and then expect to be able to take the frequency of that
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.360]   and then copy that to something else.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.080]   And then it goes the other way is round.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.080]   You cannot take a frequency, put it in your block,
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.440]   and let's say I want to put the frequency of, let's say,
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.040]   vitamins, and I want to put that into a capsule.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.720]   Well, I can't take the vitamins and then
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.400]   a picture of the capsule.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.680]   I can't go backwards either.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.280]   So I can't copy from a photo from a photo of something
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.560]   and I can't copy to something in a photo.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.880]   So there's no copying frequencies involved.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.000]   There's no charging stuff involved and there's no boost.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.120]   So when you're using photos, you're
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.000]   primarily just sending energy and/or sending frequency
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.320]   and/or manifesting intentions.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.840]   So the other properties of a block
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.320]   do not apply with stuff in photos.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.120]   Now, the idea here on the recommended guidelines
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.520]   on how to proceed doing this, I'm about--
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.840]   I'm going to play you a clip from the part two
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.640]   of the block tutorials where Philip and I kind of dialogue
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.240]   about what his recommended guidelines are.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.000]   So I'm going to go ahead and play that for you.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.560]   So for those of you folks who have listened to it before,
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.960]   you can just skip right over it and then keep going on
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.880]   with the rest of the presentation because I've
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.640]   got other information I'd like to share on top of that.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.000]   That was recorded like, I don't know, two, three years ago.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.320]   But here's-- I'm going to go ahead and play you a clip where
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.400]   Philip and I are discussing the recommended guidelines
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.040]   for using the photos in blocks.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.400]   And it highlighted is just one person at a time.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.240]   It has to be recognizable.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.760]   And Philip talks about what has to be in that picture.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.120]   And also what's really interesting
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.280]   is Philip talks in that tutorial.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.880]   He talked about a case where putting a picture of a younger
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.320]   you in there because one of the things about the quantum
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.040]   field that it operates independent of time.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.840]   So there was a case--
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.160]   multiple cases of people putting pictures
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.440]   of younger versions of them in there and then
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.800]   being able to send through time sending frequencies
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.960]   and energy.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.440]   So he talks about that.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.320]   So let me go ahead and play that for you.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.040]   And the one thing that we didn't talk about in the tutorial
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.760]   was the idea of permissions.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.720]   So that's one thing I do want to kind of comment about that
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.080]   is when you are trying to help someone, the recommendation
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.160]   for-- and we put a photo of them and you send them intention.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.240]   You're trying to manifest an intention for someone
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.080]   like get well, that sort of thing.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.600]   Then the idea here is on the concept of permission
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.240]   is that you want to obtain their permission.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.080]   You want them to be part of that healing process.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.680]   And the more that they're part of that,
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.120]   the more that they accept it, the better your results
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.440]   are really going to be.
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.480]   And also, too, if they don't accept it,
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.800]   then it's not going to work at all because their consciousness
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.280]   will overwrite whatever you're trying to do.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.400]   So it's always really important that you get a person's
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:49.880]   permission.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.440]   Now, obviously, you cannot get a permission from a dog
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.400]   or cat or a horse, that sort of thing.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.480]   So there's nothing wrong with trying
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.120]   when you can't get the permission of somebody
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.000]   or they could be in a coma or something.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.920]   Or they can't speak.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.480]   So there's nothing wrong with trying.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.760]   But if you want the best results, get permission.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.000]   So let me go ahead and play that clip from the tutorial.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.200]   And then you'll get it straight from Philip in terms
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.160]   of what the recommended guidelines are.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.000]   So here we go.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.280]   So now the other question, though,
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.520]   is about more than one person in a photo.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.760]   So can you talk about that?
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.520]   Is it something that people should avoid?
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.960]   What's the worst thing that could happen?
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.680]   That sort of thing, like two people in the same block
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.760]   at the same time, or a person holding their pet?
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.000]   Or how it is, or people standing in and out?
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.440]   I mean, how important is it to not have any other living
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.360]   beings in the photo when you're trying to use a photo
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.560]   to send quantum energy to that person?
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.000]   It is important because you don't
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.880]   want to commingle these energies.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.280]   And that is exactly what is happening
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.280]   if you put two people or an animal and a person in there
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.360]   at the same time.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.120]   There are exceptions.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:13.560]   So if a husband and wife, for example, if they both agree,
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.760]   they can absolutely go in together
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:20.280]   because then even certain topics and stories
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.200]   in between the two, and maybe issues,
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.920]   underlying issues, maybe looked at and possibly
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.680]   even transformed, right?
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.760]   So those are certain things that can happen.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.960]   They can have a positive effect.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.120]   Possibly, right?
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.440]   And then that's OK.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.800]   And with the family, even if you have two kids,
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.520]   husband and wife, and they're all pretty much in agreement,
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.640]   then that is also a possibility because they're
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.160]   already so close, and they've all agreed.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:02.160]   But other than that, we recommend to never do that.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.120]   OK, good point.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.640]   OK, so unless you want to have a dog
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.440]   and you want to have suddenly an even deeper connection
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.760]   with a dog in a way, you could try what you did accidentally
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.680]   at some point where you had your dogs there in there
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.840]   with your photo.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.360]   And hey, why not?
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.680]   But in general, we don't recommend do that.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.240]   Yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.360]   because when you live with someone,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.840]   you're already connected to them because your biofield
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.400]   extends out about six feet.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.560]   So you're already co-mingling energy, right?
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.960]   And your frequency in theirs and you're always close to them.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.920]   Yes, and then you're--
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.360]   Yeah, whether you live with them.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.080]   There are services out there where
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.120]   energies are indeed co-mingled on a level that
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:58.760]   is unheard of and it's almost ridiculous, frankly.
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:04.000]   Because if you end up having 50, 60 different people,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.720]   animals, objects, all in at the same time
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.880]   and you're literally putting them in one energetic soup
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:16.160]   and steering them the whole time, it is crazy.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.920]   On an energetic level, that is an absolute no-go.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.760]   It is terrible.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.080]   It is not helpful at all.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.760]   It is something that should never be done.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.560]   We've actually worked since probably four months
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.560]   to figure out that problem and we've solved it, frankly.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.120]   So there's going to be more coming out in regards
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.080]   to that in the next couple of months.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.400]   But yeah, so just be mindful of that.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.480]   You just want to have one living being in there
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.200]   that you know of.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.120]   And if you want to be in there with your wife
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.560]   or spouse together, just ask her.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.160]   OK, so important, so best practices, a picture
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:00.040]   on a photo paper, one person at a time.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.720]   Now, would it be, now, the picture
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.000]   that we got questions about, OK, what kind of a picture?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.080]   Does it need to be their full body
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.960]   or could it be like their upper body and their face?
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.400]   You know, it wouldn't be a body part.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.520]   Like, let's say my sister heard her knee
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.440]   and she took a picture of her knee.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.200]   You know, would I need a picture of her instead of her knee
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.320]   or could I put that picture of her knee and use that?
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.760]   Yep, so first of all, I think any paper is fine, by the way.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.080]   So you need to just use regular printing paper.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.920]   That's what I do.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.160]   If you're more concerned about that,
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.680]   you can certainly take photo paper,
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.800]   but it's from my perspective, not necessary.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.160]   And if you want to, you know, give yourself a nice charge
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.320]   or someone else, then try to have a full body picture
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.800]   or as much of the body is on the picture,
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.320]   that's what I would recommend.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.640]   Now, the situation I had yesterday
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.160]   with this heavy migraine and neck pain,
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.600]   which I usually never have.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.240]   It was very unusual because we've tested that before.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.960]   It's this knee thing that you just recommended.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.880]   And that's how I did it also.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.920]   I just took a picture of that part and not my whole body.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.600]   And so the energy focused on that.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.040]   And the same with the knees.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.840]   So if you hurt your knee and that's all you want to work on,
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.960]   then that's totally enough.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.720]   You just need a picture of that knee
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.280]   if you can't do it, you know, physically.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.800]   Okay, 'cause that was the other question too.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.240]   It was like somebody asked if they could put a picture
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.280]   of a person that was like from behind, you know?
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.120]   And I wasn't sure.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.520]   I'm like, how would the world, how would the universe know
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.400]   that that's that person if you can't see their face?
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.960]   But you're saying that, you know, that's like, that's fine.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.120]   You know, that is that person.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.040]   So it doesn't need to be their face.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.400]   A full body's better, but a part can be fine,
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.360]   which is either, you know, a picture of them walking away
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.480]   from you or a picture of a part of them.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.920]   But you know, the whole idea is that's fine.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.840]   And of course, putting in an intention to help them heal.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.120]   And I think that's what drives the whole process anyway, right?
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.200]   - That is true.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.240]   However, like when I want to really charge my whole system,
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.800]   I would personally, that's what my intentions say,
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.400]   take a picture from the front where the eyes are on as well.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.240]   - Yeah.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.320]   - I'm not sure why that is, but I do feel that if you.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.320]   - Okay.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.160]   - Yeah.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.040]   That may have a greater effect for the overall system.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.800]   If you just want to charge you back,
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.760]   of course, just take a picture of your back.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.120]   No need at all for the eyes of the face.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.520]   - So optimal, get a picture of the person
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.160]   with their facing you.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.000]   That's optimal.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.840]   That's okay.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.800]   And then lastly was the question about putting a picture,
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.200]   does it have to be a recent picture?
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.280]   And I know that we have that really interesting testimonial
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.200]   for one of our members who worked to heal,
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.760]   I believe their child through trauma,
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.200]   and they put their child, a picture of their child
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.760]   at different ages.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.680]   You know, they were an adult at this point,
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.960]   but they put a picture of their child at a younger age,
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.760]   then you know, a little older, a little older,
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.360]   you know, how that has.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.560]   And that at each stage, right,
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.000]   they were helping send energy to that child of,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.200]   you know, that person of them at that time, you know,
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.040]   kind of thing.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.360]   And it seemed to have worked, you know,
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.720]   it seemed to have helped their adult child
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.440]   overcome childhood traumas.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.560]   And so that kind of begs to the question of is,
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.680]   you know, is it a picture of me now,
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.240]   or is it a picture of me 20 years ago?
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.240]   Does it matter?
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.720]   Or how much do you know about that?
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.880]   I mean, is it all experimental?
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.520]   - Yes, it's great questions.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.920]   And we know quite a bit about it
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.280]   because we've heard multiple reports
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.760]   and then also did some testing on our own.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:50.320]   So if you wanna charge yourself or help someone today
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.480]   with something that's going on now,
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.040]   then always take a most recent picture.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.920]   And you know, this doesn't, you know,
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.160]   you don't have to like take a new picture every day, right?
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.400]   That's not what that means.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.520]   You can still use a picture of it's two, three weeks old,
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:13.520]   but however, the more current, the better for sure.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:19.720]   And, you know, if I heard myself today, let's say now,
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.720]   and then in our, I wanna charge myself fully
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.320]   and I wanna have all this included in an optimal way,
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.840]   I would take a new picture, frankly.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.520]   That's what I would do, okay?
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:37.520]   But we have found out that indeed childhood trauma time
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.640]   and, you know, other blockages and experiences
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.640]   can be eased, harmonized and transformed even
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:54.400]   by putting in pictures of the child at the time.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:00.000]   Let's say between the ages of four and six,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.600]   certain difficult things happened
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.460]   because maybe the parents died.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:07.880]   Something else happened, got into an accident
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.840]   when it was six, like all that in just two years.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.120]   Then you would find pictures of the four-year-old,
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.480]   the five-year-old, the six-year-old
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.200]   and work your way through from the four-year-old
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.440]   to the six-year-old, put those pictures in.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.240]   And then things that happened at the time
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.200]   will see, you know, I almost said healing.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.640]   We don't wanna say healing, right?
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:35.000]   But it would say it would see a transformation
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.720]   and an harmonization of what had happened,
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.720]   a release of the trauma, that's what has been shown
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.560]   in multiple tests, so.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.280]   - That's amazing.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.120]   You know, that really--
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.240]   - So now, if none of it was myself,
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.040]   I actually also just tested on myself and it's interesting.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:57.280]   It's a very interesting thing to do.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.160]   I just found an old, you know,
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.600]   my mother had made a book at some point
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.560]   with the picture throughout my life until a certain age.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.320]   And I just took those pictures out, put them in.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.920]   And it's very, very interesting
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.960]   because you're not really charged today.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.840]   You still feel it and it's almost as if,
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.320]   you know, if you envision a rainbow
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.840]   with so many different layers and colors,
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.120]   it says if one of those layers is being charged
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.880]   and you feel that is being charged,
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.600]   there's something going on,
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.280]   but it's not your whole self, if that makes sense.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.880]   - No, I totally get it.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.880]   If for anyone who understands German to medicine
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.040]   or the concept of emotions getting trapped in your body,
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:44.280]   you know, biologically, to release those emotions,
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.480]   you need to inject energy into your system
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.760]   because they're trapped in you, emotions are energy.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.080]   And they're trapped in you, obviously.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.280]   And so you carry around all that baggage.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.160]   So you're saying that quantum energy
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.360]   has the capability of reaching that, you know,
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.880]   those blockages where those emotions are trapped.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.720]   And the link is a picture of you when that moment happened.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.160]   It's not like time travel, but it's more like,
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.880]   you are here now, but you're carrying all this stuff.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.280]   And the key to that is to reach out to that moment,
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.840]   that emotion got locked inside of you
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.080]   and to get that key is a picture of you as a child.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.800]   Or a picture of you, let's say 20 years ago,
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.600]   horrible divorce, you know, and you wanna get over it now,
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.520]   I get a picture of you back then.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.000]   So for folks that are suffering PTSD,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.680]   get a picture of the moment that, you know,
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.400]   of that timeframe that you were going through that event,
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.920]   put that picture in the block, put in intention and seek healing.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.240]   I think that's, that is amazing.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.040]   And you've actually, we've had more than one person
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.480]   than you're saying.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.360]   - Yes, there are multiple people actually.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.520]   And there are several people that are not even in the group
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.040]   that have reported that and have tested that.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.360]   And it's really quite interesting.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.400]   I mean, the concept is really not difficult to understand
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.160]   if you understand how that works
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.400]   and what you just explained is very, very helpful.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.400]   You know, the time and distance, first of all,
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.640]   doesn't really matter in that concentrated quantum field.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.520]   And indeed, it's about something, you know,
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.920]   you can solve stuff from the past in the now, right?
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.920]   You know, whether you do that with therapies, right?
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.640]   And you talk about stuff in the now
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.600]   about stuff that happened 20 years ago,
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.120]   and then you're kind of like at some point getting over that
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.360]   or you're doing a healing work with a shaman, you know,
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:39.360]   or using this type of energy to help with that.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.320]   Yeah, it's absolutely possible.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.040]   - Okay, thank you for sharing that.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:45.880]   Okay, great.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.960]   So that was out of the tutorial.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.880]   Now I just want to add a couple of things
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.840]   that I just want to emphasize.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   Now there's a Leila Q FAQ that is, you know, on the website.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.160]   And I kind of just want to highlight a couple of things
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.840]   in terms of the answer to, you know,
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.960]   how do I use a photo and a block?
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.400]   I just want to highlight a couple of things
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.720]   and it's kind of iterated because it is really important.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.840]   Is that the first thing to know is you need to follow
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.000]   your own intuition and your inner voice.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.920]   You know, just kind of, that's how this works.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.760]   Everyone is always asking, you know,
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.240]   how long should I leave a photo in?
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.840]   And my answer is always follow your intuition
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:22.320]   because there's no, you know, there's no guideline for this
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.880]   because it's quantum.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.160]   And so the whole idea is quantum is, you know,
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.680]   driven by consciousness.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.600]   And so really it's just, you know,
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:31.640]   when you want to use, you want to send frequency
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.400]   to someone to help them or you want to manifest energy
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.480]   in our intention, then just follow your intuition
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.120]   on what you feel would be the right amount of time
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.840]   to put that person in the block with, you know,
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.480]   the photo of them with whatever you're putting in there
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.320]   with them.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.160]   So just follow that.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.840]   And then just kind of just, you know, see.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.000]   However, there's one caveat though,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.760]   is that if somebody, it does matter how healthy
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.920]   or how conscious someone is that you put in there,
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.840]   you know, talking about pictures.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.320]   And so what that really stipulates is that
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.360]   if someone's really, really chronically ill
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.360]   and you're sending them all this quantum energy,
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.760]   you really want to keep track of what happens, you know?
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.960]   Like if it does interrupt their sleep, it does,
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.520]   it may, you know, 'cause all of this has been tested
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.080]   scientifically that this works.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.800]   I mean, there's, they've actually proven
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.920]   quantum up, you know, quantum entanglement works.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.640]   The frequency, the energy actually does get delivered
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.760]   to the target item in the photo.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.840]   So, you know, that's what the studies are.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.720]   If you go on quantum upgrade and you look at the science
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.200]   studies, it's real, it's really going to happen.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.520]   So if the person's chronically ill, right,
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.520]   or in a weakened state, it might be a little bit too much
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.360]   for them.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.320]   It might kick off like a detox reaction.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.880]   So you want to be really careful about the, you know,
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.720]   want to be conscious of the person's health
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.200]   and their condition.
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.960]   And then if you're going to try to help them
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.240]   and, or the dog cat, whatever, just really pay attention to,
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.080]   okay, I'm going to put you in the block for a few minutes
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.400]   and, you know, and see how that goes and see how you feel.
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.640]   But then just kind of work with them,
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.560]   follow your, you know, your intuition on that,
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.360]   but just go low and slow in the beginning with people
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.680]   that are having an animal center in chronic illness
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.000]   or, you know, that sort of thing.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.520]   The other thing too that it does, whether, you know,
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.760]   it does make a difference between whether it's night or day
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.320]   or morning or evening, you know, one of the things
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.960]   you may not want to do to someone who's sensitive to energy
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.040]   is send them energy at night.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.520]   So, you know, kind of keep it, you know, keep in mind too
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.520]   that the time of day, that person might be trying to sleep,
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.360]   you know, that sort of thing.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.840]   So keep in mind that those are the three things
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.320]   from the FAQ that I do want to bring up and kind of just,
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.160]   you know, make sure you guys are aware that when you're using
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.840]   photos and blocks, it's a real thing and you're really doing
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.160]   something and something's really going to happen.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.320]   And so you want to kind of be just conscious of, you know,
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.920]   of these three things, okay?
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.880]   Now the recommended durations for people, pets and plants,
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.400]   PPP, that's straight from the tutorial that we recorded,
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.040]   is depending on your block, you know,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.560]   this is for people, pets and plants.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.720]   So if they're brand new, let's say I'm just gonna, you know,
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.560]   most people have an infinity block to have an older one,
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.040]   but the older infinity block and also for all other stronger
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.120]   blocks going forward.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:11.160]   So for the infinity block and for the grand block
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.560]   and the new infinity block and the boosted infinity block,
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.960]   then the idea here is if somebody is brand new
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.760]   to quantum energy, then just go, like I said, slow and low.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.760]   So Phillips recommendation was four to six minutes.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.440]   You see how it goes, if they've, if they're experienced
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.640]   with quantum energy, put them in there for 10 minutes.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.320]   And then he kind of set a maximum for 10 minutes.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.440]   And so that's kind of what the recommendation is from Leila.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.520]   And I just want to say from personal experience,
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.880]   like I have put myself, my dogs, people.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.520]   I mean, lots and lots and lots of people in pets.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.160]   And just for specific to me, you know, I'm very experienced
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.400]   and with quantum energy, I've been exposed to it
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.520]   for a very long time and really high levels.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.640]   And so I can put myself, like let's say one of my things
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.000]   that I wanted to do for a while was I wanted to try
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.240]   the weight management frequency to see how that worked.
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.200]   And I put a picture of myself in my block
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.400]   with the frequency, you know, like I made a foil
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.400]   and I put the foil in there with the frequency
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.040]   and a picture of myself in there.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.920]   And I just ran that experiment for like two weeks straight.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.880]   I did, I left myself in the block 24 hours a day
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.560]   with the frequency to just really kind of, you know,
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.680]   immerse myself in that frequency.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.400]   And I, you know, and I had a, you know,
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.720]   I could feel it and stuff and that was another story.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.440]   But anyway, so my point though is
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.080]   that I was in the block for two weeks.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.640]   I've got a dog that's been in my infinity block right now
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.800]   for a month and I've never taken her out
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.440]   and I actually did confer with Phillip
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.160]   and Roman took a look at the dog
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.800]   and it was, you know, I was worried that that might be too much
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.400]   but it turns out that it's still not enough
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.480]   for that particular animal.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.160]   But the idea though is that, you know,
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.800]   these are the recommendations.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.400]   You're looking on the screen, the recommendations, you know,
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.240]   it's always going to err on the side of caution, you know,
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.160]   because Layla's a company.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.440]   I'm a person, I'm not, I don't work for them.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.760]   So I'm just telling you from my personal experience, you know,
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.840]   there is nothing wrong or nothing's going to happen.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.320]   Nothing bad has ever happened to me or anyone I've worked with
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.240]   and I've been doing this for years with leaving a picture
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.040]   in for a much longer period of time, you know,
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.760]   literally days, weeks, months, you know, if, you know,
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.200]   if that's kind of like, you know,
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.400]   you want to dedicate a block to that, to that individual.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.160]   So, you know, that's my experience.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.920]   However, the recommendation again is, as you see on the screen.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.840]   Now, the other thing too about using photos and blocks
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.520]   is using locations.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.960]   So, you know, we've talked about people, pets and plants, okay,
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.680]   but what about locations?
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.040]   So, now, if you want to send energy to a location,
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.080]   then, you know, I talked with Philip about this as well,
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.360]   just recently, just to kind of get some real clarity on that
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.840]   because during the Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.720]   that just came through, you know, they hit the United States,
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.600]   there's a lot of people in the, in the chat groups
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.640]   are asking about how do we help these people?
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.480]   How do I, you know, can I send positive energy
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.920]   to any one of those specific towns
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.000]   or maybe just the whole state of North Carolina
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.200]   or the whole state of Florida,
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.360]   or even the whole region of the country?
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.560]   And so, my response to that was like, you know,
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.840]   if you think about how quantum upgrade works,
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.640]   it's all based on location,
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.160]   but what's the definition of location, right?
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.160]   Well, the definition of location is a single property
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.800]   with an address.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.000]   Okay, and that's kind of really what it breaks down to.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.920]   So, I asked him, I said, well, could somebody charge
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.760]   a whole city?
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.000]   And the answer was no.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.040]   It's that the, his response was in, you know,
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.760]   just to kind of paraphrase was,
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.120]   it's just not strong enough to do that big of a space,
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.960]   you know, 'cause all the things that are in that space,
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.000]   all the living creatures, all the buildings,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.400]   all the, you know, just that much land.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.680]   And it's just, they're just, you know,
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.960]   it's just, it's not strong enough to make an effect
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.080]   and it really won't work.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.640]   So, I wanna really point that out,
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.040]   but it will work for a property.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.600]   So, if you have a farm, you know,
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.200]   farms could be big, but it's one single property.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.160]   It has an address and you could target.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.000]   So, you could take a picture of, you know, like,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.760]   one of the things that I did before,
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.160]   there was such a thing as quantum upgrading.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.520]   I went on Google Maps and got a picture
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.040]   of my condo building when I was living in Hawaii.
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.960]   And I basically put a picture of my condo building
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.480]   in my block to send energy to my home, you know,
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.560]   and of course everybody else that lives in the building.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.080]   But that was one way to do it, you know,
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.120]   just go on Google Maps, get a satellite photo of your home
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.800]   or a person's home that you wanna send energy
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.840]   to that person's home and put the picture there.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.640]   And energy and frequency and intention
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.720]   will then go to that single property.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.440]   So, that's the key thing that, you know,
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.640]   I just wanna point out on Philip did clarify that,
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.800]   you know, putting pictures of cities, regions,
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.200]   countries, states, it just doesn't work.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.120]   And then the other thing about locations
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.880]   which is unlike the recommendation for people, pets
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.600]   and plants is that there's no max duration
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.800]   when you're trying to send energy to a location, all right?
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.920]   So, that's really it in a nutshell
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.240]   on how to use photos in blocks, what the guidelines are
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.080]   and so forth.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.440]   So, I just wanna share that with you.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.400]   I hope you found this educational and before I leave,
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.720]   you with this, I kinda wanna share with you
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.120]   what other people in the Telegram chat groups
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.000]   are doing with photos in blocks, okay?
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.960]   'Cause one of the greatest things about our chat group
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.840]   is we are a community, we're learning from each other.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:22.920]   I mean, some of the best ideas
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.840]   that Leila has actually incorporated
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.480]   into their products and so forth have come from you.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.680]   And so, I wanna share this incredible testimony
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.520]   that popped up in the Quantum Power Group
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.600]   where an individual, one of our members,
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.680]   basically put a picture of his wife's knees in his block.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.960]   And so, basically, this is what he said in the picture.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.800]   He says, I put two photos of my wife's leg
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.200]   in my new upgraded or upcharged infinity block, okay?
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:53.000]   After four years, five surgeries and a little bit of pain
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.640]   and never more than two hours of sleep at a time,
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.560]   her pain is gone.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.120]   It's been five days now, this is amazing.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.440]   And this is a testimony, it's unsolicited.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.480]   It's just someone who bought a, you know, got a block
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.920]   and gave it a try and wow, these are the results.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.840]   And this is unsolicited, they just posted this photo
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.320]   with this text and it's just an amazing testimony
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.200]   of how this person was able to help his wife
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.000]   using photos and blocks.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.560]   And now I've done this too and I've got some testimonies
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.840]   as well as things that have gone really well.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.200]   But as I got here right here,
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.000]   I just wanna point out, results vary by individual and by pet.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.360]   And so, I've worked with, you know,
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.720]   tried this with some dogs and, you know, they get better,
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.480]   their owners report that they're up and running around
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.040]   or they're just acting better,
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.280]   they're eating or whatever now.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.960]   And then if other reports were like nothing happened at all.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.880]   You know, so it does really vary by individual,
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.440]   but this is a great story on how one person helped their wife
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.480]   and it did work.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.680]   And that's just giving you an idea of the possibilities here.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.520]   And I kind of just also wanted to share
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.240]   'cause this is always fun.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.120]   If you go into the media section of our Telegram chat group,
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.360]   you'll see people doing stuff as, you know,
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.480]   all these different videos that I'm making are talking
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.240]   about what people are doing and how to do it.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.040]   But I just wanna show you some pictures
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.320]   that people have posted.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.720]   And here's one person that was sending a frequency
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.520]   using numerical codes.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.600]   That's a whole other subject.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.920]   I covered that in a video (laughs)
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.440]   if you're interested in how to do that.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.160]   But they're just using, they're sending a frequency
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:31.160]   off of a code number to this lady using their block.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:34.800]   Here's the person sending a frequency to a dog,
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.760]   that little piece of foil that's got the frequency on it.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.000]   Another person using their frequency with the dog,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.280]   here's the foil with the frequency on it.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.320]   And here's someone that's sending frequency to a cult.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.960]   No, you know, not frequency, but energy, just pure energy.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.920]   Here's an individual with an intention
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.320]   in their infinity block.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.960]   So they've got the picture of the person
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.520]   and then they've got of themselves, I think,
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.440]   and then it says, "I am strong, fit and healthy."
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.720]   You know, and so that's just, you know,
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.120]   you're giving yourself your manifesting intention
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.440]   for yourself by putting that in there in the block.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.800]   Someone that's just sending energy,
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.800]   just a picture of a person, a picture of, I think,
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.840]   is a calf or a sheep, can't tell.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.400]   And then of course, this is me treating my dog.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.880]   And I believe I was using a,
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.840]   I was using dog booster frequency that I created.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.720]   Just, it's kind of like a men's booster,
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.800]   but it's for dogs.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.040]   And so, you know, it's just sending,
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.920]   I'm just trying to help them feel better.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.240]   And I was using my block for that back in the old days.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.800]   And then here's another one where someone called me up
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.280]   and a friend of theirs needed some help.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.880]   And so I'm sending the heel frequency to this lady
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.040]   and trying to help her out.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.680]   So that's just kind of just kind of some examples
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.880]   of what other people are doing that I wanted to share with you.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.520]   And then, you know, this is kind of a real thing.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.560]   And you are highly encouraged as a block owner.
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.600]   Give this a try.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.720]   Let us know, post in the chat group how it worked out for you,
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.360]   you know, and we all learn together, okay?
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.560]   So anyway, thank you for watching.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.920]   Hope this was helpful.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.520]   And you learned something in Vylandang to our German friends.
[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.360]   I hope this was helpful as well for you folks.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.880]   And if you want to follow Leila Quantum Tech
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.520]   and quantum upgrade information and news,

[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.400]   Aloha.
