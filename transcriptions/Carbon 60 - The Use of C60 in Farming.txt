[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another carbon 60 video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and this video
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:12.960]   I'd like to share with you my research on the use of C60 in farming and how I got this idea was I was just reading some random C60 studies
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.360]   Yeah, I know I do that and
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.240]   I came across a study on
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.680]   Scientists had it tested C60 supplementation on pigs and the results were pretty amazing
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.760]   And so it got me thinking, you know, what else can C60 do in the area of farming that could really be?
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.720]   true game changer in terms of
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.720]   Increasing yields and you know all the things that farmers seek to try to do with crops and animals
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.840]   But without using chemicals and without using, you know, techniques like gmo
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.680]   So it would be really was a really interesting little piece of research that I did
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.280]   I wanted to share it with you
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.920]   For those of you who are interested in how C60 can help your crops and this could apply to your plants your garden at home
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.280]   As well as animals and so and not just animals you eat
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.880]   But you know animals in general so I thought I'd just share it with you and you know, I found it interesting thought you would too
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.960]   So let's jump right in so the very first thing and this is just an overall summary
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.000]   With regards to C60 in use of crops in agriculture
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.680]   Carbon 60 fullerene is being explored as a potential nano material to enhance plant growth and yield by acting as an antioxidant
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.920]   Just like it does with humans, right?
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.920]   It does it does the same with plants now potentially improving the stress tolerance in plants by mitigating the effects of environmental stressors
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:41.520]   Like drought uv radiation and extreme temperatures while also increasing water retention capacity in the soil and potentially boosting nutrient uptake
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.800]   And this is what the overall summary of the other research is
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.160]   And I kind of cherry picked some studies to share with you to kind of
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.080]   Exampleify what the scientists have discovered in their studies and the key points though that I wanted to point out about crops
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.200]   And C60 is that it has the same antioxidant properties that it does with animals as it does with plants, right?
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.200]   And the key thing here is that it enhances water retention of the plants which is
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.600]   critical for drought resistance
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.240]   And also in the in the uptake of nutrients that the plants were demonstrating and and the ability for the plants to handle stress
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.240]   And that these are all huge pluses, right? If you're a farmer and so some of the research
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.960]   And I just cherry picked a few studies to show you
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.520]   Now number one is the study and it's called innovative approaches for improving the quality and resilience of spring barley seeds
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.160]   Seeds the role of nanotechnology and phytoplological analysis. Okay, there's a mouthful
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.000]   Now what they found out in this study was that they showed that fullerene C60 and carbon nanotubes
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.440]   Increase the water holding capacity biomass and yield of plant fruits by a hundred and eighteen percent
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.000]   You know, that's about that was the average of the group and that's a hundred and eighteen. That's double
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   So, you know that can you imagine if you were a farmer and you could double your yield
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.800]   By using C60 in the soil, which is you know, and then at the end of the day, you know
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.440]   They concluded which was it was an outstanding achievement by nanotechnology in recent years
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.440]   And there's actually another study that kind of came with this
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.880]   But it was a little redundant, but the other study that I was reading showed
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.080]   They did it with tomatoes instead of you know, this was barley seeds
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.120]   And scientists had done a study on tomatoes and they had come up with an increased yield
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.240]   Of 200 percent. So it's three times the size, you know, let's can imagine a tomato
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.360]   That's three times bigger just by using carbon 16
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.000]   And so that was what the other studies finding so the bottom line though is the interesting thing
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.760]   With this study in this particular area of research was the increasing yields by simply using carbon 60
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.960]   And carbon 60 is not toxic. It is a natural forming carbon allotropin nature
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.720]   So we're trying to you know, here's an idea where you can use nature to improve
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.480]   nature
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.040]   In the simplest of forms and I thought this was just really interesting and how you can increase the size of the fruits
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.360]   That you're you're creating, you know, the size of your yields
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.600]   In whatever you're growing, you know, by two or three times as big
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.400]   And or more
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.760]   From every plant that you're, you know, putting in the ground another study that was called the effects of fullerene 60 on the uptake of nitrogen
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.440]   And mineral elements and crops using synchrotosis. This is the the technology they used in the study was they used the synchrotron radiation
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.240]   Micro x-ray fluorescence spectrometry and they use stable isotope labeling
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.600]   That's what they did to kind of analyze the the idea of nutrient or nitrogen and mineral uptake
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:39.920]   And what they discovered in this study was that c60 can improve the uptake of nitrogen and change mineral elements in crops
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.680]   Possibly avoiding damage to soils and the environment caused by the overuse of fertilizers
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:53.280]   And increasing the yield quantity and quality of crops and why that's so important if you understand modern day agriculture
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.960]   Fertilizers are derivatives of oil
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.960]   And natural gas primarily and these hydrocarbons go into the soil
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.760]   There's only three basic elements of fertilizers that are derived from hydrocarbons
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.400]   And as the plants are grown with these three basic, you know, fertilizers
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.240]   You know from hydrocarbons the plants suck it all up and after a while
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.560]   You know, the soil is without additional fertilizer the soil dies
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.760]   It just gets depleted because there's really nothing going on
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.680]   Except for the fertilizer and the plants take it all up now with carbon 60
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.680]   They're finding that it can actually prevent that and instead of using these hydrocarbon type of fertilizers
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.640]   You can use natural fertilizers plus c60 and you leave the soil healthy and that's a really important
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.200]   Finding is that c60 protects the soil now there is
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.960]   Another aspect of this and I kind of wanted to point out which was an other scientist said looked at
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.800]   You know, it looked at the idea of okay. Well, here's the concept right
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.680]   What can c60 do for plant yields plant growth plant stability, but also these scientists looked at and said well
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.880]   What happens when you know what does happen if you put c60 in your soil
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.640]   Does it end up in the plants and does it end up in what people eat and that was the important thing
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.240]   Was what happens after you eat these plants that have this, you know, c60 in the soil and so what this study
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.160]   Demonstrated was it's called c60 fullerene soil
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.960]   Sorption biodegradation and plant uptake now this study
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.080]   They looked at that they looked at specifically what you know, what is the plant doing like how much of it
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.200]   How much of the c60 does it pull up into its into its body?
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.480]   Let's say
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.760]   And so there was little co2 production in the slit slum or the sandy loam soil
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:46.160]   After 754 days and 328 days respectively suggesting high resistance to 660 to mineralization in soil meaning the plants
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   used the c60
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.080]   But they didn't really uptake it and what they measured in the actual plant up taking c60 into its
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.960]   I guess they call it, you know your see the plant's body
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.080]   The plant uptake was generally low, you know
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.960]   With most of the uptake taken carbon accumulating in the roots
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.240]   So what they found was that a lot of the carbon the c60 was accumulating up to 40 to 47
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.840]   Of the carbon in the plant was in the roots, right?
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.240]   So that's good if you you know, if you don't want people eating the the c60 that means
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.200]   You know, it's gonna stay in the ground like, you know, like all the different kinds of crops that you don't eat the roots
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.680]   You eat the you know, they're yield and then the smaller amounts were accumulated in the tubers
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.360]   22 to 23 percent the stems held 12
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.880]   They found c60 in the stems 12 to 60 percent and they found
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.720]   In the leaves the carbon 60 was 18 to 22 percent in the leaves
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.680]   So what that kind of demonstrated was that the majority of the c60 that the plants are using
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.120]   Are not going to be in the fruits or vegetables that you'll end up eating
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.720]   Right, that's kind of what they found
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:56.160]   And then they they went on to say our results indicate that c60 released to the environment will not be highly bioavailable
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.560]   Right because it's gonna pretty much stay with the parts of the plants that people are not eating
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.400]   But will likely persist in soil for extended periods
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:10.720]   Which was what you know, the ultimate game is you want the c60 to stay in the soil unlike hydrocarbon fertilizers
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.440]   You want the c60 to always be in there working for the next, you know crop that you plant
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:20.800]   So that was a really interesting, you know aspect of c60s used in agriculture
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.240]   Was this idea of okay, you know, what is it?
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.880]   You know, what is the plant uptake and what does it do to the soil?
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.360]   And so I thought that was real interesting and I wanted to share that with you
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.440]   So then when we look at animals and we look at c60s use with animals
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.680]   In farming animal husbandry the in the animal husbandry industry carbon 60
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.040]   Full array in c60 is being researched as a potential
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:50.320]   Dietary supplement due to its potential antioxidant properties with studies showing it may improve meat quality
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:57.440]   Enhanced animal health by mitigating oxidative stress and potentially even extend lifespan in some animal models
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.320]   By protecting against cellular damage caused by free radicals. So this is all the stuff you hear
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.960]   Uh, you know when people are trying to sell you c60 oil for your own health that actually applies to the animals as well
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.560]   Uh, and and in a whole different aspect because you know, we eat those animals as opposed to you know, humans
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.880]   So the key points with c60s use with animals is that it does have the same antioxidant effects
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.720]   Scientists have found that okay works the same in animals as it does humans
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.920]   But the interesting thing was that the meat quality improved the potential lifespan
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.080]   Extension is there which is really critical for like, you know, if you think about
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.520]   You have animals that produce but if you can get your animals to live longer
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.800]   They can produce more right whether it's milk or eggs or whatever
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.360]   And then the other thing too was the delivery method, right?
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.000]   So how you know how they kind of expand, you know experimented with
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.960]   Uh, the different delivery methods of how to how to supplement animals with c60 and then the important considerations that the scientists overall
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.040]   Uh discovered was that doses in toxicity was an issue now toxicity
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:03.040]   They determined there was no toxicity and the dosage was, you know, they had to experiment like, you know, how much c60 do you give
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.880]   Uh, different animals, uh, the regulatory approach obviously would be a huge deal because you're putting something into the food supply
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.760]   Uh, and then you know, there's limited research on farm animals and i'll kind of show you that too
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:20.320]   So I again, I cherry picked a few studies to kind of share with you to kind of exemplify these points that were made in the summary
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.240]   Now the very first one is the is the famous c60 rat study in paris
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.280]   Now this was on rats. Obviously, you know, we don't eat rats or
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.800]   least western world people who don't eat rats, but you know this this study though really was
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:41.520]   Uh quite profound in terms of its findings and the studies called the prolongation of lifespan of rats by repeated oil administration of c60
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:48.400]   Fullering so they fed a bunch of rats with c60 and this is what they discovered when you fed these animals with c60 oil
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.440]   And the results show that while all of oil treatment when they you know can lead to an increase of 18
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.120]   Lifespan of treated rats. Let me read that again so you guys understand
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.960]   Just olive oil can lead to an increase of 18 lifespan
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.440]   Up treated rats. Okay, so
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.120]   Olive oil right off the bat, you know longevity hack right there
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.840]   Uh, but c60 oil olive oil can increase it up to 90
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.280]   As compared to the controls now these results confirm the hypothesis according to which of the
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:25.680]   This fullerene is an active is active against oxidative stress, but only in soluble form
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:32.880]   And then these results strengthen the dose effect relationship and confirm that c60 is a powerful
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:41.600]   Liver protective agent and so the key on this study here was that by giving animals c60 in olive oil
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.160]   Okay, uh in a soluble oil. Uh, they lived up to 90
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   Longer
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.720]   And the thing about it was they were using lab rats that are basically genetically
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.440]   Designed to get you know to basically develop tumors and then die
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.360]   You know quickly early, you know, so that you know, you don't want to study to go 10 years
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.280]   You'd never be able to publish but so you know
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.160]   They're using lab rats that are designed to get cancer and die and so when they did the pathology on these rats
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:16.720]   Uh, they lived twice as long and then when they did the pathology as as the rats continued to die over the over the extended lifespan
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:22.320]   Uh, the pathology on various different organs of the rats specifically the liver
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.560]   They didn't find any tumors
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:30.240]   So a hidden little gem in this study is not only did the rats live longer the animals live longer
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:36.880]   They lived healthier and they didn't develop diseases like they that that they're pre-programmed genetically to develop
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.400]   Which is astounding because you know, there's all these uh, you know
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.040]   One of the biggest issues with animal husbandry right is disease
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.840]   And can you imagine if you had this magic little thing called c60 you could feed your animals
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.720]   They they live longer and then they're more pre- you know resilient to diseases pretty fascinating
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:59.600]   Now another study here called the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of liposomal c60 at the cellular molecular
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:05.120]   Molecular and whole animal levels and now this was a study done on beagles on dogs
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:13.600]   So they studied the c60 on dogs and in summary a trace amount of the hydro phobics c60 and hydrophilic
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.560]   media effectively produced anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in cells and animals
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.560]   And so what they discovered was that the c60 and they used grapeseed oil in this study
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.400]   But the c60 dissolved in grapeseed oil is a novel anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drug
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.840]   candidate
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.480]   Meaning this they discovered that you know for dogs
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.960]   This was really really helpful in making them disease resistant because the you know
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:43.600]   The the source of a lot of diseases is inflammation and by feeding your dogs
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.560]   Or in this case beagle dogs or feeding let's say your cattle your sheep whatever
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.840]   You're going to basically help them become more disease resistant
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:57.760]   By having this anti-inflammatory effect and that's pretty amazing. Now the last one here is that I found
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:05.360]   Another study called the dietary zero dimensional fullerene supplementation improves meat quality lipid metabolism
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.360]   Muscle fiber characteristics and antioxidant status and finishing pigs
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.720]   Now this was that study that I mentioned this was the only study I could find on actual farm animals
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.600]   But you know animals are animals and we are animals so this applies to us
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.360]   But the thing that was really fascinating was they were looking at just basically, you know meat producing animals
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:29.520]   What happens when you feed them c60 now in this study compared to the control group
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:36.480]   Dietary c60 supplementation increased the ph3h and flesh color and marbling scores
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.200]   And they tended to increase in the c60 group, okay, so the meat looked better
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.200]   You know, which is really important if you're going to try to sell something to somebody right
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:53.120]   And then also the results revealed that the dietary c60 supplementation led to a shift of muscle fibers from a type
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:15:02.560]   To be to a type to a which means that it causing it caused more tenderness of the meat thus improving meat quality
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:09.120]   Now there's this other marker that they use in in basically, you know defining the quality of meat called imf
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.000]   Sorry, I don't know what that stands for but imf is correlated with juiciness and flavor
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.760]   Now there the present study showed that c60 could increase imf and sfa content
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:28.080]   And this result might be associated with the metabolism of fatty acids and skeletal muscle
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:36.160]   Including fatty acid biosynthesis fatty acid oxidation and lipid transport which regulates the fat content of skeletal muscle
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:42.080]   So for those of you who are familiar with you know, like the difference between wagyu beef and regular beef
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.680]   You know, it's all about marbling. It's all about the fat content
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.960]   It's all about the the muscle fibers and making making sure that you know that you want the meat to be
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.400]   Delicious because it's got a real high fatty content
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.600]   You want it to be tender you want it to look nice, you know, because you're trying to sell a product
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:07.600]   And this was an amazing study on c60 on pigs that basically turns out that if you feed pigs c60
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.480]   The quality of the meat they're going to taste better
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.320]   They're going to taste better and they're going to it's going to look good
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.280]   Um, and it's just going to be juicy and flavorful
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.760]   Which really kind of is real interesting because you know all of you out there that are interested c60
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:29.120]   You're taking c60. So congratulations. You are now tastier than you ever been before in your whole life
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.960]   But that's that's the that's the result of the study
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:38.960]   So it's really an amazing thing. So in summary when we look at the use of c60 and farming
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:46.320]   It's got some great potential in crops water retention nutrient uptake stress tolerance increased yields and animals
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:52.320]   You've got improved health potential lifespan extension and the improvement in the meat quality
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.040]   Was all demonstrated through these science studies. Now. I do want to leave you with one idea here
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:04.000]   There's a huge challenge though, and you know, you know it right off the bat if you're, you know, if you're buying c60, you know, and it's the cost effectiveness
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.120]   So right now, um
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:11.040]   Obviously, you know based on what it costs. There's no way in the world
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.280]   Any farmer out there can afford to put c60 in the ground
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.640]   On a regular basis. I mean just you know taking c60 as a supplement as a human is expensive
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.400]   So I think that while they're at the pinch debt, but the potential is there
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:29.520]   The reality check is that right now at this time, you know 2025 there hasn't been
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:36.480]   Uh, you know, uh an ability to mass produce c60 for use in agriculture yet
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.760]   And I think that's going to be my next research project is to see where do we stand on that on that ability
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.800]   Uh for science to develop techniques to you know to
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.160]   Synthesize c60 from carbon use most likely they use the graphite
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:57.600]   They just extract c60 from graphite and can it be done on such a large scale to reduce the price enough for use in agriculture?
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.200]   So yeah, obviously, you know, this video is just to kind of kind of convey
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:07.760]   The potential and the incredible benefits that science scientists are finding with results to plants and animals
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.920]   Uh, but at the end of the day, you know, until there's a cost effectiveness
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:16.400]   Uh, you know in terms of being able to buy c60 in bulk for use in agriculture
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.920]   And with animals, you know, it's it's not going to actually happen
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.760]   But the potential is there and I think that's what's important because you know
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.400]   Who's to say that you know, let's say five years from now 10 years from now
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.080]   Somebody doesn't come along and find a way to just produce tons of this stuff
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.760]   You know c60
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.600]   And then farmers can start using it in place of this, you know the chemicals they use
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:41.840]   And then you can see some of these incredible results that farmers will have so so this video is really early
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:49.680]   It's but you know what it does convey the reality that c60 is incredibly beneficial to farming
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:56.160]   Uh, it's just a matter of time and when it's going to be available at a price where it can be used for farming
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.800]   And that's the point of the video is that yes, it's great
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:03.040]   Not you know, it may not be time yet, but hey, you know what the idea is there
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.360]   The research is incredible. It's fascinating stuff and I just wanted to share with you
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.520]   I thought you would find it interesting too. So thank you for watching if you got any questions about c60
