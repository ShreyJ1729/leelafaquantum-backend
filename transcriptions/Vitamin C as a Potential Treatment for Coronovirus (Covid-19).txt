[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another video by me K Elmer and in this video I
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.040]   would like to share with you something much more serious than any of the other
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.000]   topics that I have covered in my prior videos and this is the potential for
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.640]   vitamin C to be a treatment for the coronavirus and I'm going to tell you
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.640]   in a second exactly what I mean by that I have to jump into the disclaimers real

[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.640]   affiliations I don't make money in any way shape or form with these videos this
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.800]   is purely part of my learning journey and I've done a lot of research lately
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.520]   for obvious reasons on the coronavirus and I've discovered some information that
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.640]   I feel is very very important to share with you so let's jump in now the most
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.520]   important thing that I wanted to point out right away is there was a press
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.320]   release today is Monday February 17 there was a press release four days ago from
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.920]   the Zonghan Hospital in Wuhan China is now doing a clinical trial with 24,000
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.320]   milligrams of vitamin C to be administered to the coronavirus patients
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.520]   intravenously for seven days this popped up on clinical trials.gov's website so
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.280]   now there's two things that I get from this is one that they're running out of
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.080]   ideas and two they're they're actually going to go to some alternative methods
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.840]   that normally big pharma has looked down upon this is very significant that the
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.640]   coronavirus is now or the Chinese are now researching high dose vitamin C and I'm
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   going to get into the actual documented research on vitamin C's efficacy towards
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.720]   multitude of different infectious diseases here in a second but just to
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.480]   point this out this is a huge development in the seriousness of this
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.160]   situation if one that they're actually publishing that they're doing this and
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.120]   see that they're actually doing it so this is quite amazing the second thing I
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.480]   want to point out in addition to vitamin C there are there's hospitals in Korea
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.000]   that are actually using oxygen therapy for coronavirus as well and they're
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.400]   actually getting working results so you can by the way all of the links on
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.040]   everything everything that I am showing you is in the video description I
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.960]   encourage everyone to do their own research and by and by all means you
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.400]   should know what you're doing and you should understand the situation but this
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.120]   art this is two incredibly valuable pieces of information that just came out
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.440]   this week on what can possibly help you and help your family when when and not
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.560]   if this arrives at your doorstep so now with that in mind I just want to point
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.800]   out that my last video which was how to treat viruses or viral infections with
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   the Bob Beck protocol this is a little bit of validation towards what the work
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.040]   of Bob Beck because as I demonstrated or as I mentioned in that prior video the
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.120]   Bob Beck protocol consists of four major steps which is blood electrification
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.280]   clodal silver ozone and PMF and then I had mentioned in that video that I also
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.600]   personally add liposomal vitamin C as part of my regimen but I want to point
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.800]   out that two of the of the five things that I mentioned are now being tried in
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.240]   China to try to treat the coronavirus and I'm sorry and also South Korea and
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.960]   we know for a fact that the Korean one is working so these are two of the Bob
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.000]   Beck so if anyone is very interested in and what that protocol is then definitely
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.680]   go look at that other video link in the description so this is I just wanted to
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.520]   share that so the first thing I want to mention for everybody out there is you
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.880]   know you wouldn't think that a vitamin would possibly help and that is
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.280]   absolutely you know you're right on to think that because it just doesn't make
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.160]   any sense we've gone to doctors and pharmacists and I mean but it's true that
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.080]   there is if you do the research okay and I just implore everyone you know do
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.880]   the research if you if you find this to be strange information to you for those
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.480]   of you who get it good for you but if you if you if you don't if you're
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.160]   uncomfortable with this idea let me share something the tip of an iceberg of a
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.640]   tremendous body of knowledge that will then you give you the actual data that
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.360]   whatever level of data that you need to feel comfortable I'm gonna be quoting
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.640]   two doctors Dr. Thomas Levy Dr. Robert Cathcart in this video and also be
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.520]   quoting a nutritionalist his name is Andrew Saul so one of the things that I
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.320]   do want to mention it for those of you who are in the the science of things is
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.000]   a quote by Dr. Robert Cathcart and basically he wrote in one of his in one
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.160]   of his documents I read so many as he said I want to emphasize first that the
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.040]   main reason that massive doses of vitamin C work against infectious diseases has
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.440]   little to do with the vitamin C functions as ordinarily understood they work in
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.880]   massive doses because we are throwing away the vitamin C for the extra
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.400]   electrons carried these extra extra electrons neutralized their free
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   radicals molecules missing electrons that mediate all inflammation and causes
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.960]   the symptoms and deaths from these infectious diseases it is not really a
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.160]   matter of medicine it is a matter of chemistry all right so that's a very
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.080]   important aspect of the idea of hey how could vitamins you know or vitamin C
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.920]   specifically treat an infectious disease it's it's not about medicine it's
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.540]   about chemistry so let me just kind of walk you through a little bit of and all
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.840]   of the links are in the video description you know and by I encourage
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.840]   everybody to go down that path and and take a look at the research but the
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.640]   most important thing I could share with you if you have any doubt whether or
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.480]   not vitamin C could possibly work even though the Chinese are actually trying to
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.200]   use it now is to look at this video that I put a link in there it's the
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.520]   applications of vitamin C theoretical and practical by Dr. Thomas Levy he did a
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.800]   three-part lecture series and this is part three it is a two-hour video all
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.640]   right but I want to I just I'm pointing out one slide of his of his power point
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.800]   presentation in his lecture and this was done in back in July 2017 and just I
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.600]   wanted to point out this slide because I think it's it's profound because in
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.400]   this lecture this to our lecture he goes over all of the documented history of
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.800]   how vitamin C has been you know has been curing diseases all sorts of
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.800]   different diseases and all of the different studies that have been done by
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.160]   all these different doctors over time and so he covers this entire two-hour
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.120]   body of knowledge that says hey here's the proof all right and so this is just
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.440]   the one slide and I just wanted to share this with you because this is a study
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.600]   that he shares in this video where he basically showing what vitamin C has
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:35.920]   been proven already proven to do was there was a 1949 study in which they
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.440]   treated polio victims with vitamin C and I want to point this out right here
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:50.680]   60 of the 60 cases were cured 60 of the 60 patients were cured and if you listen
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:56.320]   to this lecture I believe 57 of them were cured in a few days and then the other
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:02.000]   three took a few more days after that and they were cured of polio no vaccines
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.400]   no medicine high doses of vitamin C did that so there's other research that is
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.640]   linked in the vital in the video description vitamin C and its
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.140]   application of treatment of coronavirus there's an article on orthomolecular.org
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.940]   there's a there's a study that's been done by the efficacy of vitamin C and
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.840]   reducing duration of severe pneumonia in children and this is this is what
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:28.400]   coronavirus is doing its first mutation is the cause of death is ARDS which is
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.960]   acute respiratory distress and that's essentially pneumonia and that's what's
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.960]   killing everybody is that that level the problem with their lungs and here is a
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.280]   paper a study that was done with children that showed vitamin C greatly
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.800]   reduced the symptoms that were of pneumonia in children there's a nutritional
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.300]   nutritional treatment of coronavirus so here's just a really good article some
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.020]   background on influenza and SARS and so forth and then basically the
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.980]   recommendation of nutritional supplements that will help you protect
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:02.900]   yourself from coronavirus also included in the video description is this article
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.720]   by Dr. Cathcart and the treatment of infectious diseases with massive doses of
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.540]   vitamin C and this is where he talks about it and then he's got all of his
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.220]   reference links there so well so you know that's that is the research I don't
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.720]   want to spend an hour talking about the research I just want to let you know that
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.540]   it exists and it's there in the video description I encourage you to read it
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:27.660]   it is proven vitamin C works for infectious diseases that's my point now
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.120]   moving right along what's the difference now between the different forms of
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:38.440]   vitamin C you could take so in the in the clinical trial in China right now in
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.400]   Wuhan they're using intravenous vitamin C so if you if you notice that in the
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.840]   article let me go back to it right here basically they're talking about that
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.000]   China is conducting a clinical trial of 24,000 milligrams per day
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.880]   intravenous that's you know through you know through your IV right and so
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.720]   what's the difference between intravenous regular vitamin C that you take
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.280]   you know capsules and then this other thing called liposomal vitamin C there's
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.360]   three ways you could take it you could take it with an IV bag you know needle
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.160]   into your vein you could take it tablets right off you know right you buy it to
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.640]   drug drug drug I'm sorry the drug store or you could take it through another
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.200]   means called liposomal vitamin C all right I want to walk you through the
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.920]   three ways the very first thing is what's the difference between regular
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.400]   vitamin C and liposomal vitamin C so probably a lot of you know that
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.920]   vitamin C is water-soluble right and so you don't really absorb if you take
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.840]   anything over 2,000 milligrams a day or literally it's the actual number is
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.880]   1,250 milligrams if you take more than that the more you take the less and less
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.200]   and less your body absorbs because you immediately get saturated and then your
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.040]   body goes oh I had enough and then it just flushes the rest of you rest of
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.200]   the vitamin C out okay so but then so if you try to do a high dosage vitamin C
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.400]   which is you know obviously you know the clinical trial in China is 24,000
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.120]   milligrams so obviously you'd be taking well over the threshold if you took 24,000
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.120]   milligrams of vitamin C by tablet all right your efficacy rate or your
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.240]   the ability for you to for that vitamin C to work for you for you to absorb it
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:20.360]   would be only 16% because of the way your body eliminates you know soluble
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:26.900]   substances so it's only got a 16% absorption rate by tablet so clearly this
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.800]   is why the Chinese are using intravenous and they're not using tablets not just
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.440]   giving people pills all right so that's a very important part so we're gonna put
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.360]   vitamin regular vitamin C off to the side now let's talk about liposomal the
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.800]   thing about liposomal and what liposomal is and I'll actually show you some
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.480]   diagrams but it's basically taking the vitamin C molecule itself and wrapping
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.160]   it in fat cells and when you when you wrap a substance or a nutrient or in
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:58.040]   wrap it in fat cells and you ingest it your body takes it in as fat it thinks
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.320]   it's food and it gets processed through your lymphatic system and liposomal
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.640]   vitamin C has shown that it has a 98% efficiency that means that if you take
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:15.440]   vitamin C in a liposomal form wrapped in fat then you will actually absorb 98% of
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.080]   the vitamin C that you take so you can imagine that it is literally the most
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.520]   efficient way to take vitamin C with the least amount of loss like you know
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:31.920]   you're over here at 16% you're basically and you're urinating literally you
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.520]   know 84% of the vitamin C you're taking you urinating it out and that's
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.620]   essentially money down the drain in a lot of waste of time over here you're
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:45.440]   gonna get literally all of it okay so the next thing that's important to
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.040]   understand is we can so what's the difference between intravenously taking
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:55.400]   vitamin C through you know IV bag and needle or drinking liposomal vitamin
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:01.000]   C and this is where the research gets fascinating the research by Dr. Thomas
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.600]   Levy found that through years of clinical experience that much a much
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:11.180]   smaller oral dose of what he called like a lipospheric which is liposomal
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.720]   same thing a vitamin C all right there you could take literally and this is
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:24.440]   what he found that 5 to 10 grams of liposomal vitamin C often results in a
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.920]   similar clinical response as much as a much larger dose of vitamin C given
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:37.520]   intravenously 25 to 100 grams which is which is monumental that means that
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:44.520]   liposomal is by far the most efficient way far above intravenous far above
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.360]   intravenous if you look at these two numbers you're looking at anything from
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:57.960]   80% to 10% so you know the of you would only have to take either 10 or 20% as
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:04.160]   much of the vitamin C through liposomal as you would IV and you would get the
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.760]   same you would get similar results this is a critical number keeping keep track
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:15.600]   of this of this 10 to 20% okay the 5 to 25 is 5 is 20% and then 10 to 100 is
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.880]   10% so it's a 10 to 20% spread okay that's I'm gonna be getting into the
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.840]   dosages in a second so this is profound it's it's very important it means that
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:31.260]   liposomal vitamin C is the way to go all right so now let me explain a little
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:36.000]   further as I said what exactly that is so a couple of things in order to make
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.440]   liposomal vitamin C you use lethosin so what is lethosin well
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:47.460]   lethosin is simply a phospholipids it's fat cells okay in oil obtained by
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:53.080]   water de-gumming the extracted oil of seeds so that's what this is it's got a
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.760]   hydrophilic head and it's got a hydrophobic tail and that's what it
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.840]   looks like kind of this is drawing right but this is what a little fat cell
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:05.800]   looks like and then what happens is when is you when you take lethosin and you
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.800]   put another nutrient in it and you could put like vitamin C this is how we make
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:16.000]   C60 oil you can do liposomal glutathione there's lots of different things you
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.400]   could make with liposomes with liposomes where you add a nutrient you add
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:25.440]   lethosin water and then you've got liposomes okay now a liposome is this
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.940]   spherical shaped vesicle that is composed of one or more phospholicit
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:36.460]   phospholipid bilayers which closely resembles the structure of cell membranes
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:41.300]   which is how your body thinks of it as food and that's how you absorb it so what
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:48.100]   happens is that the vitamin C molecule gets trapped in a layer of these little
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:53.180]   phospholipids and it becomes it becomes it kind of like mass it where the vitamin
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:59.620]   C is now hidden in fat and the body thinks it's food so that's what a liposome is
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:03.820]   and that's what liposomal vitamin C is it's a whole bunch of those liposomes
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.860]   with vitamin C in the inside and lethosin on the outside and it tricks the body
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.940]   into thinking it's a fat cell so now let's step back for a sec and go okay well
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:17.820]   with all that set all right we know well how much would I take how how much of
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:23.020]   liposomal vitamin C should you take should you be worried about coronavirus
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:28.540]   and God forbid you get it or someone you love gets it okay so here's some back
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:33.180]   of the napkin math that I did I want to share with you and it is completely
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:37.780]   estimated all right so just you know bear with me it's all estimations nothing's
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.900]   proven the trial just started but the you know with coronavirus okay but there's
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.460]   a lot of proven science for other viruses that have been around for a while
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:51.140]   and that's kind of where I'm putting my numbers together you'll see here as I
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:56.100]   talk about it so now this is what I'm thinking is the estimated dosage of
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:00.820]   liposomal vitamin C first things first the formula for vitamin C if you I mean
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.340]   liposomal vitamin C okay if I wanted to make a little batch of liposomal
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:10.660]   vitamin C the simplest formula is I take one tablespoon of vitamin C and put it
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.620]   in four ounces of water I take three tablespoons of lethosin put it in eight
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.700]   ounces of water and mix them together what that gives me is 12 ounces of
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:23.380]   liposomal vitamin C that's a soda can right can a soda full of liposomal
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:28.580]   vitamin C by mixing these three things together so now if you weigh out how
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:32.140]   much that vitamin C weighs one tablespoon of vitamin C and by the way
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.620]   this is gonna be a video at the end one tablespoon of vitamin C equals 12 grams
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.740]   okay I waited out which is 12,000 milligrams so now if you remember that
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.660]   quote Thomas Levy said that five to ten grams of liposomal has the same
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:52.620]   results as 25 to 100 grams of IV intravenous so if you take that math and
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.780]   you say all right the Chinese in Wuhan are doing a clinical trial right now of
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:04.860]   24,000 milligrams of IV vitamin C per day right for seven days so that equates
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:10.340]   to if you were to do them the math on that what's 10 you know basically this
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:16.700]   is my range right the 10 to 20 percent if I wanted to do 10 to 20 percent of
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:23.500]   that I would be taking as in liposomal form all right I'll be taking 2,400 to
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:29.900]   4,800 milligrams per day if in lipo form and how does that translate to the
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:37.540]   actual ounces of liposomal vitamin C you would be drinking 2.4 to 4.8 ounces of
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:44.340]   liposomal vitamin C per day so this clinical trial with this amount of
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:49.780]   intravenous vitamin C for 24,000 milligrams of IV if you instead of
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:56.500]   giving them IV you could the same result you would get with 2.4 to 4.8 ounces of
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:02.300]   liposomal vitamin C per day so if you wanted to let's say duplicate the trial
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.660]   that's how that's as much liposomal vitamin C that you would need to drink
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:11.980]   okay but here's some more data in the research that I was looking at there's
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:19.260]   this one article that I found that talked about the the treatment infectious
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:24.060]   disease so I'm sorry to hear and so in this article this was about SARS and so
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:29.140]   Andrew Saul wrote the article and he basically was researching SARS way back
[00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.260]   and I think it was at least you know 10 years ago right and so there was this
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.420]   paragraph in this in this article I found to be really amazing was he he
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.020]   mentioned it right here is the quote and I took it right out of this article of
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.540]   course links and available in the description and this is what the the
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:49.220]   paragraph says he says basically Dr. Cathcart advocated treating influenza
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:55.540]   with up to 150,000 milligrams of vitamin C daily all right often
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:00.980]   intravenously right and then and then base and but when he himself and you saw
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:06.540]   had pneumonia remember remember what's killing people it he took it took him
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:12.620]   2,000 milligrams of vitamin C every six minutes by the clock to get me to
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:21.220]   saturation his daily dose to to when he personally took vitamin C for pneumonia
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:27.100]   was a over a hundred thousand milligrams a day his fever his cough and other
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:34.460]   symptoms were reduced in hours complete recovery just took a few days so what
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.740]   I would like to propose to everyone who's watching this is albeit that the
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:44.820]   Chinese are doing a clinical trial at 24,000 milligrams per day IV translates
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:50.940]   to 2.4 to 4.8 ounces of liposomal vitamin C per day I would say the air on
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.540]   the side of caution to air on the side of being conservative I don't think you
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.860]   could throw enough at this thing you know if coronavirus were to hit my loved
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:03.100]   ones I'm not gonna you know I would just literally do as much as I could so I
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.180]   personally after reading this would like to just suggest and this is an
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:11.580]   estimate again that if you took these numbers here it converts to 16,000 to
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:17.580]   30,000 milligrams of vitamin C per day and in a lipoform you're looking at 16
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:22.460]   to 30 ounces of liposomal vitamin C per day that you would be drinking if you
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.620]   were to take these numbers and say okay well how do I convert that to liposomal
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.740]   vitamin C and how much would I need to drink right and this is what it comes
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:36.100]   down to so there's a couple of ranges it's not an exact science the Chinese are
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.620]   doing 24,000 this way but it'd be if we if you know if you were doing it at home
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.940]   because we are you know we are mere peasants we can't get we don't have
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.300]   access to IVs and if there was a massive outbreak in your city I doubt you could
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:51.740]   even get into a hospital right so if you're gonna try to do this at home you
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.740]   could either follow what the trial is doing and maybe drink you know on the
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:00.180]   conservative side five ounces a day or you could go super conservative and or
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:04.260]   or I'm sure I guess the other actually it's aggressive right or you get
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.060]   aggressive and you can go 30 ounces a day but that's the range okay because
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.540]   there this is not an exact science it hasn't been proven yeah what it does I
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:16.300]   mean we haven't they haven't learned what it does against coronavirus but as I
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.260]   showed you and that just that one slide and if you watch that to our lecture
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:25.500]   you will see that it is it nails hepatitis it nails polio it nails all
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:30.140]   sorts of infectious diseases and that is what coronavirus is but right now
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.660]   nobody knows what that number is and these are the data points that I've been
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.860]   able to collect to kind of guess at what that number is all right so going
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.380]   forward in this video I want to just let you know I'm focused on this number
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.260]   here I'd rather take the higher number than the lower number you want to be
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.260]   aggressive about this and this is the number I'll be basing the rest of the
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:53.580]   numbers off of okay so taking that number and if you had to let's say stock
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.260]   up a bit because you want to make sure you're prepared for this to be able to
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:01.820]   self-treated home because we're gonna get quarantined if this happens if you
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.460]   need to self-treat how much do you need so what would be your burn rate how fast
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.460]   would you be burning through the supplies and now I'm gonna make a couple
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:11.940]   of assumptions right in order to calculate these numbers the assumption
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:16.740]   the first assumption I want to make is that one quote treatment is daily for
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:22.140]   14 days and and again I'm being aggressive and you saw said that he was
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.380]   completely cured from pneumonia in seven days I've also read other articles that
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.220]   are saying that the reinfection rate is critical that you would need to
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:34.060]   completely nail it like like taking antibiotics you have to do the full
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:38.100]   regimen you can't just take half the bottle or it comes back worse that's
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:42.140]   what your doctor always tells you right so in my mind it's like hey if if Andrew
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:46.300]   saws seven days for pneumonia I'm gonna double that to 14 that is my
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.620]   assumption I'm gonna throw everything I got at it I'm just gonna hit it hard
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:53.980]   14 days I'm gonna do twice as long and I'm gonna take the highest dose between
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:59.140]   16 to 30 and you know what Andrew saws a grown man so it would be different for
[00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:04.020]   women different for children so forth so those are the assumption I made in with
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.580]   these numbers I'll just you know I won't walk you through specific numbers but
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.660]   with the vitamin C one tablespoon he goes 12 grams so it's basically one
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.900]   gram per ounce you apply these numbers to it and you're gonna burn you're
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:20.180]   gonna need anywhere from a half to a full pound per day I'm sorry not per day
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.460]   per person and then the amount of lethicin you would need because remember
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:28.820]   now the lethicin it's it's one tablespoon to make 12 ounces of liposomal but
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.220]   with lethicin you need three tablespoons for the same 12 ounces right it all
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:37.540]   goes into into the mix together and those three tablespoons weighs 30 grams I
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:42.260]   waited this morning so it's 30 grams of lethicin 12 grams of vitamin C will
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:46.340]   make you that 12 ounces of liposomal and the water right which comes out this
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:51.100]   so the lethicin comes out to 2.5 grams per ounce you apply these ratios and you
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:57.860]   get 1.23 to 2.3 pounds per person and a person is 14 days so that's what this
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.580]   looks like right here so if you were gonna stock up you need to think all
[00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:07.020]   right well if everybody in my family if I have four people right let's say like
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:10.460]   for me I have three right so I have three humans and so the three of us are
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:15.700]   gonna need one set of this each if I were to self-treat at home so I would
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:20.980]   need you know six pounds of lethicin and three pounds of vitamin C to do one
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.460]   treatment for all three of us and you know in the event of reinfection I
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.940]   probably want more than that that's all up to you but that's what I'm doing so
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:33.260]   I'm doing I'm essentially preparing for two treatments per person in my in my
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.140]   family to have that much stock on hand and to be ready for this should it
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:43.100]   happen and if you've read the news Hawaii is one of the seven cities that's
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:48.340]   still accepting flights from China so so that's kind of where my brains at right
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:52.060]   now you can try to imagine okay so that's what the burn rate would be that's
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:55.700]   how much you need to stock the one thing I don't have a slide for is okay let's
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:59.700]   say you make a whole bunch of it right in at one time you don't want to make it
[00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:03.460]   a little bit at a time how long will it store and you know what I've made this
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.860]   and I've stored it into my by the way I've been making liposomal vitamin C for
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:12.740]   a long time and I discovered that I could make a big batch of it like a
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.580]   gallon stick it in the fridge and it's gonna be good for months and months and
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:21.340]   months it's it's basically fat you know and so it's just the same thing is like
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.180]   you know your milk goes bad but life will some of vitamin C doesn't go bad
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.580]   because it's got this vitamin C in it vitamin C's water it's an it's an
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:31.860]   antioxidants or you know so it did unless it gets completely oxidized you'll be
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.300]   fine but I wouldn't go more than let's say six months just to be on the safe
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.240]   side I don't know what the number is I'm guessing but I just you know I just
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:41.240]   from experience okay so that's what I would say so yeah you'd want to make a
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.660]   big batch but you know it's not gonna store forever nothing does right well
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:49.140]   I'm sorry some things do but we'll we'll go there all right that's that so now
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:54.140]   how do you make liposomal vitamin C I kind of touched on this in the Bob Beck
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:58.940]   protocol video let me walk you through the actual specifics the first thing you
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.500]   need is your materials obviously you need vitamin C which is a ceramic acid
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:08.100]   you need sunflower lethisen you know I don't do not use soy lethisen it for a
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.780]   whole lot of reasons just sunflower lethisen or and then you want to use
[00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.060]   distilled water or you could use filtered water but I use distilled water this is
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:20.140]   what I do okay now the equipment there's it's optional I this is the thing I did
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:24.220]   a video I'm going to show you here where I decided to do it the traditional way
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:28.500]   and I tried to tinker with two different ways to do it sorry I'm a tinker I just
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.220]   have to tinker so I tried two different ways three different ways you could do
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.780]   it to show you what it looks like you could do three different ways so I used
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:39.540]   a blender just the blender I use an ultrasonic cleaner and I use the magnetic
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.700]   stirred kind of see what the you know what the difference would be so you can
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.060]   pick any one of these three whatever makes you happy all right to make liposomal
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.740]   vitamin C now the formula is very simple it's one tablespoon of a
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:55.620]   sorbric acid of the vitamin C in four ounces of water three tablespoons of
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:28:00.260]   lethisen in eight ounces of water you dissolve them separately so in one
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.900]   container you dissolve the lethisen and that's the blender I'll show you why
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:08.220]   you need a blender for that and then you have to in a separate cup you dissolve
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.380]   the sorbric acid in a in water you have so you have two different solutions right
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:18.300]   and then you mix them together and then you with using a blender a cleaner or
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.620]   stir that's these are the three ways you could mix the two solutions you got
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:27.900]   two cups of things you put them together blender cleaner stir okay that's it so
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.180]   let me walk you through the costs because that's I know everybody always goes
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:37.140]   well what's this cost if you bought per person for the supplies okay a total of
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:40.580]   forty one dollars and thirty eight cents per person you need one pound right and
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:45.300]   two pounds and you'd have this is right now links in the video description just
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.900]   an estimate you know if you were to buy those brands that quantity if you bought
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:54.780]   bigger quantities way cheaper all right so the most it would cost you is forty
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:59.340]   one thirty eight per person and then of course the equipment depending on what
[00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:04.020]   equipment you want to use these are the basic prices for the cleaner the mixer
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:08.260]   and and the magnetic stir now the one thing about the magnetic stir is this is
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:13.820]   a good enough price for a good enough magnetic stir for the average human the
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:19.180]   one I'm showing in the video is is is way overkill for you if you're just you
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:24.260]   know if you're not because I use magnetic stirs all the time because I make my C 60
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:28.860]   oil so I've got a very expensive very fancy one so don't recommend that I'm
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:33.020]   just telling you get it simple cheaper one okay all right so whoops I'm not
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:37.580]   there yet so let me go ahead and jump into the video and walk you through how
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:42.140]   to make it so here's the how to part so in this part right here this is your
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:48.260]   typical sunflower lethicin ascorbic acid vitamin C okay now I'm just using up
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.380]   some I bought a bunch of this stuff but I'm using up some supplies so in this
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:59.180]   video I'm using phospholated cloned cloned cloned cloned sorry and it's it's
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:03.500]   it's it is a it is a lethicin but it's a it's an extract of a of lethicin and
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:07.780]   it's a much higher concentrate I'm just using up supplies all right if you're
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:12.460]   gonna make your own just do it this way but in the video I am just using up
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:16.340]   supplies because these are this is older so I've got a jar full of sodium
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:20.420]   sorbet which is vitamin C and I've got this and I just that's just what I used
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.380]   okay but and I just wanted to point that out that you know normally this I got a
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.180]   whole bunch of that stuff but I'm just using up some old stuff and this is what
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:31.980]   I use in the video okay so now these are the this is equipment you need you're
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:36.020]   gonna need a little cup and a spoon something to put it in your water the
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.660]   little blender and then of course the ultrasonic cleaner what's not pictured
[00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:44.380]   here is a it's a measuring spoon okay but you need a tablespoon to measure out
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.860]   everything with and then and you first thing you do is you want to heat the
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.540]   water you want to heat the water and and you know I do it by touch and so I put
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.820]   my finger you know I basically if I can put my finger in there and it's hot but
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.820]   not where I you know I have to pull it out that's good enough and that's where
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.540]   you want it you don't want to make it too hot you don't want to boil it so I
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:04.420]   just I just heat it up and in my little hot pot and I heat up the water and
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.260]   then just so you know like I said and so I'm guessing it's like about a hundred
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.820]   and five hundred ten and that's it so not too hot okay so you just want to warm
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:16.460]   up the water because the warmer it is the easier things dissolve now what this
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:21.700]   demonstration right here is is that if you just try to add the lethosin to warm
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:27.460]   water okay it doesn't dissolve so and it's just gonna clump up so you really
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.860]   need that you'd have to have a blender for this alright so look at look at this
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:34.940]   right as if you just try to stir it up like that it just clumps up and it will
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:40.260]   not dissolve and you need it to dissolve so instead you have to basically put it
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:45.540]   in a blender so that's your eight ounces of water right I'm three tablespoons
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:50.300]   plus eight ounces of water sorry this is incorrect I'm sorry sorry sorry I just
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.220]   realize that now so that's three tablespoons with eight ounces of water
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:58.380]   total of twelve when you're done okay you put it in the blender and this is
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.500]   what it looks like it's very foamy but don't worry about it okay so that's
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.260]   just the lethosin and the eight ounces of water it's very sorry about the typo
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.300]   so then the next thing you want to do is you want to dissolve the vitamin C so
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:14.060]   in order to develop dissolve the vitamin C it's four ounces of water it's warm
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:20.820]   water one tablespoon of vitamin C powder in the four ounces luckily I got the
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:24.020]   number right on this slide and then you just mix it up with a spoon and it
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:28.260]   really dissolves very very quickly so you let it dissolve and now you've got
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:32.340]   your second container right you've got one container of lethosin dissolved and
[00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:37.220]   one container of vitamin C dissolved and you got the two separate alright so the
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.380]   next thing you want to do is you have this is your three options again so you
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:44.140]   want to mix them together now at this point so you can use either use a blender
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:49.580]   a cleaner or stir so here's the thing I'm not I didn't video me blending for
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:53.020]   90 seconds because that's kind of like you know it's like okay you get it right
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:57.740]   so you could either use the blender and I just did it for 90 seconds on low I
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:02.540]   just held my finger on it and just let it go for 90 seconds and that's batch one
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:07.020]   the second batch is coming up and this is how you would do it now the how you
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.380]   do it with ultrasonic cleaners is actually the traditional way it's the
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:15.380]   way that most people do it from the old days right and so you just pour the
[00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:20.100]   vitamin C mixture in first then you pour the lethosin mixture in there next and
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:24.180]   then you get a spoon you stir it up a bit I'm talking faster than the videos
[00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:28.900]   going there you go and then you just stir it up that's it and you turn the
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:34.180]   thing on for eight minutes 48 480 seconds you turn it on and it's going to just
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.900]   vibrate and it's going to mix up everything together with ultrasonic
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:42.340]   waves and boom you've got that's your that's your that's your solution the
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.340]   third way is using a magnetic stir so if you have one this is a little bit
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:49.580]   fancy and if you do have one of these things make sure you set the hot I just
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:53.140]   wanted to keep it warm while I was doing because it's been cold lately so I just
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.460]   turn it at the 40 degrees centigrade which is like 105 Fahrenheit and then I
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:03.980]   set the what let me show you let me just go okay so then I didn't okay all
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:10.060]   right too many buttons okay so I I did set it initially at 700 RPM so then my
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:14.740]   point right here is set to set the stir to 500 if you can set it but the point
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:18.820]   that's this this makes if you don't have dials is that you don't want to spin it
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.820]   too fast because I made a mistake where this thing was spinning too fast I
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:25.860]   didn't know because of the foam right because I couldn't see the top of the
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.940]   liquid I only can see the foam I didn't know that the thing had a really deep
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:32.940]   vortex about about an inch and a half down and so the heat probe was sticking
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.980]   into the middle of the vortex and what's the vortex it's just air and so the
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:41.020]   probe was was not able to measure the temperature and this then the hot plate
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.940]   on my stir got really hot when I finally noticed what was going on I had
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:49.500]   actually burnt the liposomal vitamin C so here's a picture just to show you
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:53.340]   that what happens if you burn this thing if you if you if your waters too
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:57.540]   hot you're gonna burn it and it's gonna look like this this is blender this is
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:02.220]   sonicator this is burnt okay so I threw this out but let me you look how much
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:07.320]   volume it lost it got really dense and very gross so don't burn your liposomal
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.300]   vitamin C and that's the you know so it learned from my mistakes but that's how
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:18.020]   we learn right so now so then I tried it again and and and I put it in the
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:22.100]   stir I like stirred it overnight and I let it sit for 24 hours I let it sit
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.740]   overnight because I wanted to test I wanted to take a look from a
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.620]   comparative standpoint is what's the difference between the three different
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:33.060]   ways of making it so the very first one is saturation this is saturation
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:38.100]   meaning how much of the vitamin C actually saturated into the solution with
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.260]   the lethosin and that and that means how many you know did it turn into liposomes
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:46.620]   because anything that doesn't turn into liposomes will settle to the bottom
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.860]   okay if it's not if it hasn't been turned into liposomes it'll just be this
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:56.140]   film on the very bottom that's exactly how C 60 oil works right and so this is
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:01.420]   the bottom of the jar from the using the blender so you can kind of see that
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:07.220]   there is a very thin film after 24 hours of of what would essentially be
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:12.380]   vitamin C so it did absorb the majority of the vitamin C and there's a very
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:16.900]   thin film that settled out so one of the and this happens with every time I've
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.460]   ever made it this is what happens so the idea of those if you let it sit for a
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:24.980]   little while before you take it just shake the jar it's as simple as that but
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.220]   there will be some residual and this is what it looks like when you use a
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:33.220]   blender okay and so now let's take a look at the next one which is how much
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:38.340]   residual vitamin C is left when you use the sonicator so that was the blender
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:43.340]   this is what it looks like when you use a sonicator so I couldn't honestly I
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.540]   couldn't tell the difference it was like you know because I never really tried
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.660]   the blender before so I you know so just using I always use the sonicator
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:53.260]   because that's just how everybody does it but hey look at that it looks the same
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:57.340]   so now check it out check out the mixer so this is where I use the stir I use
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:02.140]   after 24 hours the magnetic stir letting it settle and look at that it looks
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:07.480]   exactly the same if anything if you were just to stop right right here back up a
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.660]   sec look at that's magnificent I think this is look it looks thicker than the
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:16.220]   other two so it's kind of like I'm trying to eyeball this thing but at the end of
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:21.740]   the day I think that the magnetic stir didn't do as good as job as the other
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:25.340]   two and the other two were pretty much even right so so you know
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.420]   recommendation you guys are looking at the evidence but you know you can go
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:32.020]   blender or cleaner and then you're everyone's thinking right now like why
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:36.220]   would I buy a cleaner if the blender does a great job there you go okay so
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.580]   that's kind of why I tried all three this is with my tink I have to do a tink
