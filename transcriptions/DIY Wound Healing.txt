[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.960]   Kilmer and in this video I'd like to share with you my take on DIY wound
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:16.140]   healing and specifically a case study of a recent dog bite a pretty serious one
[00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:22.440]   that my daughter had on her hand and how we went about healing her wound without
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.880]   the intervention of you know visits to the ER physicians or antibiotics and
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.920]   that sort of thing and so you know just to show that it's completely possible
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.320]   to do so without having to risk your gut microbiome with antibiotics and or
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.880]   incurring all of the discomfort of having to deal with the modern health
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.160]   care system so but before I get into that case study and if this is for you if
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.320]   you're interested in that sort of thing being self-sufficient and being
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.860]   prepared for it I want to just do a little disclaimer that this is not
[00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:01.480]   medical advice this is my story our story and I also want to really strongly
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.860]   caution everybody when it comes to dog bites if there's any concern at all
[00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.540]   that the dog that bit someone or bit you could have had rabies then that person
[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.260]   needs to get a rabies vaccine series immediately okay the the vaccines can
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.540]   prevent rabies but otherwise getting rabies is almost a certain death for you
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.660]   if the dog has it and so luckily in most situations people will know the dog
[00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.240]   that bit them the dog can then they will know whether the dog was vaccinated or
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.220]   not legally the dog would have to be quarantined for a couple of weeks in the
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.820]   case of my daughter the dog was known the dog had been vaccinated and so she
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.380]   was just well we treated her wound as a typical wound otherwise she would have
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.700]   to go get the rabies shots and so now if it's a loose animal and you don't know
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.660]   the dog you can't find the owner and that has happened to me and it just
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.900]   happened to a friend of mine just last week where he got bit riding his bicycle
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.300]   and he's undergoing rabies shots right now because he can't find the dog but
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.180]   you know usually animal control will find try to find the animal and you know
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.140]   they usually get put down if they have rabies and they you know that's kind of
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.620]   a brutal process but the bottom line though is it's a very serious issue when you
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.100]   get bit by an animal for the fact of the issue with rabies okay so take that
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.660]   very seriously but in this case I want to caveat that you know we chose as two
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.940]   adults my daughter is an adult to undergo do you know DIY you know a self-
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.180]   treatment you know and instead of going to a modern medicine you know practice
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.940]   process okay and then so our process here and and I just before I you know get
[00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.100]   into the what we did and how do you do it is you know trying to understand you
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.260]   know why why even do it yourself anyway so you know first of all where
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.980]   there's no doctor okay so there's a lot of situations where you know this is
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.900]   actually really good information to have if you're somewhere where there's just
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.380]   no doctor and I was raised by two very self-sufficient individuals who were
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.420]   raised in environments where their doctors were just not available father
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.740]   group on a farm my mother grew up in World War II and post World War II
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.460]   Taiwan and so in these environments you know just medical care was just not
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.340]   available also you know my father was an avid outdoors man I spent literally
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.220]   half of my entire childhood in the woods or on a boat and as things happened and
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.100]   they always do and I can tell you a countless number of times my sister and
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.140]   I got injured or something happened you know we just took care of ourselves you
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.220]   know our parents took care of us I learned from them also a lifelong scout
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.380]   and you know the motto of the boy scouts is always be prepared and that kind of
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.580]   morphed into being a preparedness individual and adulthood and so I've
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.140]   always really pride myself on being self-sufficient so I will always lean
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.660]   towards taking care of myself before I go out and seek the assistance of others
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.900]   if I know I can take care of it and that comes from experience and that comes
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.500]   from education which is what this video is you know kind of meant to do and so I
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.420]   pass that on to my daughter as well and she's actually a veterinarian student
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.140]   you know and so she's typically you know you know she's actually technically
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.860]   an allopath herself but she also knows that the number other the number two
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.100]   other reason about protecting your gut microbiome I mean she's aware of it I'm
[00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.980]   aware of it and I want to mention this for those of you who aren't really attuned
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:37.860]   to what antibiotics you know will do for you and also do to you and it's
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.580]   basically a shotgun blast your gut microbiome and your your gut is where
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.660]   all of these beneficial symbiotic bacterium live with live within you that
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.980]   are part of your process for digestion and health your immune system and so
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.220]   forth so there's this really important colony of stuff that lives inside of you
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.900]   that is critical for your health and it's really it really is the backbone of
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.920]   your immune system and when you take antibiotics you destroy different
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.780]   cultures of bacterium that could take up to two years to recover from just one
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.340]   round of antibiotics and you will have all sorts of issues from that there's a
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.940]   lot of side effects as as any other pharmaceutical you know that you are
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.020]   prescribed look at the back three pages of the document that comes with it and
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.460]   it's nothing but side effects and if you're someone like myself and and also my
[00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.220]   daughter you don't want to do that to yourself you know it's kind of a
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.020]   drastic you know measure to take when you could do something else that won't
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.300]   destroy your gut microbiome then you know that's just the way that my family
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.140]   rolls the third reason is you're me you know I just like I just described
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.140]   myself and on top of all everything I just said I personally really don't like
[00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.900]   the entire quote modern medicine you know they're called alipas and they've
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.100]   only been doing their thing for about a hundred years whereas you know when you
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.340]   look at the other traditional healing arts, Ayurvedic Chinese traditional medicine
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.540]   blah blah you know they've been around for thousands of years you know and so I
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.580]   just don't trust it you know that's my opinion I but I just don't and I just
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.580]   think the taking the path of using synthetic chemicals to try to you know
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.540]   and quote improve your health is sort of a you know it's just an oxymoron to me
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.980]   that that would be the route anyone would take but that is the DIY reason for you
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.660]   know the way that I approach things the way my family approaches it so now when
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:46.020]   it comes to a you know DIY wound healing and this is from myself my family my
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.540]   process that I go through it's it's a four-point strategy and I think that's
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:56.140]   something that everyone you know honestly you don't even find this in
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.780]   modern medicine but you know because typically though modern medicine is and
[00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.940]   I've gotten dog bites and they will basically do one and two and so they
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.860]   don't think about three and four but it's a four-step process if you really you
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.740]   know and I'm kind of good at it I've been doing it for a couple of decades now
[00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.620]   and I've gotten some serious accidents and and this dog bite situation is just
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.100]   one of those situations where my daughter at this time it was her time
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.340]   her turn you know to have an accident but bottom line though is you know they
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.140]   if you go to a you know the ER they're gonna flush the dog bite one of the
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.940]   really bad things about dog bites as opposed to getting cut is that you know
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.340]   the dog's fangs will penetrate deep into your tissues not just your skin and
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.020]   and all that bacteria will go deep into your muscle and into the into your
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.340]   flesh and it's really hard you know once that bacteria gets in there you're
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.220]   guaranteed gonna have an infection her bite was significant I'll show you
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.820]   pictures here in a second and so you know there's a the issue here is you've
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.740]   got two two avenues of infection you need to be concerned about with this
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.380]   type of a wound and first of all it's the topical it's that very top layer of
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:08.220]   your dermis and your epidermal layer of your skin that's been broken and you're
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.580]   definitely I mean you a guaranteed will get an infection as much as you can
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.780]   flush the wound and everything like that you're gonna get an infection from a
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:21.380]   topical standpoint your skin turns red bright red inflammation swelling that
[00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.620]   sort of thing and then the second thing also because the bacteria has
[00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.780]   penetrated into your meat yeah then you're basically getting also gonna get it
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.020]   an internal infection and you'll see this infection go up your arm and then
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.340]   you know other people untreated you know it turns into sepsis and and so forth
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.420]   and so it can get extremely dangerous infection literally is if you if you
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.460]   study you know you know like I'm a civil war buff and one of the biggest
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:52.180]   things during the civil war and more more soldiers died from infections than
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.260]   they died from the actual wounds that they got you know if you study if you if
[00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.860]   you study that and that that's typical for all all you know all wounds of that
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:06.860]   nature so infections are the worst part about wounds and so the approach that I
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:13.380]   take on a DIY effort to heal a wound is to treat that topical one way and an
[00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.940]   internal another way also to keep in mind that there's an there's the concept of
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:23.220]   bioelectricity we are electrical beings our processes everything about our
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:27.140]   cells you know through this thing called a potassium ion you know potassium
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:31.860]   calcium ion exchange we're we're literally electrical beings we have a
[00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:37.180]   current that runs about I think it's like 21 milliamps in ourselves that's our
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.380]   typical voltage we you know have electricity going through us and our
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:46.220]   bodies once that electricity is broken because there's an opening in the in the
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.860]   body then if that electricity doesn't flow correctly then you know if you can
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:55.220]   establish that electricity and you can and you can basically put electricity
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:00.940]   back into the body and to basically help that wound then I you know studies show
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.820]   that you know that it actually does help heal and improve wound healing and also
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.340]   the nutrients you know slowly we'll get into that more deeply so right off the
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:14.060]   bat on the topical infection part this is what we did now the initial flush
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.380]   obviously is the only people want to do this once it's hydrogen peroxide to
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.260]   basically get the majority of whatever contaminants made it into the wound and
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.300]   so there's an initial flush of hydrogen peroxide to do that which is
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.900]   essentially just blasting it with oxygen and you don't really want to do
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.860]   that twice because it's damaging it will eat up everything you know and so you
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:40.260]   only do it once it's not something you want to do you know day two day three so
[00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.780]   there's that initial flush and then what was interesting about this time it was
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:49.300]   normally you know when like I have a wound or something like that then I will
[00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.700]   just treat it with C60 oil which is has a wound healing properties if you you
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.780]   know you can go do that there's studies on that already as well as
[00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:02.060]   clodal silver which is anti bacterial and try anti microbial and I use those two
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:07.260]   compounds and I usually that's usually good enough I've also used ozonation on
[00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.100]   other wounds others another video in my series where I got bit by a spider it
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.220]   was turned into a really bad abscess and I use that as a case study for wound
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:21.220]   healing as well where I was able to successfully ozonate and and do blood
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.660]   electrification but in this case you know the first few days I was telling her
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:30.740]   you know try C60 and clodal silver and it wasn't really making enough you know
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.660]   making the effect that we were looking for in terms of just the you know
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:41.380]   watching the skin coloration and as it as a determination for infection so she
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:45.580]   switched to then using betadine which was the only you know like kind of
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.740]   medical supply that was used during this and in addition to the gauze and so
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.380]   forth so she switched to a betadine aniseptic which is based in which iodine
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:00.540]   based solution to basically disinfect the wound topically and then for an
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.940]   ointment instead of using antibiotic cream you know she was using manuka
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.540]   honey ointment this is medical manuka honey and if you if you studied honeys
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:15.340]   there's this magical honey from Australia called manuka and you know I
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.580]   actually take it when like if I ever got a sore throat or anything like that and
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.700]   she does as well so these two the two products of course there's links to
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.820]   everything I'm going to be talking about in the video description below but
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.220]   these were the two things that did work and so I you know so I'm just saying
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.460]   that you know when I think that just as now discovered with this case that we
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:39.900]   just did on her hand we discovered that when it's really severe you know just
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:44.020]   C60 oil and clodal silver and ozonation it's just not good enough not strong
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:51.660]   enough but betadine worked wonderfully as well as the manuka honey ointment on
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.420]   the wound itself after it was disinfected and doing that was just was it just
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.100]   worked out perfectly and you'll see in the pictures how well the wound healed
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.620]   now in terms of bandaging obviously one of the things about wounds is that
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.980]   they're going to seep and you want to let them breathe and so just a loose
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:14.020]   gauze bandage and then change daily in fact you know I went you know one one
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.580]   time I had a dog bite and same thing you know I thought they were gonna stitch
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.140]   me up and like no we don't want to stitch you up because we with this thing
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.940]   it needs to it needs to seep out you know it's gonna it's gonna just seep and
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.260]   you need to let it seep if you seal it up you're gonna trap all that all that
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.260]   inside of you and you don't want to that's gonna make your infection worse so so
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.220]   that's kind of what did she didn't get any stitches obviously we never she
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.780]   never went to the doctor and so basically just treating it with and from a topical
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:45.180]   treating it with betadine and manuka medical honey did really really good
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:50.980]   job on the topical infection aspect of the wound now the next thing from an
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.860]   internal standpoint this is where the doctors will just you know give you
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:59.700]   prescriptions of antibiotics and you'll do a 10-day regimen and of course you know
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.860]   all the side effects that come with that and so to avoid that you know the
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.860]   process that my family does is they will we all do the Bob Beck protocol now I
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.300]   made an entire video link below in the description in the video description of
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:20.500]   that video but a Bob Beck protocol is based on you know the basic modality is
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:25.100]   blood electrification and in the video it kind of describes the patents and the
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.100]   studies that created you know the the whole idea of doing it and all you know
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.420]   that stuff so I covered that in the video but the idea though is you want to
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:37.100]   basically use a device that will base you know that sends a microcurrent through
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.740]   your bloodstream which then basically mitigates and or neutralizes all the
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.680]   pathogens in your bloods viruses bacteriums molds fungus anything that's a
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.300]   pathogen so a wipe out any type of infection that you have that's made it
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:54.620]   to your bloodstream and so the Beck protocol is a combination of blood
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.780]   electrification and then ingesting clodal silver you know which is water
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:03.780]   silver ions suspended in water as well as a water that has been ozinated which
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:08.980]   is gives it you know basically you're taking in a big blast of oxygen in the
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:14.540]   water you're drinking silver ions oxygen by itself is an incredible anti my
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:19.400]   cry my crowbarrow again so clodal silver is an anti my crowbarrow my
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:24.500]   crowbarrel sorry and then the blood electrification you know basically
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.980]   banging away and and you know mitigating all those pathogens so those that
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:34.100]   combination of things is called the Bob Beck protocol again watch the video
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.740]   but doing that Bob Beck protocol for the moment that she had a dog bite she
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.300]   started the Bob Beck protocol and she did it for seven days straight and that
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:47.460]   prevented any internal infection whatsoever so in place of antibiotics
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.780]   this is what was done so that she did not have to destroy her gut micro you know
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:56.860]   her gut microbiome and you know and when she was done with wound healing she's
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.340]   you know perfectly healthy and no side effects and that's the whole key to
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.300]   this right so again you know you want to hit it really hard with from the top
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.260]   topical aspect of it and you want to hit that infection really hard from
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:14.160]   internal and this is how how we did it now the next thing again about micro
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.500]   current and this is a wound healing support processes but I want to kind of
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.980]   point you to a study and just a sample of multiple different studies on the
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.260]   subject link in the description below but this study specifically about home
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.020]   based electrical stimulation to accelerate wound healing as a double
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.260]   blind randomized control our trial so you know this is very you know this is
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:39.260]   all real you know NIH level type of studies but bottom line here's a study
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.180]   that basically demonstrates that using a micro current device and in this case
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:47.500]   this micro current current device is called a tenant bio modulator I have one
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.820]   also have I have all this stuff I've been doing this for a couple decades my
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.620]   daughter has all of you know everything we both have these med kids with with
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:59.020]   all these tools in it and that allows us to be DIY and I admit that you have to
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.780]   have that as well if you want to be DIY but you know if you want to avoid
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:08.420]   alipas and you do need to prepare and have these things on hand and they
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:13.100]   work that's the key they work okay and so bottom line though this is an entire
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:18.340]   study you know it's ten pages long that kind of describes describes all of the
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.460]   different processes by which they use micro current to stimulate the body's
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:27.660]   ability to heal itself and to accelerate wound healing so micro current as a
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:32.700]   treatment for wound healing to help your body heal itself and put your
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:38.140]   body into a healing state is proven and it worked really really well and it was
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.620]   just you know in other words you've got to deal with the infection but you also
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:44.780]   want to help the wound heal right so it's kind of a you know a two-step
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:50.500]   process so fighting off the infection step one step two is help your body
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.140]   heal and the number one way you can help your body heal is through micro
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.580]   current now the other way you can help your body heal is through nutrients and
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:02.620]   here's another study link link below where I also want to really caveat the
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.940]   concept here you know it's kind of like when you've got a wound your body has
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.740]   to create all of the tissues and regrow regenerate all of the connective
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:15.620]   tissues all of the you know blood the blood vessels and everything else that's
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:21.460]   been destroyed in the wound it has to grow it's it's not any different then
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:25.540]   you know it's a woman getting pregnant and being prescribed prenatal vitamins
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.500]   and the whole idea here is if you were to take a look at this study where it
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:34.200]   basically demonstrates that the necessity and the importance of actually having
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.740]   nutritional support for connective tissue repair and wound healing and it
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:44.020]   gets into the actual detail of what types of nutrition is critical for your
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:48.820]   body to replace all of the tissues that were damaged and to regenerate and regrow
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:55.700]   everything collagen, glucosamine, gluconic acids, amino acids, vitamin E, zinc and
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:00.300]   copper all of the different things that your body is going to pull out of your
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.580]   system to then grow all these new tissues right and I'll tell you what if
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:09.300]   you are mineral deficient if you are vitamin deficient and you get a wound
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.180]   you're screwed because where's your body gonna get all of these building
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.900]   materials to replace all that stuff that got damaged and so one of the first
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.580]   things we did obviously you know we did a bunch of things real quick but right
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.860]   off the bat was like hey man let's let's get this thing cleaned up let's get
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:29.860]   treated immediately started the Bob Beck protocol another thing was between the
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.060]   Bob Beck protocol I was having her zap with the microcurrent device the you know
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.280]   the biomodulator to stimulate the body's healing process while she was fighting
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.460]   off the infection you know treating it topically and lastly though I basically
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.260]   told her hey you know you need to double up on all these different
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.940]   supplements and so you know I brought a bunch to her as well she had some but
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.140]   basically making her making her you know making sure that she was doubling up
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.140]   not just your daily vitamin you need to double it right because your body is
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:04.100]   going to need your quote daily but then you need even more right to regenerate
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.900]   all these tissues so and then basic you know basically doubled up on these
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.740]   specific supplements so that she was aiding her body and giving her body the
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:16.180]   basic building blocks that she needed to replace all of those tissues and so I
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:21.340]   want to show you what this was this was the dog bite this was this she had
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:25.180]   multiple aspirations on the top of her hand that were superficial in nature
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:29.500]   this one big gash right here but then this was the worst of it was her pinky
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.460]   it was just you could see this incredible gash all the way down to the bone
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:36.740]   initially this was like I think day three or something like that we tried to
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.300]   take pictures as much as we could during this but you know you can imagine
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:45.660]   right so the wound was pretty up was very deep and it was pretty big gash it
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:50.860]   wasn't just a you know just a cut it this was a gash the dog did quite a
[00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.620]   number on her hand and so this was in the early a few days after a few days
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.580]   of treatment you can see where the wounds had started to patch together and the
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:05.100]   coloration which is really important here instead of it turning red it stayed
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.740]   just this nice flesh tone which meant that you know we were on top of the
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.060]   infection from from the topical standpoint the yellow colorations from
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.460]   the bed of dying by the way and so basically the wound started to heal
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:20.860]   really well this is about a week or so into it and then another week or so
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:25.900]   after that the healing continued to progress at a really great rate and
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:29.540]   there was just a little bit of redness because she had to go to work and use
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:34.980]   her hands and so as much as she tried not to you know damage the you know the
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.900]   wound itself because you know you're trying to let it heal and don't want to
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.700]   disturb the scabbing you know she did kind of disturb it so it was getting a
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.900]   little red about three weeks in there but she just kept up the same protocol as
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.340]   described and so then about about a month later you know it really
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.340]   scabbed over really well the top lacerations on the top of her hand it healed
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.900]   pretty pretty well at that point and so at this point these gashes had become
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.820]   rather superficial they you know the the deeper part had healed up and covered
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:07.580]   up and most recently you know then this was about six weeks into it where you
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:10.780]   could see where this one wounded completely healed and then the the gash
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:14.700]   is pretty much completely sealed at that point and then lastly at two months
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.700]   this is what her hand looks like so just to kind of give you an example she did
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.780]   have a she does now I mean this is permanent a little bit of a scar right
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.620]   there a couple of scars on the top of her hand and then right here you could see
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.820]   where the gash was and it took out all this skin and this is the part you know
[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.820]   this is all of this had to be regrown and so that kind of really exemplifies the
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.740]   concept here that you're gonna have to create new tissue and you know and the
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.820]   the need for you know for building you know for the nutrient building blocks
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:45.740]   but just to also point out too you know it was kind of difficult because the
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:50.740]   wound location so just in using the microcurrent device I basically was
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:55.620]   saying hey you know put the put the probe here and here you know so she was
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.940]   then probing at the tip of her finger as well to draw blood flow into the finger
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.500]   as well as putting the microcurrent device here and you know we call it
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.220]   zapping but it's not it's just basically you're putting the probe up there and
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:11.540]   letting the the microcurrent send current into the into the into the wound area
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.580]   and so she did that I believe it was like about I thought I was telling her
[00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:20.580]   like you know do it 15 minutes a day of the microcurrent and and change the
[00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.580]   bandage daily and you know she was on board with this very smart girl but you
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:30.380]   can see where you know the wound head healed perfectly I mean you know there's
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.380]   gonna be a scar no matter what and even if you stitch it up you'd still have a
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:39.180]   scar so bottom line at the end of the day this is a do-it-yourself wound
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:45.340]   healing without the necessity to destroy your gut microbiome and have side
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:49.580]   effects weeks into months later because of what you've done to your digestive
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:56.820]   system and basically the also the idea of that that it is 100% possible to be
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:01.180]   your own healer and to you know and to support yourself and if you're someone
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:05.540]   like a Mariner and you're out on a boat or you're a hunter camper and there's
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:10.300]   just no doctor around you know having a blood electrification little just a little
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:16.140]   box it's a little tiny thing to carry with you and a couple of these you know
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.220]   these these you know these you know these I get them better diners you know
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.900]   money honey but just having some supplies you know like whenever I go and
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.660]   I'm not anywhere near civilization I have this I have a little kit and I carry
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.500]   this stuff around because you never know what's gonna happen so that's the
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.420]   other point to even even if you're not you know opposed to alipaz you still
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:38.420]   should be prepared you never know what could happen but anyway this video are
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.820]   trying to keep it as short as possible I just wanted to share with you the
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:46.220]   story and the way that we did it and how we did it and the success of it as a
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:53.180]   demonstration that you can completely heal thyself you know doctor thyself be
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:58.220]   your own healer and you don't need chemicals and synthetic chemicals to do
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:03.060]   so you can treat yourself and come out perfectly fine you just need the
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:07.780]   confidence to do so and you need to be prepared so that's it thanks for
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:13.500]   watching this is on a video that I'll be continuing in a series where I want to
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.620]   really focus in on health and healing and this really is kind of the video that's
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.460]   gonna kick that off so thank you for watching this is the Tinkers Academy a
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.260]   tinker for your health and if you can find a link to my blog below if you want
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.700]   to reach me and just you don't want to say hey thanks for watching the video
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.540]   appreciate your time hope this was educational and have a great day
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.140]   aloha
