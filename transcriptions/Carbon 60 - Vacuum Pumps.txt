[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me, Kay Elmer and in
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.640]   this video I'd like to talk about the vacuum pumps that we use when we're
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.840]   filtering out our C60 oil. What kind of came up in the chat room a while ago was
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.320]   a discussion about pumps which ones were better and so forth and then it seems
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.160]   like several folks have been kind of migrating to stronger pumps to kind of
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.960]   shorten the time frame it takes to to filter the oil and so I kind of decided
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.480]   that I would go ahead and do a test and kind of figure it out and then you know
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.480]   I told everybody I'd do a video on it so here you go this is the video of me
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.640]   dinking around with some pumps to see what would happen and and and how
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.600]   difficult it was to set them up and things so I'd been using like most of
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.520]   you I've been using the filter 8 vacuum pump I got about a year ago and that
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.000]   that guy is you know is doing doing fine and then this there's a new one now
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.880]   that it looks just like it but it's black it's called the Swift vacuum pump and
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.120]   then this is the Kazi vacuum you know industrial vacuum pump that I bought
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.880]   that a lot of folks are considering buying or have already bought and so this
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.280]   is the one that I got so just trying to compare the three different ones I did
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.400]   a little video so let me kind of walk you through it now the very first thing now
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.560]   with the Kazi vacuum is so different than the other two because it's like
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.600]   this little industrial motor it requires oil it so comes with a bottle of oil
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.760]   that you have to put into the into the pump and so kind of walk you through
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.400]   that this is the exit they're actually the exhaust port and also when you unscrew
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.760]   it it's where you pour the pump oil in so you have to take this this cap off
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.600]   pour the whole bottle oil in it comes out where the oil line is going to be
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.220]   between min and max so that's how you that's the very first thing you do is
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.120]   put the oil in and then this little brass thing right here is the intake
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.920]   nozzles now the intake nozzles on this much on this specific pump are there's
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.200]   two of them there's this side on the right which is one quarter inch and then
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.200]   the one the top is a half inch and so now the thing about this model and I
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.360]   because I haven't you know bought the other models but this specific model it
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.520]   doesn't come with any tubing and so it and it doesn't have any type of nozzle
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.480]   that you can put on that intake so that you could fit a tube on it right and so
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.080]   now I've known that other people have actually you know used different tubing
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.320]   to just kind of cover the whole thing and so forth but you know thank you to
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.120]   whoever posted on the chat room but they said that there's a nozzle you could
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.600]   stick on that thing as a half inch nozzle so you could actually use this
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.000]   little adapter and it's just screws right onto the top of of the intake valve
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.920]   and so there you go so that makes it so much easier to deal with as you need
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.640]   this little nozzle it's an extra little piece everything I'm talking about today
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.560]   the links are in the video description so once you get this nozzle it's so much
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.640]   easier to connect the tubing so now the other thing was that there's a huge
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.480]   issue with which is exhaust this thing's a motor it exhausts vapors and so when
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.440]   I when I first turned it on it was just spewing this oil vapor and it was
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.480]   difficult to breathe and so I was kind of choking on it and so I decided I would
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.920]   do a makeshift exhaust filter so I went to my local PetSmart and I bought some
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.640]   aquarium stuff I bought some activated charcoal bags and I got this gravel
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.200]   vacuum and in order to makeshift an exhaust filter so this is what I did
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.280]   everybody does something different obviously the only reason by the way the
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.120]   only reason I had to do this was I don't have a counter near a window so if I
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.000]   could I would have just stuck the tube out the window you know the other end of
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.200]   the exhaust tube but I can I'm stuck inside so I basically took the end of the
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.760]   tube covered it up with activated charcoal wrapped it up in cheese cloth
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.080]   and made an exhaust filter there's it so now this is the setup that I did and
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.000]   and the little this is what I want to point out about this little pyrex cup of
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.200]   water that's boiling water and I mean I really needed to use that to get the
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.720]   tubes to fit on but once I could put that in there for 30 seconds and make it
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.080]   pliable then I could start fitting the the different tubes up to the different
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.280]   filters and it went really well but highly recommend you know the old trick
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.840]   of just you know putting your end of the tube and boiling water so now that's
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.120]   the tube from the the gravel filter it fits perfectly if you notice right there
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.800]   it fits perfectly on the inside of the exhaust port and so it comes out it goes
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.480]   around the corner and then it's that little makeshift exhaust filter so this
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.040]   is the test that I ran I hooked up the filter 8 this is a 500 milliliter 500
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.240]   milliliter and a thousand milliliter disposable filters there's a olive oil
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:51.320]   C60 olive oil that had been using pulver IC60 it basically went through the
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.040]   one-week stirrings on occasion 10-day settle 10 micron filter 10-day settle
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.320]   and now this is the stage it's at this is avocado in the exact same state this
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.640]   is MCT oil MCT oil stir for two weeks settle for 10 days ready to filter okay
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.800]   you don't have to do a pre-filter these have been pre-filtered but with a 10
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.600]   micron so now it's all ready to go everything's ready to go at 0.22 which
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.520]   is each one of these three filters and so I've got 500 milliliters of olive oil
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.360]   ready to go with the filter 8 I've got 500 milliliters of avocado to go with
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.640]   the Swift and then I've got 1000 milliliters of MCT oil ready to go with the
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.680]   Kazi vacu and that's the test it's kind of like a little race to see which one
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.320]   goes first and so this is the setup and like I said you know really helped to
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.680]   use the the boiling water trick to get the hoses to all fit and in that it did
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.920]   work so everything worked really well the hose size is the I believe it's the
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.480]   5/16 inch just regular aquarium air tubing you can just get that anywhere
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.280]   it's super cheap and so I did have to use quite a bit of it so because this
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.360]   doesn't come with tubing and the tubing that came with the Swift was all bent up
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.160]   so I just threw that away and I just used my own so this was the setup now as you
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.240]   could see right immediately the MCT oil just starts pouring and so it worked
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.480]   really really well and the other thing about the exhaust fumes coming out of
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.000]   the other end of the of the Kazi vacu was interesting because I'll show you in a
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.880]   second see that they said all this mist right here yeah all that mist it's
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.840]   still coming out you know but just like you know like a filter on a car or
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.280]   something that mist was breathable it wasn't so hard to breathe and so it
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.560]   just would still mist out like this but it wasn't as bad as the first time when
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.280]   I didn't have anything to kind of just suck up the oil or whatever's coming out
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.400]   of that thing so you know so it kind of worked but it wasn't perfect now the
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.560]   next thing I want to kind of share with you is this at about the 300 milliliter
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.840]   mark when this thing had filled up about 300 milliliters I just heard this huge
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.040]   crack I was filming the exhaust filter and it was just big crack you know and
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.880]   then I ran I turned around the corner and just this whole thing the whole
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.800]   bottom of it just imploded due to the pressure of the vacuum that this little
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.120]   motor had created so it was it was my first instinct was throw to you know
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.640]   throw the paper towels down pour out the funnel into a jar and then you know
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.720]   then of course pick up the camera and keep rolling so so let me show what
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.720]   happened and and you know in hindsight I should have I shouldn't know I should
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.160]   have figured this I should have known that this was gonna happen I didn't
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.080]   even occur to me that I would blow the filter but look at the giant crack in
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.960]   the bottom the thing just imploded right and and you know in hindsight yeah that
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:42.000]   makes sense but I'll tell you know oh so anyway I wasted 300 milliliters of a
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.840]   very expensive brain octane C60 and so first lesson learned you can't use a
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:57.520]   Kazi Rev or Kazi Kazi Vacue motor with a plastic filter okay so this is where I
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.600]   stand at 15 minutes these two are still going on the side I'm just I had to
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.160]   clean the whole thing up and then I had to set up my my glass rig and plug that
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.160]   into the Kazi Vacue and so it worked but here's here's to show you we're at
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.800]   15 minutes the the Swift is just it's just just cranking away and there's
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.920]   almost nothing coming out of the the filter 8 but so this is what I I did this
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:26.120]   is take two on the on the MCT oil I only had about 700 milliliters left and
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.080]   then so I poured it in and started filtering away by this is like the the
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.920]   residue from the letting it settle and so it just cranking away I mean it's
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.600]   still 0.22 right and so this is at 30 minutes the the other the other filter
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.440]   fell out of the race but the two these two are still going at it with each
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.280]   other and as you can see the Swift is cranking and then here you go on this
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:55.160]   side it's like my 700 milliliters of MCT oil and it's done 14 minutes boom so
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.960]   you know clearly the bigger motor is stronger and it's going to run faster
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.760]   and do better and so I highly recommend this guy for the fact that you know boy
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.640]   it makes it so much faster and that's really a big deal when you're filtering
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.760]   you know leaders worth so totally totally dig that now if you don't have
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:18.920]   that you know patient or the the rush to have to get it done you know you go
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.560]   back to these two guys and here you go at 60 minutes the Swift is almost finished
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.720]   and look at that it's you're not even just just like nothing for the filter
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:33.920]   eight so it's clear that the Swift was you know really really really much much
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.320]   much stronger it's like one hour 20 minutes and boom it was done so the whole
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.880]   500 milliliters so what I did was I just unplug the olive oil from the
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.760]   filter eight I plugged in the Swift and soon as I turned it on watch I just
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.000]   turned it on and it's starting to come out this was the olive oil connected to
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.400]   the filter eight so that just kind of shows that that you know clearly whoops
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:02.720]   that's not right okay clearly you know there the Swift was was doing a lot
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.880]   better so these are the three pumps let's talk about prices now and stuff so the
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.560]   thing that's real interesting was that in the product specs to filter eight in
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.240]   the Swift are pretty much the same strength in terms of the ability to
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.760]   create a vacuum in cubic feet per minute so one was like 3.0 liters per minute
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.680]   this was 3.3 liters per minute if you read the product descriptions of the
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.320]   intakes nozzles are the same size and the prices are almost close the Swift
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.080]   is a little bit more expensive which is interesting because it doesn't have the
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:38.160]   case it doesn't have the the better tubing so the tubing quality is not that
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:43.760]   great there's no case and there's no rubber connector that helps you fit onto
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.980]   the the glass funnel and so that was that was interesting and then but the
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:53.000]   filter eight does come as a complete kit now the Kazi vacuum as you as I noted
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.120]   it was it was really strong it's 4.5 cubic feet per minute you know honestly I
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.960]   have never bought vacuum pumps until a year ago I don't know anything about
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.520]   vacuum pumps but I know a lot more now and you do too that you have to really
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.460]   take a look at how strong that thing can suck I guess is the best way to put it
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:15.120]   and so there's a 4.5 I bought the middle of the road for 79.99 it has you know
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.240]   the intake quarter inch and a half inch but you know there's a 3.01 which I
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.120]   probably should have bought the cheaper one which was 54 bucks and started out
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.160]   small I didn't really think about it this is the one that popped up on Amazon
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:31.680]   I just bought it right so so you know it's a little bit too strong but you know
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.160]   it works really great with the glass so you know it really depends now it
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.160]   doesn't come with any tubing doesn't come with nozzles and it requires oil
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.680]   so just keep in mind that you need to buy the nozzle for it you need to buy
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.920]   the tubing for it and and you know in order to get it to you know to use it
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.800]   and so by the way all of the these three filters are the links to them are in
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.000]   the video description below the video and so now the overall test results it's
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.400]   kind of walk you through it at the end of the day I thought about this for a
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.040]   while before making this video and you know I honestly think that the
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:09.880]   filter rate being the same strength and it's a year old I really believe that I
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.280]   I suspect that usage affects performance I think that because I have used it for
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:22.800]   a lot of hours I mean geez I've done over a couple dozen batches and I've left
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.000]   that thing running for like days before so I think I put a lot of hours on it
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.280]   and I think because it's like like a little tiny pump and it I think I just
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.520]   really beat the crap out of it and and because it's got a lot of usage that it
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.240]   really affected the performance I think in hindsight I should have bought a
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.680]   brand new filter rate and compared a brand new filter 8 to a brand new
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.840]   Swift so for you so you know so I don't want to disparage the fact that the
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:52.680]   filter 8 was so slow in this test it was a year old so in hindsight you know we're
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.280]   all so much smarter in hindsight so but you know but I so I definitely think
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:00.760]   that these little guys they're not going to last for more than a year before you
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.080]   see how slow it got right there's the way to look at it and so clearly you know
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.240]   for 40 bucks go get a new one after a year but the Swift is going to get a new
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.360]   one you know obviously the Swift works just as well but you know the thing was
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.800]   was that if I were to buy another little one again I probably buy another filter
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.400]   rate because it comes with really good tubing and it comes with the case so
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.760]   but because I have both I kind of just threw the filter rate away and put the
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:27.160]   Swift in the case and with the tubing so I have a I have a nice little set now
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.600]   that's so I'm good to go for batches I don't have to worry about and I'm not
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.880]   rushing to finish now the Causey Vacuio as I said this the smallest model is a
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:41.760]   3.0 this one I bought was a 4.5 and yeah it will blow your plastic filter
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.160]   stuff and so that was a really learning experience because I didn't think that
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:49.680]   was gonna happen but again in hindsight I should have expected that so you know
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.240]   but anyway the exhaust as you saw was a huge issue and if I could stick it out
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.920]   the window I would have but I couldn't so I did the best I could and you know
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.240]   when I ran it for 14 minutes I did have the the kitchen fan on and it was
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.320]   bearable but my house got really cloudy and so I had to open the doors and air
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:13.120]   out everything and so I don't recommend using that pump in a in an
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.920]   unventilated area where you have the windows closed and stuff so so yeah
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.160]   exhaust is clearly an issue you do need to buy an intake nozzle I think that's
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.520]   another like 11 bucks or so and you need to buy your own tubing so it doesn't
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.480]   come with anything except the oil itself so you know it has issues it's
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.880]   great it works fantastic but you have to deal with its issues right so that's
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.080]   life right anyway so I'm glad I'm glad you joined me thank you so much for paying
