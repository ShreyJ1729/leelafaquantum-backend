[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and this
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.760]   video I've got Philip on Holzendorf with me, the owner, operator, guru, leader of our patch
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.960]   for Leila Quantum Tech. He's with me and we're going to be doing a tutorial on how to use Tram EZ.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.320]   So, Philip, welcome. Thank you for joining me. Thanks for having me on.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.040]   Yeah, this is forward to this. Yeah, appreciate your time. As always, you know,
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.960]   I think the other two videos we did on Tram EZ was basically to explain how it works
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.840]   and then answering questions. So, this one is literally the tutorial for it. Now that it's
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.200]   been out for several months and kind of just really to help everybody understand how to best
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.920]   utilize it because there's been a lot more information that's been added to the user guide
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.800]   and so we're going to go through that and then talk about the different features of
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.280]   the service because I think, Philip, you were telling me and I totally agree with you a little
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.200]   while earlier that Tram EZ is this incredibly powerful tool and it's kind of like, you know,
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.560]   it's this third thing that you offer and there's not a lot of attention put onto it. I don't know
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.000]   how much like I watch your interviews and stuff but it just seems to be like this lonely little
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.480]   product out there that has so much potential and it doesn't get a lot of attention, you know.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.320]   So, I'm glad we're doing this. So, yes, I mean, indeed from my perspective, it's the most
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:39.680]   underestimated tool that we offer and for that fact, I really haven't talked much about it
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.680]   and one of the reasons is because when I get invited to these podcasts, people always heard
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.640]   about Lita Quantum Tech or like a friend told them about it or they got a capsule and they love
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.360]   it and know they want to know more and all of that. So, then I need to talk about that and then the
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.920]   next thing they hear about is like the quantum upgrade. So, we talk about that and I don't want
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.600]   to overwhelm people or the audience by bringing up yet another thing because then it just dilutes
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.800]   about what we're talking about and so the Tram EZ really, we have only really launched and
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.040]   communicated to the existing community and they know about it but we haven't really told anyone
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.040]   else about it and even the existing community, we haven't told enough, I feel. So, I'm glad we're
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.200]   talking about it today because it really is so powerful and I want to say up front why I think
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.840]   it is so powerful. First of all, because it really works, it really works and the second thing is
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.000]   and some people may not like this and I even sometimes with really hard stuff I'm working through
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.320]   sometimes also have a little resistance because you do the work with it. But then
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.520]   if you turn around everyone, everyone in the group that I know of at least, they've always
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:09.680]   been asking me since the beginning of the times in the community there, how can I perceive energy
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.240]   better, how can I practice that better, how can I connect more with my inner power and all of that
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:24.800]   and one of the things is you need to practice when you need to do it, you need to feel and this is a
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:31.920]   tool that actually lets you do that. So, because as you're going into these feeling like the
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.040]   heaviness of a trauma or something that's there, something that's blocking you, you're doing the
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.920]   work, you're putting the attention there, but then you have this tool that provides this energy
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.920]   orchestra to actually really release it. So, you have the help and you're also working, it's not
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.240]   that you just lay down like for a massage, you get a massage and then you're done with it, right?
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.640]   You're at the same time really doing some work, you're really getting into the, also the awareness
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.280]   of why it happened and all of that and that is so freeing and it's so powerful because that gets
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:19.040]   you further than anything you can just have done to you, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's honest
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:26.160]   for me, it's the hardest thing to try to use because there's so much to work through. I mean,
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.160]   you know, and that's why we're trying to do this video, right? But yeah, I've tried using it,
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.680]   it is very difficult because there's no one there to guide you like if you were to go into a session
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.880]   with, you know, with, you know, with, you know, energy workers or any of those types of individuals
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.840]   and they guide you, you have a guide, you know, for this one you're just kind of figuring that
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.360]   on your own. So, there's a steep learning curve, but yeah, you're right, the more I use it,
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:59.440]   the easier it becomes and then you have the, yeah, go ahead. Do you want to pay 250, 300, 400,
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:08.640]   500, 600 dollars per hour working with someone on just one trauma, right, that you may then release
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:16.160]   and then you have a hundred others or a thousand others and where do you really learn to get
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.600]   added yourself as things come up, you're working with it. And that's really the trick because you
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:28.240]   become an energy worker because you have the tool with that at hand that can actually
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:35.760]   release it as long as you sit down or lay down and just dedicate some attention to it.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.800]   That's a really good point. That's a really good point because yeah, you know, just seeing a natural
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.920]   path is expensive, let alone energy workers. I mean, it is because you're using someone's time,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:53.440]   but even more so though, I think just for me, it's I didn't really truly understand until I started
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.280]   getting into it that, you know, releasing traumas is it's not one at a time. It's like you just peel
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:07.200]   off it outside edge of an onion and just one trauma has multiple layers and it branches off
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.640]   into other stuff, you know, because once it happens, you become sensitive to related things
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.360]   or and so it's just bizarre that, you know, because when I first started, I was really naive. I thought,
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.160]   oh, I have XYZ, you know, so I'll just start working on this one. And then it was just like
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.120]   opening up the floodgates to a whole bunch of other stuff. And it was like, oh, it's not just
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.760]   a one for one thing. You got to keep working at it and working at it. So yeah, there's a there's
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:38.240]   a lot of effort involved. But you know, it's been very, I opening to say the least as to my progress.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:46.400]   I'm thrilled with it. And it also scares me. Yeah, what what the floodgates open, you never know
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.640]   what's going to come out. You know, so yeah, it's it's pretty power stuff. So I'm really
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.520]   supportive of this. And I'm glad we had the chance to do this. So let's jump in. But just let
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.320]   everybody know, we're going to talk about that there's a 10 step process for using the, you know,
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:11.360]   trauma easy service product on on yourself. And then you have two levels of trauma. So Philip's
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.200]   going to talk about both your conscious trauma that you're aware of. And then we all have unconscious
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.240]   trauma that we're not even aware we have we either brought it into our existence from
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.320]   our past prior to, you know, our birth or, you know, even things that happen when we were
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.200]   kids and we don't remember it happening. But there's we all have conscious and unconscious. So we're
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.720]   going to chat about that. There's also been questions that come up in our chat and our chat
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.480]   groups about, you know, how do we help children? How do we help the elderly? How do we help people
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.960]   that are, you know, that can't do it themselves? Right. And so, you know, Philip's going to
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.040]   admit talking about that. And of course, you know, you can use trauma easy when it's running on your
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.560]   phone, you could use a church food, water, you know, how that work. And then, of course, that
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.440]   new service that's coming up. So we'll touch on that. So before I jump in, they'll fill up on the
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.720]   on the main thing, which is, you know, using trauma easy for yourself. I do want to make sure everybody
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:10.240]   who has trauma easy is aware that, you know, Philip's gone ahead and had his team put together, you
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.600]   know, or update the original guide from the original time when it launched several months ago,
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.400]   there was a like a four or five page guide. Now the guide is now up to like 10 pages.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.520]   There's so much more detail in the guide. It talks about what I just mentioned. So please,
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.680]   if you haven't took a look, you know, took a look at that new guide, the updated one, you know,
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:36.320]   go to traumeezy.laq.com and go at the bottom of the page, you can download the guide again. And so
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:43.520]   you'll get this new really detailed updated guide and also the updated audio guide that accompanies
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.960]   the PDF. Okay. So make sure you've got the most recent one, because that's the one Philip will be
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:54.000]   talking through as we go today. All right. So Philip, let me just kind of leave it to you right now.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.640]   And let me tell everybody what's on the screen. There's 10 steps. It's like, I think it takes up
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.880]   six or seven of the pages of the new one. There's that much detail now. And then so I did ask Philip,
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.880]   you know, like if he could kind of like, how do you simplify it, you know, and so this is what
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:14.640]   he gave me and so I'm just going to leave it to you, Philip. Now, how do you use traumeezy
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.120]   for yourself or your conscious trauma? And so go ahead.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:28.560]   Yeah. So you identify and name name the trauma, whether that is, okay, the specific childhood
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:36.880]   trauma, or you had an accident at some point, or I don't know, you're always, you know, when you
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.120]   travel in an airplane, you start to have a lot of fear and you get a lot of anxiety, you know,
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.840]   whatever that is, you kind of have really a good feeling for that. And then you say you name it.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:57.840]   Then you ask your body and your consciousness, how strong or heavy on a scale from zero to 10,
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:08.800]   this trauma is. And what I always do is to really also say, you know, including any emotions,
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:16.960]   attachments, fear, pain regarding this, you know, whatever this is, right? And then
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.520]   that's your first task. And it's actually pretty easy. You don't need to
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:29.920]   brain into that or like have anxiety that you don't get a number of zero to 10. You will feel it.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.240]   It's just you will just feel it. And it may just come to you and you'll be like, oh,
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:39.600]   five. And I actually speak it out loud. You don't have to, but that's what I do.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:45.120]   And maybe it's a five, maybe it's a six. And even if you say then it's six,
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:51.040]   then you may have been feeling, oh, that's actually an eight or, oh, this is like, oh my god. And it
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.240]   may actually happen that right at that point, like things get very tense in your body, right?
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.400]   That's with very heavy stuff that that can really happen where you like, oh my god,
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.520]   like I'm having trouble breathing. It's just like we're because you're right there. You're poking.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:14.080]   The bear, I shouldn't say that. You're poking at the trauma, right? And so it's visible. It's
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:20.480]   right there. Maybe it's a nine, maybe it's a ten, whatever it is. You list that and then you stay
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:26.080]   in this, you close your eyes. That's an important factor actually. You want to close your eyes with
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:33.680]   this because you want to really stay in this feeling this. And so one important thing is,
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:39.600]   and that's why that's one reason why we're having this conversation, is that if we have
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:46.320]   uncomfortable feelings come up, usually our reaction is to run away from it or to bury it
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:52.320]   or not to ignore it, right, to put it somewhere. And I must say, in my early life, that's exactly
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:59.600]   what I did. Like I put this stuff anywhere I could, but I would not look at it. And that's why I had
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:07.440]   such a long time of working through it since, I mean, I started this journey in the early 2000s,
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:13.440]   right? And oh my god, I did a half stuff that came up and I was thinking, well,
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:19.600]   I was done with everything and then stuff came up. So in this case here, you're getting this feeling,
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.160]   you're getting like the age, for example, and you feel this tension or you feel an
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:32.160]   uncomfortable or you feel that heaviness and breathing, stay there, like feel it, feel it,
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:39.120]   you know, let it come up, you know, be there. And no, you have this tool on your thymas gland,
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:44.640]   that is actually it's like an energy orchestra that is playing, that is transforming that.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:52.320]   And you can even ask, you know, then, okay, so then, so what I do is, I, you know,
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:13:02.640]   that I ask that this be transformed now in all dimensions, in all bodies, and in all times, right,
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.880]   that's, you know, you don't have to do that, but you can just add to that maybe by doing that.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.400]   And you stay with this feeling, you know, you stay with this, this emotion that may come up
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:20.320]   where you stay with it. But what you don't do is you don't hold on to it. Okay, so and that's an
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:27.200]   important distinction, you feel it. But at the same time, you allow yourself to let go. And when
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.840]   you're stuck, let's say, and then you're going from eight to seven, and then you're stuck at the
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:39.120]   seven, and it's like for five minutes, you're at the seven as an example, then you are holding on.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:46.160]   So then just stay, you know, we're letting this go, we are letting this go, but it's not like that
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.040]   you're ignoring it, you're still feeling it, but you're also letting it go. And then you'll,
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:56.480]   you'll see how it will move again. And then you go to six, and you until you add the zero, right?
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:07.360]   And then basically, so we're at the point four now, where you then basically done with zero,
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:15.360]   and then you repeat those steps by asking your whole we basically, which includes your soul,
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:22.400]   your subconsciousness, your consciousness, and your body. And you do the same thing, right?
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.880]   This is the simplified version in general. Also, even what's in the in the guide is sort of
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.840]   simplified, because you could also go more in more detail by going through each of these,
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:40.160]   you could do the body and consciousness together, then you could do the subconsciousness, and then
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:46.640]   you could do the soul level, and then you do the we so you would have four, four run throughs,
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:53.040]   basically. That's when you go at it in very detailed, could be used for very heavy traumas,
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.440]   for example, if you have the feeling to do that, you could just do that, right? I mean,
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:05.040]   that's totally fine. Most people in general, and with most traumas, it's okay to just do it this
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.400]   way, and it's certainly the quicker way to do it. But if you have the feeling, you just want to take
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:16.640]   your time with it, then you can do it the other way as well. Yeah, and then after that, you're done.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:25.680]   And you know, you could then check the next day, for example, or even right after,
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:32.560]   you can do those last step one more time, right? Asking, asking again, because maybe something just
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:38.400]   bubbled up, you know, and came back in, you know, the next layer of the onion showed up,
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:44.640]   or there's something that you missed, right? Or that you count it too fast, and then you'll just
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:50.400]   feel if there's a four again, or a five, or you if you're still at zero, until you're really at zero,
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:56.240]   and then you're pretty much done with it. And so the positive thing is, so you're not done with
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:03.200]   these five steps, right? Because the important part is, and that's so essential in trauma work,
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:12.160]   really, is that you are then asking for understanding why it happened, right? So basically,
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:21.200]   step six, I should have put there, is that you ask your soul, why did this happen to me? You know,
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.480]   what's the reason? What is what did I need to learn, right? You know, that's basically what
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:33.600]   you want to find out. And then just you sit back, you just wait, you know, maybe you see a picture,
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.320]   maybe you hear something, maybe you feel something, maybe you suddenly know something,
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:44.000]   maybe there's an aha moment, there's, or there's like, there's going to be something that is
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:56.320]   also practicing, you know, how to listen to your inner God, right, to your, to your higher self. And
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:04.560]   it's just listening, you know, and you will know you will get this feeling. And then when that is
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:12.640]   done, maybe it's like, oh, okay, because I needed to learn that if I, if I shut off completely,
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:18.880]   it has this negative effect on all these other people as well. And I hurt them with that, right?
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:25.600]   And then, and then you're like, oh, wow, no, and I know I really realized this now. And
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:31.600]   now I just don't do that anymore, right? Maybe, you know, you don't bury your feelings anymore,
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.800]   maybe you deal with them as they come up, you know, that could be one of those things.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:44.960]   And then the last step really is you, you ask, okay, so what's, what's, what's your soul's desire
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:52.640]   now, you know, basically to, to make out of this, you know, how do we move forward from this? And,
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.480]   and you'll also feel that, and usually it's very related to the awareness, you know, to give you
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:06.800]   this example, maybe you, you always bury your feelings. And now you realize, wow, this hurt my
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:13.280]   kids, right? Because I, because I did so, I was so closed off and I just hurt them all the time
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:21.360]   because of that. And now I don't do that anymore. And because I just realized that like next time
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:27.200]   I'm going to be sad or I'm, I'm angry or whatever, I deal with these feelings. Now what's the soul's
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:34.000]   desire in that specific case? It's just that you really deal with the things as they come up and
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.840]   that you don't bury this stuff, right? That is really what your inner core really wants. And then
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:45.600]   you got it, you solved it, you transformed the trauma, you realized why you had it, what a great
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:53.040]   learning experience. And wow, now we can move forward with this new energy to treat these things
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:59.600]   differently moving forward. And you'll, you'll see that that specific trauma is gone. It is gone.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.320]   And you're not falling back into it. It's that you have a completely different attitude to that.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:11.840]   Doesn't mean it's not difficult when you run into these situations with, oh, there's tough emotions
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:19.360]   coming or my mother dies or, you know, this or that doesn't mean, but it's, it's the way how you
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:26.480]   deal with it. And, and that is the key. So, so I hope people understand that and you can apply this
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.720]   example on how to go through to any trauma. There's not a single trauma you couldn't go through
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:38.480]   with this like that. Okay. Yeah, you know, just for some clarification,
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:43.280]   because questions come up all the time, but I just want to point out to everybody that, you know,
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:49.840]   the inner, it's, it's an energy and a frequency. It's on your phone. Your phone does not need to
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:56.640]   be turned on. So it can be on off or in airplane mode. It doesn't matter. But it's, think about it as
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:04.080]   it's no longer a phone. When you're using it for traumasie, it becomes a quantum device. So you take
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:11.120]   this quantum device, it's got this incredible energy and frequency on it. And use that as a tool,
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.000]   like you would be a capsule, right? And so then the placement to I kind of want to clarify for
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.400]   everyone, because I clarified this before we started with Philip, I just want to make sure,
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:26.480]   you know, the place the the placement of your thymus gland is between the throat and heart chakra.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.120]   So it's right in the middle between the two. So you want to make sure that it goes right there.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:36.400]   And and I did have a question for you, Philip, like, how did you discover that that was the place
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:42.160]   that that your body was to me, it's like a portal, right? It's a portal of your emotional
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:47.760]   being. And that that when you place that energy at that portal? Absolutely. Yeah. So that's actually
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:55.200]   something that Johannes, the healer from Austria, you know, set up from the from the beginning. That's
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:00.800]   that's how he set up the whole thing. So that's I can't take any credit for that. For me, it makes
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.520]   sense, though, because on just on the first of all, on the physical level, that's an important
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:12.000]   gland, actually, and then energetically, it's right between your heart, you know, which is the most
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:19.920]   powerful, you know, area we have energetically in our physical existence here. And then the
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:27.120]   throat chakra, which is basically it stands for expressing yourself in this reality, right? To
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:35.280]   and and if because of trauma, often our heart is damped in, or we can't really express
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:42.400]   what's really truly within us. So it's I think a pretty good spot energetically in general for
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:49.280]   that, but but you're totally right, you know, it is. That's where you if you put it there, it's sort of
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:57.840]   activating this process. And then, you know, obviously, most people don't really
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:05.760]   yet see energy in the way they they wonder they can and probably will at some point in the future.
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:11.840]   So they may be wondering, okay, so why can't I just place it there and it just transforms all
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:17.760]   of my traumas? Well, you know, that because that's not how it works. And it really is
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:24.640]   you're in the driver's seat, right? It's it's your life, and it's also your responsibility.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:31.200]   So now if and it's it's also free will. So if you now put your attention towards
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.080]   something that you want to release, that is coming up and then now actually this energy can
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:41.360]   actually help you do that, right? And then you can go on to the next one and to the next one
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:48.880]   and you're working on these, you know, to be aware of what's actually happening. So that is
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:58.000]   that is why that is. Yeah, so putting it here is real important. And it really does work. And so
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.200]   okay, so that's that and okay, so these are the simplified 10 steps. The full 10 steps is in the
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.400]   guide. Okay, so this is the guide if you download it. So recommend reading through the guide, you
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:15.680]   know, read the directions. These are the quick, you know, the quick reference steps, you know,
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:20.480]   and going heading and doing it. And then again, like to your point, Philip, and I think this is
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:26.160]   really important is you have to really work with it. You have to try it, practice makes perfect,
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.680]   and and let your let your I guess you let your heart, you know, guide the way, right?
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:40.000]   Yes. And again, so you know, that's that's the one thing. So we we often have this resistance of
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.360]   doing something or then we may feel like, well, but I can't do this, like, you know, like, how can I
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:52.240]   now release this trauma or it feels so heavy? How can I get it done? But know that you have this
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:57.520]   tool and it'll do that. All you need to do is you need to dedicate a little bit time,
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:06.080]   some attention to it, and and the willingness to face it. Okay, so that is so you man up
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:15.360]   by doing that. Or you woman up, you know, and days, well, and then now I need to repeat it like
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:22.960]   100, 100 more times, right? Yeah, really other 600 genders we have. But you get the point,
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:28.240]   that's kind of what you're doing. And that's that's what that's what's required in the process,
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.840]   because we need to we need to deal with it. We need to face it. But then as we do, you know,
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:41.040]   then there's the instant blessing because it it can go. And and that makes us feel so much
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:48.560]   lighter. And you will notice by using this on a regular basis, you will get much more connected
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:57.840]   with yourself. You will sense energy way better. And guess what? And after having done this multiple
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:04.160]   times, you'll be actually learning how to help others with this, right? And that's actually a
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:10.720]   thought I'm having because we're still working on, you know, the certified quantum healer course,
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:17.760]   we're on the bottleneck because we wanted to launch it already like six months ago, and it
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.480]   probably still takes another three or six months until we launch it. And I think another one will
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:29.280]   be or that will be just like an add on to that is, you know, how to help others with trauma. And then,
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:35.120]   you know, this app can be used. And you can also really help someone like, you know, the ones that
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:41.120]   that just feel they just can't get it, they need to have someone to learn it. And then maybe the first
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:47.760]   five, six session, you do it or for every every trauma, you do it with them, which also brings me to
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:57.280]   an idea that I have that in the future, I would want to at least two, three times a year set up
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:07.840]   a free webinar with everyone that has the trauma easy app to, you know, dedicate that to a little
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:17.760]   bit Q&A, but to a real trauma release session, right? So where I will pick a trauma that comes up that
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:26.160]   is, you know, usually something that everyone has, and then we'll work through that together. And if
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.720]   someone already just worked on that specific trauma, they just can pick your own, their own,
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:37.200]   and they can still participate in this. So that way it becomes a little bit also of a group effort,
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:43.920]   and we can exchange and all that. That's an idea I have that I want to do because we should really
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:51.360]   talk about this more and help people use it because it's so powerful. And by the way, I want to say
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:59.440]   you're also, and Johannes asked me, so Johannes is not available for any private sessions or anything,
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.400]   so please do not reach out to him. He specifically asked me, he doesn't want to deal with any emails,
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:09.440]   he doesn't have any time for any private sessions, not even if you offer a half a million bucks,
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:17.280]   he doesn't do that anymore. He just focuses on this and keep the energy running and all of that,
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:26.000]   and to keep developing it. So yeah, because we had two cases that reached out to him lately,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:33.120]   I wanted to set up sessions, and he just does not have the time for that. We apologize, but you know,
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:40.800]   he says, please, you know, learn how to use this and you'll be self-sufficient.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:46.640]   Yeah, okay. Thanks for sharing that. But yeah, you know, your point's really well-taken. I didn't
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:54.160]   think about it until you told me just now that you're using this process, you're training yourself
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:28:00.560]   to become an energy worker first on yourself, and then the imagine, you know, imagine the benefit
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.880]   you can have for your loved ones, once you get really good at this, you can help them as well.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:10.000]   So that's, that's a, I didn't think about it that way, but wow, you're right, I didn't think
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.920]   about it. Teaching, I am actually teaching myself to be an energy worker. That's pretty wild. So
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:23.600]   speaking of helping others, well, this segue is right into our next update that's on the guide,
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:29.520]   is using trauma easy for unconscious trauma, which is basically helping yourself, but you're
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:35.280]   helping yourself with something you're, you're not conscious of. So can you talk, talk about that,
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:41.200]   and then let's, and then I've got here the steps for how to go about doing it. But for people that,
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.680]   like, not may not be familiar with what, what you mean when you put in the guide, you know,
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:50.240]   what is unconscious trauma? How would you, you know, what's your, what's your quick explanation for that?
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:57.200]   Well, that's the typical situation. You're on a, I don't know, a tall building and you get
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:08.960]   complete anxiety, right? And you, you just don't know why. I have that. So I don't know why.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:20.160]   Terrified heights. Yeah. And it can have multiple reasons, right? It could come from a past life.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:26.000]   It can come from whatever, right? Something out of the childhood that you just don't remember,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:35.280]   you have no, no excess to it. Whatever, right? So, and you don't know. So then just name the
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:44.800]   situation. Just name the situation. And so let's say, okay, so this, the, the situation of,
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:52.080]   step by step, always when I'm on a tall building, I get this anxiety and the trauma related to this,
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:59.600]   the trauma, the origin related to this, okay? Then you basically work through, through the,
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:04.960]   the very same way that we just described. It's just that you go at it like that.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:10.640]   And, and I want to say something important here. That's also part of something that we didn't.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:19.360]   I don't think we, we, we put it into the, the guide yet and we, we really should. But, so,
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:29.680]   you can not only release traumas with it, but also promises and oaths and curses.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:37.840]   Yes. But you wouldn't, you would need to name that. So let's say you're working on
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:45.600]   something and then you're working through the, the trauma, right? And then you still feel like a
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:53.520]   heaviness or something or something didn't go away, right? Then just list art in relation to this.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:31:06.240]   Are there any promises, curses, oaths out of any lifetime and give me,
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:15.600]   so I'll give me a number between zero to 10, okay? So then in relation to exactly that,
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:20.880]   you will also get a number from zero to 10. You go through the very same process. There's nothing
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:27.520]   different. It's the same thing. And then all of those will get transformed in relation to this
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:35.280]   specific topic, right? Wow. Really? Okay. Have you tried that on yourself? Yes. Oh, yeah. Wow.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:44.560]   No, it's wild. It's wild. Because I swear, I'm carrying a curse from a prior life, I swear.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:49.680]   I have this really weird thing about me that it's, and I've been like, why, you know, why? I've
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:55.680]   been asking myself my entire life, why do I have this weird thing about me? And I just swear that,
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:01.440]   you know, like, I'm like paying my karmic debt. Is that's kind of what you mean, right? If we're
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:07.040]   stuck because we're all stuck with karmic debt, right? From past lives. And you're telling me that
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.640]   we could use that even because it's unconscious, we're not sure what the debt is. But we could,
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:19.120]   like basically name an emotion that we feel or a situation we suspect of and ask our soul,
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:25.440]   hey, is this a karmic debt? Is this a curse or is an oath I took or, you know, and then use that
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:31.040]   and name it and then, and then walk through the emotional step step of it and then just, so that's
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:36.160]   right. I mean, that's what you're saying. Yep, pretty much the way you do that. So in regards to
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:43.600]   this, are there any curses oath or promises? You can also then expand it to attachments,
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:49.760]   whatever, right? You know, so all of those, because all of those will be transformed. And you,
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:55.200]   you ask for a number from zero to 10. So you, in your case, how great is that? You even know that
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:00.400]   there's a curse somewhere, right? So that's that's already more than most people know for a specific
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:05.920]   situation. And actually, in the last situation, I dealt with, I didn't know that there was actually
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:14.240]   a huge promise, right? I had no clue. And, but then as you name it, then it just comes up because you're,
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:21.280]   you're subconscious, your soul is then is taken over because it's, it's, it's showing you the
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:26.560]   heaviness of that, right? That's why you're like zero to 10. Okay, zero, there's nothing. Okay,
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:31.600]   yeah. Okay, there's nothing. I feel great. I feel totally like, but if it's heavy, something is
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:37.600]   happening, you know, you will feel it. And you don't have to know that that's a curse. You just
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:44.560]   list it and list list them all together. Curse oath, promise. Is there anything? Give me a number
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:52.560]   from zero to 10. You get a number, you work with the app, go on zero, done. Wow. Okay, that's
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:58.720]   amazing. I never thought about that way. But yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. I, I, it feels like a curse,
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:03.920]   but I know that I'm just, I'm just living my karma. I mean, we're all just living our karma.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:12.640]   But you know, it's kind of like, you know, why does, why does this life have to pay for that life?
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:19.760]   It wasn't me. I didn't do that stuff. I was like, but you're, but the universe goes, no, no,
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:24.880]   no, that was you. And okay, all right, I'm definitely going to try some of that. Yeah,
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.200]   I actually can name it, you know, because there's, it's just like, it's just this coincidental thing
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.360]   that's happened throughout every relationship I've had, every, you know, intimate and really,
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:39.760]   you know, relationship. And I was like, why does every single time does this manifest itself? And
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.720]   okay, no, no, you need to report out in the, I've got some
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.520]   I've got, you know, it's like, well, you know, like, we're like, we're all of us are just, you
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:54.400]   know, we're all humans, but we're also, you know, we're all these, you know, we're traveling souls,
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:59.360]   right? I mean, when you say contract or like oaths and promises, you're, are you mentioning like,
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.560]   do you fall feel like it falls into the whole concept of soul contracts? You know, like, yes,
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.120]   yeah. And contracts, by the way, that's a good point. Obviously, in this that as well, like,
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:15.360]   promises, oath, curses, contract, just this, all of those, if you have a feeling that is something,
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:20.400]   yeah. Okay, so there's conscious and unconscious, follow the same steps, put a name to it,
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.840]   but it's not just trauma now, we just learned something new, that you can get into your soul
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.240]   contracts, you can get into your karmic debt, you can get into curses and all these kinds of
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.080]   things. So that's really amazing. Okay, all right, so that's something new, folks. So
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:38.160]   give it a try. And, you know, and good luck on your journey becoming an energy worker.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:45.040]   Okay, so now helping children, that's come up a lot, you know, because because obviously,
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:49.520]   children are just traveling souls and they've been around a lot longer, they're just smaller.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:56.240]   Is there anything special about helping a child when you yourself are actually
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:04.000]   using the trauma service on another person? And this, yeah, so if it's if it's a child that cannot
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.600]   do it on his or her own, right, because it's still too young, the kid is still too young, then
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:18.800]   you, you pretty much do it the same way you can do it with a cat over to dog. And I wanted to get
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:25.920]   into that as well. You can actually also use it for dogs. And I actually had a good friend that
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:31.840]   reached, had reached out and said, you know, I, I've actually seen that my dog has this
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:39.520]   trauma and is there anything I can do? And so yeah, so here's how you deal with that. You,
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:50.720]   you can basically then connect energetically to the dog and or the child, right? And you feel
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:57.040]   in like you connect and the phone, of course, will be will be placed on the
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:07.840]   thymus gland, not of yourself, but the the child in this case, right, or the dog on that, that area
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:15.840]   up there close to the throat. And then you, when you then ask, like the zero, so you name it then,
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:22.880]   right, or you describe it, then you ask the zero to 10. And you're basically, you're getting the
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:29.040]   answer for that, because you're connecting. And it's actually very simple, because you can energetically
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:34.800]   do that, right? Your subconscious right away knows that it's just a matter of you getting some
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:41.120]   form of feeling for it. That's another practice, actually, right? And, and you can really help.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.560]   And you just go through the same process. So it's actually relatively simple.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.560]   Wow. Okay, I'm going to definitely give that a try. I think the key, though, is like, this is
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.560]   your response on telegram when you were asked. I don't know if you knew I did that, but
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:59.440]   I grab your answers on telegram for these decks. But yeah, this is what you responded. And I think
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:04.320]   you're you're right. I think step one is the key. You got to get good at it using it on yourself
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.640]   before trying to use it on someone else. But once you familiarize yourself,
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.920]   then you could work with other folks on it. And you've now are, you know, you've now graduated
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.080]   as an energy worker. But yeah, that, okay. So our animals as well.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:25.040]   I want to say here, because so the way that they had set it up in Austria is that this app, or you
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:33.840]   know, the the Trump easy version that they have there, that it cannot be used by so if you own
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:39.760]   this phone, right? And it's your Trump easy, for example, you cannot use it for anyone else.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:46.560]   The way that we set it up, though, for our community worldwide is that you can indeed
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:53.200]   use it for someone else. So not only are you training yourself to really become much more
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:39:01.520]   connected and learning more to perceive energy and yeah, becoming growing into becoming an energy
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:09.360]   healer in a way, you can actually also do the work. And there's one thing, one big advantage that you
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:16.400]   have over anyone else learning to work with energy is that you have this super powerful tool
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.160]   with you that you can leverage. So you don't have to do it all yourself.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.600]   So, you know, with someone with traumis, they could literally loan their phone to somebody,
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.880]   right? To use it for themselves, use it, you know, you help them or in this case, they can
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.520]   wide open wide open. Yeah. So that's the whole that's, yeah, that's the beauty of just the way
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:39.760]   you do businesses, you know, it's share, give it away, share it, you know, help others spread the
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:46.480]   spread the energy, you know, that's awesome. Okay, so that's how you would help people who
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:52.640]   can't help themselves. And then also here, the other thing that the Trump easy service does
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:57.680]   is it charges food and water. So now I took this off a telegram, someone said, well, you know,
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.920]   how long. So I just want to just make sure we're all on the same page. You said
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:07.840]   that it was one to two minutes for a regular charge and four minutes for a sensitivity
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:13.920]   challenge. Could you clarify what the difference is? Yeah, so most people, if they don't have any
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:22.400]   food sensitivities whatsoever, one to one to two minutes is totally fine, usually with with any
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:28.560]   foods and water and so on. But anyone that has little trouble with the guts or food sensitivity
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:35.280]   in general, you know, go ahead, do it for four minutes. And yeah, that's the real only difference.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:40.320]   Or you know, hey, even if you're not sensitive and you have the time, just go ahead and do it.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:47.120]   Okay, all right. So yes, you can literally charge your food and water. So now the proximity,
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:51.920]   as you as we were chatting earlier, is you place like in the picture right here, you would place
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:58.800]   your phone next to the food and water, right? Yeah. And then, correct, even if you're in a restaurant
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:06.160]   and you're you're on the other side of the table is your friend, right? I mean, his or water would
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:12.080]   still get energized by that because water is so receptive and the energy of the phone really
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:17.840]   so goes way further. But you know, I would always, if I really want to charge something,
[00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:22.720]   I always put it right next to it. I think that's good practice. Okay, so now what about other stuff?
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.520]   We had this question about, you know, can it charge plants? Can it charge other people, you
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:32.640]   know, like my people, plants, animals, you know, but you're mentioning that it's just it's purely
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:38.080]   just for food and water. That only has that much energy, right? That it can only go up to just a
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:42.960]   plate of food or a glass of water. Is that correct? Yeah, you know, I mean, I wouldn't, you know,
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:49.600]   you can't really charge metals with it and with plants that's untested. So I don't know what,
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:54.400]   you know, what can be done there. It's definitely not programmed to specifically
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:42:03.760]   help plants because it's really targeted towards humans. And then in regards to the trauma release
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:10.560]   and the EMF protection and all of that, obviously that's for anyone, any dog and cat and all of that.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:21.600]   So the toxin harmonization, same thing, obviously, anyone in anything in that proximity then benefits
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.800]   from that. But yeah, we really haven't tested to charging specific vegetables.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:33.280]   Okay. All right. So tinker away, everybody. That's not tested. I don't know. Okay. All right.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:38.320]   So then the last thing about trauma Z and I just wanted to touch on this for anyone who did not
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:45.040]   watch the product update video, Phillip and I did a month ago, I guess, is that there's a new feature
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.760]   coming out this year called Vax Harmonization. So do you want to just mention it? And then
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:55.600]   I guess we're going to, once that product is released, then we'll go and do a specific tutorial
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:00.960]   for all of the steps involved with this. But yeah, Phillip, did you want to mention that since
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.760]   we're doing a trauma Z video? Like what's coming up and when is it coming out? I guess is the big
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:10.960]   question people keep asking. Yeah, we already wanted to release it a few weeks ago and we've
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:17.600]   been ready since several weeks, but the app has been approved for the Google Play Store already,
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:25.040]   but Apple is still going back and forth with us. So we're answering them, we're answering them,
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:30.320]   getting more questions and so on. So I hope it'll be done within a week, but it really depends on
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:35.200]   Apple. So I can't tell you, I hope within the next couple of weeks we'll be done with that
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:41.120]   and can launch it. And then you will have this and then also the amazing travel function and the way
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:48.800]   that this works here is that this is in regards to any Vax you've ever received and any
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:59.600]   impact of shedding that may have happened and also any substance abuse of any kind,
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   any drug, any medication, alcohol, you know, you name it, all of that doesn't matter. You can
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:16.560]   basically go harmonize it with this. And right after you're done, you can actually
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:25.520]   also do a specific trauma release in that regard. Let's assume, okay, because with the Vax, for
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:31.840]   example, you're sort of entering a contract also by doing that. And it's traumatic,
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:40.160]   you know, having received that on some level, at least it could be way more dramatic in some cases
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:45.520]   and less dramatic in other cases. Regardless, it's a trauma and you can work through that after
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:51.360]   that. But the harmonization happens first, it's about a 10 minute process, give or take,
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:57.600]   and there you actually don't need to do anything other than sort of name it and you place it on
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:03.920]   your thymus gland. But I don't want to go through the exact steps here. It's just super, super simple
[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:09.200]   because once we launch it, you'll have the exact steps there. It'll show you exactly how to do it.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:15.680]   Okay. All right. So we're just basically anytime in the next month or so, it's going to be releasing
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:21.680]   it. Oh, okay. So it actually comes with an app that works with the energy on the phone. I guess
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:28.240]   that's the best. Yes. And you can also use this for your friend or spouse, you know, again, so,
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:33.600]   which is quite amazing. And there's no extra cost, you know, for this feature, by the way.
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.920]   Oh, that's cool. It's included. Okay. Great. Okay. So that wraps up the,
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:43.280]   how to use trauma easy and all of the new stuff that's in the guide. Again, I want to remind
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:50.080]   everybody go to traumys.layla.q or laylaq.com at the bottom of the page, download your new guide.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:56.880]   And of course, there's this audio guide where a person speaking to you, walking you through the
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:01.200]   10 steps. So, you know, there's a little bit of a companion audio that goes with the guide.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:07.520]   It's got full detail. You can reference this video, this slide right here for the quick steps.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.800]   And then don't forget, once you get really, you know, get comfortable doing yourself,
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:16.720]   you can do your unconscious stuff, then you could do helping others and so forth. And,
