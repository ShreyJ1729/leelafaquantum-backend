[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   how to maintain your h2 genesis browns gas generator whenever the water level gets to 0.8 on the front
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.000]   water indicator you need to then take the water from your filters and fill the tank back up you
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.480]   want to take the one on the right which side label number two and then you want to unscrew that from
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.200]   the top pour the water into the tank by popping off the top of the column comes off really simply
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.400]   just want to make sure you have some clumber's tape on there to keep it snug once you put the
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.280]   water in there you then cover it back up put the top back on you need to fill up that that bubble
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.040]   filter with distilled water because that's what's going to go into the tank the next time you do
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.280]   this then you go ahead and screw that back on to the top of the filter thing and then you go ahead
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.040]   and put it away then you grab the first one which is the first one that comes out of the tank
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.440]   and now that one is just regular water and i want to basically toss that into the sink don't need
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.800]   that anymore rinse out the cup and then i just go and use fresh just regular filtered water you
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.800]   don't need to use distilled because it's not going in the tank you go ahead and connect that back up
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.840]   to the the top of the filter bubbler and there you go you're done you've now replenished the tank
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.560]   and you've replenished your bubble
