[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.960]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and this video is a little different.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.560]   Leila Quantum Tech just recently published a new book called Quantum
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.080]   Energy and Longevity.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.600]   And I thought it'd be a really interesting idea to just kind of feed it
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.560]   into Google notebook and have it produce a two person podcast.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.040]   All AI generated discussing the book and all of the ideas in the book.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.920]   For those of you who would like to listen to books instead of maybe
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.520]   reading them page by page.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.560]   So without further ado, here's the podcast on quantum energy
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.000]   and longevity by Leila Quantum Tech.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.880]   Aloha.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.680]   All right, so get ready.
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.680]   Today we're going to be going deep on longevity.
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.480]   Yeah, longevity.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.720]   We are going to be exploring how long humans can realistically live.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.240]   What we might do with that extra time.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.480]   And, you know, are those fountain of youth myths?
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.280]   Are those real?
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.200]   Like what's going on?
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.800]   Yeah, right.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.960]   Our guide for this deep dive is a document that's just absolutely
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.280]   packed with research.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.640]   And it's called uncovering the secrets to longevity.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.840]   That's a good one.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.760]   It really delves into like the history, the science.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.080]   And the even like the philosophy behind, you know, right?
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.800]   Humanity's just constant quest for a longer life.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.240]   It starts with a statistic that really just blew my mind.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.720]   OK.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.480]   Hemi back in 1800, life expectancy in America, OK, was only 35 years.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.360]   Wow.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.880]   That's it.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.920]   Today, it's almost 80.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.160]   Oh, wow.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.240]   That's more than double.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.880]   It's yeah.
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.040]   So before we even get into like the hat, like, how is that even possible?
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.560]   I'm kind of curious about the why.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.120]   What, what is this like desire that we all have to live longer?
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.960]   I think it's something that's just woven into our very nature, you know.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:03.160]   Across cultures, across, you know, time, I think humans have always tried to figure
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.200]   out, like, how can we understand death, right?
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.520]   Delay death, even conquered death.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.520]   So it's not even just about the fear of like dying, but just, you know, would just.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.320]   I think it's just that yearning for more, you know, more time, more life.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.640]   Exactly.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.920]   Yeah, more experiences.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.480]   Exactly.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.280]   And as science and technology, like advanced, you know, I feel like that yearning is
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.360]   turning into, you know, an actual quest to extend the human lifespan.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.560]   Some projections even suggest that life expectancy in the U.S.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.480]   could hit 93 by 2050.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.560]   Ninety three.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.840]   Wow.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.640]   It's crazy.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.160]   It's amazing.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.400]   But that also raises some big questions for sure.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.600]   Let's say we actually do it.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.440]   We actually push those limits even further.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.280]   What are we going to do with all those years?
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.480]   Right.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.640]   Are we just going to be sitting around?
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.000]   And how do we even make sure that those years are full of, you know, yeah.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.520]   Yeah, totality and not just existing.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.000]   Exactly.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.800]   And in this document, it doesn't shy away from that.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.480]   Like, right.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.640]   You know, even with longer life spans, aging is going to have its challenges.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.360]   It's not just about, you know, adding years.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.480]   It's like, you know, you're adding life to those years.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.680]   Are those years good years.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.520]   Exactly.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.800]   And it paints a pretty crazy picture of what could happen.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.480]   Like, if we just focus on extending lifespan, yeah, but not dealing with the
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.240]   quality, right?
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.600]   You're just going to those years, right?
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.080]   Yeah, you're going to have bones aching, right?
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.200]   Memory fading, senses dulling.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.000]   Like your eyesight going, it's not pretty.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.480]   Yeah, it's okay.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.840]   And this, the document introduces us to this guy, Ian Mitchell.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.600]   Ian Mitchell, okay.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.720]   And he's a researcher and he uses this term.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.040]   That I kind of love.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.360]   Okay.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.800]   He talks about our meat suits.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.760]   Meat suits, yeah.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.880]   It's like, it's pretty blunt.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.040]   It is, but I get it.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.960]   I, yeah, it's like our physical body.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:58.880]   Yeah, the limitations.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.560]   And, and he argues that there's an energetic component to aging that we just.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.440]   Oh, interesting.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.760]   Like kind of overlook.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.960]   So he's drawing a distinction between like the physical and the cognitive.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.600]   Yeah, he makes this really interesting distinction between like physical
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.480]   and cognitive evolution.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.920]   Okay.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:25.040]   And he did the study on mice where he like extended their lifespans dramatically.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.840]   Okay.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.280]   But the last 2% of their life was just like a huge drop in quality.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.120]   Oh, so it's like a cautionary tale.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.000]   Anything.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.840]   Like be careful what you wish for.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.080]   Right.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.720]   You might get it, but is it what you want?
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.800]   Yeah, you can push the physical limits, but what about our consciousness?
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.280]   What about what's going on in our minds?
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.640]   You know, the inner world.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.760]   So, so what does he suggest we do?
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.040]   Well, he thinks we need to look at practices that go beyond just the physical.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.280]   Okay.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.040]   Like meditation, yoga, Tai Chi, things like that.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.560]   And that's where this document brings up this idea of quantum energy.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.960]   Okay, quantum energy.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.560]   That sounds pretty out there.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.280]   I got to say, I know it sounds a little woo woo.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.480]   What is it even?
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.640]   So it's this and how does that connect to living longer?
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.440]   It's this idea from physics, right?
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.440]   It deals with energy at like the atomic and subatomic levels.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.640]   Right.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.400]   Very, very small.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.480]   Super tiny, but the document suggests that this quantum energy might be like
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:38.160]   this key to influencing our health and vitality in ways that we're only starting
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.800]   to figure out.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.200]   Okay.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.560]   And it specifically mentions a company called Leleque.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.000]   Leleque that's developing these products.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.640]   Okay.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.880]   That are meant to like that harnesses energy.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.320]   Okay.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.480]   Color me intrigued.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.680]   But also a little skeptical healthy skepticism before we get into all the claims
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.480]   about quantum energy and what it can do and everything.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.360]   Let's back up.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.360]   Let's back up and just talk about aging.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.880]   The science of aging.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.320]   Okay.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.960]   The document talks about two types.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.600]   Intrinsic and extrinsic.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.040]   Okay.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.120]   What's the difference?
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.440]   Okay.
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.360]   So think of intrinsic aging like your internal clock.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.840]   Like that's the biological process of aging.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.040]   Just like happening at the cellular level.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.200]   Extrinsic aging is like the stuff outside the external factors.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.600]   Okay.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.800]   That's speed up that clock.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.800]   So intrinsic is like the baseline.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.880]   And then extrinsic is how we.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.520]   How you mess with it.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.880]   Mess with that.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.000]   Either speed it up or either speed it up, slow it down.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.640]   Slow down.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.080]   And the document dives into some of the really cool stuff happening
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.160]   at the cellular level.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.960]   Okay.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.680]   Like the accumulation of these senescent cells.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.320]   Senescent cells.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.400]   Now, are those the.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.760]   Yeah, they call them zombie cells.
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.880]   A zombie cell.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.840]   It's a little creepy.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.320]   Oh, no.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.360]   It's good way to describe it.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.800]   Okay.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.200]   So they basically stop dividing, but haven't died off.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.720]   So they're just kind of hanging out.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.640]   But just hanging out.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.640]   Causing trouble.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.520]   Yes, secreting harmful substances.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.560]   Disrupting normal function.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.680]   They're like squatters.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.280]   Totally.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.880]   Cellular squatters.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.240]   I like that.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.080]   Okay, so then the document goes into all these different.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.360]   Theories of aging.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.880]   Like.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.400]   Yeah, there's.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.320]   Why do we aid?
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.160]   Yeah, there's program theories.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160]   There's error theories.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:29.280]   There's even ideas about our metabolism playing a role.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.560]   But the reality is.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.600]   It's complicated.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.040]   Like aging is.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.280]   It's not just one thing.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.440]   It's not just one thing.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.040]   Which is why this whole idea of biological age is so interesting.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.640]   The document highlights the work of this.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.240]   Dr. Morgan Levine.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.200]   Dr. Morgan Levine.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.680]   And she argues that our biological age, the actual wear
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.960]   and tear on our bodies might be different from our chronological age.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.320]   It's such a key concept because it means we might actually have more
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.360]   control over how we age than we think.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.240]   So how do we how do we know what that is?
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.720]   Like is there a number?
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:12.920]   Okay.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.000]   So there's two main ways.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.400]   Okay.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.520]   One is through clinical data like blood tests.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:17.880]   Okay.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.040]   And the other is by analyzing epigenetic modifications.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.320]   Epigenetic modifications.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.240]   I know it's a mouthful.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.760]   But what does that even mean?
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.160]   Okay.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.080]   Think of it like this.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.440]   Okay.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.200]   Your DNA, that's the hardware.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   Your genes are the blueprint.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:32.720]   Okay.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.400]   And epigenetic modifications are like software updates.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:36.880]   Okay.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.680]   That can change.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.440]   How those genes are expressed.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:45.360]   So like our experiences, our choices, and actually change how our genes work.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:45.920]   Totally.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.520]   Wow.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.200]   And that's like a key takeaway from this document.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.480]   We're not just like these passive pictures of our genes.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.560]   We can actually change things.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.920]   That's empowering.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.160]   So before we get too carried away with the idea that we can hack our genes.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.040]   Right, right.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.240]   Sounds really cool.
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.360]   But let's dive into the nitty gritty.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.800]   Let's dive into the nitty gritty of how aging works.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.120]   Okay.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.240]   And the document lays out these nine hallmarks of aging.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.280]   And hallmarks, okay.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.200]   Which are these biological processes that all contribute.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.560]   Yeah, they're like the key players.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.600]   To the aging process.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.680]   So can you walk us through that?
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.080]   I can.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.280]   So first up, we have telomeretrition.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.800]   Telomeretrition.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.000]   Telomeres are like these protective caps on our chromosomes.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.680]   And they shorten as we age.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.520]   So I'm imagining those little plastic tips on shoelaces.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.480]   Exactly.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.760]   They keep things from fraying.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.960]   What happens when they get too short?
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.760]   Well, when the telomeres get too short, cells can't divide properly.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.760]   Leading to cell death.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.120]   And that contributes to aging.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.520]   Okay.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:51.920]   Got it.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.240]   All right.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:52.800]   What's next?
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.520]   What's next?
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.600]   We've got epigenetic alterations.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:55.920]   Okay.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.320]   Those are those software updates we were talking about earlier.
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.480]   That can change gene expression.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.040]   Okay.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.760]   Then there's loss of proteostasis.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.120]   Loss of proteostasis.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.800]   Which basically means our cells get worse.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.120]   Okay.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.360]   And maintaining the right balance of proteins.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.720]   And proteins are like.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.400]   The building blocks of our body.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.040]   So that sounds important.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.240]   That's kind of a big deal.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.520]   And then we have deregulated nutrient sensing.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.360]   Deregulated nutrient sensing.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.920]   Meaning our cells get less responsive.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:32.160]   To signals that tell our body how to regulate our metabolism.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.720]   So they like lose their appetite control.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.360]   Kind of yeah.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:35.760]   Okay.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.240]   And then there's mitochondrial dysfunction.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.920]   Mitochondrial dysfunction.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:40.320]   Which is.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.920]   So the mitochondria and the powerhouses.
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.600]   They're like the powerhouses.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:43.920]   Of cell.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:44.880]   Here's yeah.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.400]   They start to get less efficient.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.200]   Okay.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.960]   And that's probably why we get more tired.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.200]   Right.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.400]   So less energy.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:51.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.680]   We also have cellular senescence.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.000]   Okay.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.480]   So that's a bit.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.520]   Which we talked about earlier.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.400]   The zombie cells.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.120]   The zombie cells.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:57.360]   Yep.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.400]   They were just hanging around.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.680]   They'll squatters.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.520]   The squatters causing trouble.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:01.920]   Okay.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.920]   A stem cell exhaustion is another one.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.080]   Okay.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.720]   So that's our.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.000]   That's referring to like ability to repair.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.600]   The body's ability to repair.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.840]   So that diminishes as we age.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:12.480]   Makes sense.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.200]   Okay.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.840]   But we got left.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.320]   Two more.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:14.720]   Two more.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.200]   Okay.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.840]   Altered intercellular communication.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.320]   Okay.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.000]   So that's the communication.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:20.720]   The signals.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.280]   The story between the cells.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.480]   The crazy cells get messed up.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.640]   And last but not least.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.280]   Genomic instability.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.240]   Which is basically.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.240]   It's basically more errors.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.360]   Increase in errors.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.080]   In our DNA.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.280]   Damage to our DNA.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.360]   It's a whole cascade of events.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.160]   It's a lot.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.720]   It is a lot that's happening at the cellular level.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.360]   And it's all contributing to like.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.080]   To aging.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.040]   Aging process.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.840]   Aging, yeah.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.200]   So can we do anything about it?
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.440]   Well, that's what we're going to talk about next time.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.720]   That's what we're going to talk about next time.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.960]   We're going to delve into all the research.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.200]   On lifestyle interventions.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.520]   Cutting edge therapies.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.280]   And that really interesting idea.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.200]   Of quantum energy.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.440]   Okay.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.200]   So stay tuned.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.240]   Welcome back to our deep dive into longevity.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.520]   So before the break we were getting into like.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.960]   How aging works.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.360]   Right.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.480]   At that cellular level.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.600]   All that midi gritty.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.440]   So now for the big question.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.400]   Hit me.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.320]   Can we actually slow it down?
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.000]   This document says yes.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.880]   Okay.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.400]   A resounding yes.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:20.720]   Okay.
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.800]   So no magic potion just yet.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.440]   Not yet.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.520]   But tell me more about these lifestyle interventions.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:27.840]   Okay.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.440]   What kind of impact can those have?
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.960]   So the document highlights all this research showing.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.600]   That things like managing stress.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.560]   Getting good sleep.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.680]   You know, eating mostly plants.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.040]   A plant based diet.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.280]   Avoiding smoking and too much alcohol.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.600]   Protecting your skin from the sun.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.080]   Staying hydrated.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.720]   And regular exercise.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.720]   All play a huge role in how we age.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.040]   Okay.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.680]   So it's kind of the usual suspects.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.120]   Pretty much.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.320]   But is it like, you know,
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.760]   just adding a few healthy habits here and there?
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.400]   Or is it like you got to do a complete 180?
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.560]   The research seems to say the more the merrier you know,
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.440]   the more these healthy habits you have,
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.600]   the better the outcome.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.720]   It's really about creating like this synergy of positive choices.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.040]   Okay.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.480]   To support your body.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.800]   And it's natural repair process.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.600]   That makes sense.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.320]   It's not just like one little trick.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.200]   No quick fixes.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.640]   It's like building a foundation.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.120]   Exactly.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.160]   For the long term.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:32.880]   Yeah, it's a long game.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.160]   Some of these things though.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.920]   Like they're easier said than done.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.960]   I got to say.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.600]   For sure.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.920]   You know, I've struggled with like getting enough sleep.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.600]   And managing stress.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.640]   That's tough.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.440]   Totally.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.280]   So do you have any tips for like,
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.320]   making those changes actually stick?
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.600]   I would say.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.880]   Start small.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.560]   Be consistent.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:56.960]   Okay.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.760]   You don't got to like change everything overnight.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.080]   Right.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.440]   Just pick one or two things.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:01.760]   Okay.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.200]   Make them habits and then add another one.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:10.320]   And remember like progress, not perfection is the goal.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.320]   That's good advice.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.160]   It's a marathon, not a sprint.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.680]   I like that.
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.200]   And it kind of brings us back to that concept of health span.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.320]   Not just life span.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.560]   Not just living longer but living well.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.240]   And speaking of living well.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:24.880]   Okay.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.840]   The document spends a good amount of time talking about this company.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.160]   Okay.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.400]   Called Leela Quantum Tech.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.440]   Leela Quantum Tech.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.160]   Leela Cute.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.200]   Leela Cute got it.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.920]   And they have this whole approach to longevity.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.320]   Using this thing called quantum energy.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:42.720]   Okay.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:48.400]   So their approach is interesting because they're not just talking about like adding years.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.080]   They're really focused on enhancing health span.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.200]   And they want to do that through these products that they say can
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.520]   harness quantum energy.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:14:59.760]   Okay.
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.040]   So let's break this down.
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:01.680]   Let's do it.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.560]   We talked about quantum energy before.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:04.960]   A little bit.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:05.920]   What is it?
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.080]   All right.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.280]   So quantum energy.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.120]   It's Leela Cute saying it can impact our health.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.000]   Okay.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.720]   So it deals with energy at the atomic and subatomic level.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:16.960]   Right.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.520]   So very.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.320]   Like super tiny.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.040]   Tiny, right?
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:19.920]   Okay.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:28.000]   But they're suggesting that it can influence like our body's bio field.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.160]   Okay.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.040]   Bio field.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.400]   We're getting a little.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.440]   And now we're getting a little look.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.320]   There are you.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.000]   What is that?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.480]   Okay.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:42.400]   So imagine it as this energy field that's surrounding and going through our bodies.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.120]   You can't see it.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.240]   You can't touch it.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:44.640]   Right.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.560]   But Leela Cute is saying it's there.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.040]   Okay.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.920]   And it plays a huge role in our overall well-being.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.760]   So their idea is that by influencing this bio field with quantum energy.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.560]   Right.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.080]   We can like.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.520]   You can impact your physical health.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.320]   Improve our health.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.440]   And longevity.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.480]   And live longer.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.440]   That's the idea.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:05.760]   Okay.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.120]   They've developed a whole bunch of stuff.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.360]   Okay.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.760]   Peril gear, you know, clothing, accessories.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.320]   Okay.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.520]   Bedding devices.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:13.760]   Okay.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.640]   The quantum block.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.160]   Quantum block.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.600]   It's the infinity block.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.560]   Infinity block.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.200]   All designed to harness this energy.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:23.440]   Okay.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.200]   I got to admit, this is all sounding a bit like science fiction.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.640]   It does that little sci-fi.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.160]   It's like, I'm wearing a special shirt.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.480]   And it's helping me live longer.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.440]   Okay.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.920]   I'm definitely intrigued, but I'm also a little skeptical.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.120]   It's good to be skeptical.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.440]   Especially when it comes to this kind of stuff.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.000]   But remember we were talking about those studies.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:44.400]   Right.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:44.880]   Right.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.400]   That Leela Cute has done.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.160]   They claim to have like.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.200]   They say they have scientific evidence.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.000]   Okay.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.440]   To back up these claims.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.000]   Oh.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.800]   Oh.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.240]   They've even used dark field microscopy.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:58.640]   Okay.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.400]   Those studies were pretty interesting.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.440]   They actually showed changes in blood cells
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.840]   after using Leela Cute products.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:06.800]   It's pretty wild.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.280]   So let's get into the, how does this even work?
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.400]   How is quantum energy interacting with this bio field?
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.640]   That's where things get a little fuzzy.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.200]   Okay.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.120]   We've got research showing results.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.680]   Like those blood cell changes.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.120]   But like the exact mechanism.
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.200]   That how that's still being figured out.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.640]   So it's a little bit of a mystery.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.760]   It's kind of a mystery.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.520]   But they are seeing something happening.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.280]   There's definitely something going on.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.640]   Even if we don't fully get it.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.480]   Even if we don't totally understand it yet.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:38.960]   Okay.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.120]   So they're being upfront.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.800]   About what they don't know.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.880]   They're not claiming to have all the answers.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.200]   But what about what they do know?
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.560]   Like what are people?
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.520]   What are people saying?
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.480]   What are the benefits?
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.520]   What benefits are they getting?
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.160]   That they're seeing.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.400]   So we're hearing about increased energy.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.240]   Better sleep.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.920]   Less stress.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.240]   Even like better mental clarity.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.680]   And remember that story about the 70 year old guy?
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.960]   The 70 year old man.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.560]   Who like his senses?
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.920]   His senses were heightened.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.040]   They were just like.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.640]   After using that infinity blocks.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.440]   To be charged.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.840]   But I mean, as you said earlier.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.480]   You know, skepticism is healthy.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.280]   Yeah, it's healthy.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.560]   Those are just anecdotes, right?
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.000]   Those are just stories.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.800]   Are there like actual large studies?
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.560]   Political trials.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.600]   Lila Q says they have over 59 research studies.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.840]   On their products.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.520]   They have a whole section on their website.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.480]   You can find all the summaries and the reports.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:38.800]   Okay.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.040]   So if you want to dig into the data.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.080]   It's there.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:42.720]   It's out there.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.440]   Okay.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.520]   Let's address the elephant in the room.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.960]   There are a lot of companies.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.520]   Oh yeah.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.760]   They're a lot of companies out there.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.400]   Big promises.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.840]   Baking big promises.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.960]   About, you know.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.400]   Living longer.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.080]   Anti-aging.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.040]   Anti-aging.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.080]   Miracle cures.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.200]   Miracle cures.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.400]   So how do we know?
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.640]   Like if Lila Q is legit.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.320]   How do we know if they're the real deal?
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.280]   Right.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.720]   Or if it's just another fad.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.840]   That's a great question.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:17.280]   It's so important to be like smart consumers.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.840]   Especially when it comes to our health.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.840]   Especially when it comes to our health.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.080]   What sets Lila Q apart?
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.000]   Or at least what they say sets them apart.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.400]   Okay.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.640]   Is there focus on science?
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.880]   Like they're saying they're investing in research.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.960]   Collaborating with institutions.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.320]   And they're publishing their findings in peer review journals.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:38.720]   Okay.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.240]   So they're not just like.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.440]   They're not just relying on.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.640]   Testimonials and marketing.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.560]   They're putting their research out there.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.520]   They're putting it out there.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.640]   For people to check.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.440]   For scrutiny.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.440]   So I'm curious.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:57.840]   Have you seen any like independent research or reviews of Lila Q?
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:03.040]   I haven't dug too deep into like research specifically on Lila Q.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:03.360]   Okay.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:09.680]   But there is a growing body of research on quantum energy.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.080]   Okay.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:14.240]   And it's potential, you know, for health and wellness.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.080]   So Lila Q might be like.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.960]   They might be.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.480]   Kind of at the forefront.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.400]   They might be leading the charge.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.840]   They might be leading the charge of applying this to longevity.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.480]   Right.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.000]   But it's part of a bigger thing.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.640]   It's part of a bigger scientific exploration.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.400]   That's helpful context.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.600]   It's also important to remember that this is all.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.760]   It's a new field.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.480]   Still pretty new.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.440]   It's evolving.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.200]   There's still a lot we don't know.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.200]   We don't have all the answers yet.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.160]   So we should approach these claims with like, you know, cautious optimism.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.280]   Sausageous optimism.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.640]   And a critical eye.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.560]   Keep a critical eye.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:58.560]   But for those who are intrigued, what would you suggest as a like first step?
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.280]   I would say check out their website.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.520]   Look at the research they've published.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.920]   But most importantly, talk to your doctor.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.960]   See if these products are right for you.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.880]   That's always good advice.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.960]   It's always good to talk to your doctor.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.120]   So now let's kind of shift gears.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.680]   And talk about something that often gets overlooked.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.000]   Okay.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.680]   When we talk about living longer.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.440]   Which is mindset.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.680]   The mind-body connection.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.840]   It's so powerful.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:30.080]   So it's not just about ourselves.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.600]   It's not just about the physical stuff.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.560]   And our genes.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.920]   It's also about like,
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.280]   it's also about our thoughts.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:36.000]   What we believe.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.720]   Our beliefs.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.480]   And how we see aging.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.760]   So our thoughts.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.960]   Like actually influence our physical health.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.520]   Exactly.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.520]   There's this growing body of research showing that people who have a positive attitude about aging.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:54.080]   They tend to live longer, healthier lives.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.600]   That makes sense.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.720]   It's pretty intuitive.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.080]   But how does that work?
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:58.400]   Okay.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.000]   So it's complicated.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.800]   But for example, studies have shown that.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.560]   Chronic stress can actually shorten those telomeres.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.520]   Right.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.920]   Those protective caps on our chromosomes.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.680]   If stress can make us age faster.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.920]   Then managing stress.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.400]   Right.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.040]   And being more positive.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.120]   If you can.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:23.840]   Slow it down.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.800]   Manage the stress.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.360]   Right.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.360]   And cultivate a more positive outlook.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.600]   That could help slow things down.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.080]   But you know, it's easier said than done.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:32.640]   Right.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.520]   Especially in a society that's obsessed with youth.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.120]   And terrified of getting old.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.240]   It's a big shift.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.600]   It's a big cultural shift.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.080]   But there are things we can do individually.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:42.640]   Okay.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:48.960]   So give us some practical tips for reframing how we see getting older.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:49.600]   Okay.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.440]   One powerful practice is gratitude.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.920]   Taking time to appreciate the good things big or small.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.560]   Can shift your focus away from what you're losing.
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:04.800]   Right.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.360]   And towards what you still have.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.720]   I think it's easy.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.120]   It's easy.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.000]   It caught up.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.040]   To get caught up in that.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.640]   And the what ifs and the ifs only.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.000]   But gratitude.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.800]   But gratitude.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.560]   Kind of helps us stay grounded.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.680]   Helps you stay present.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:18.560]   In the now.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:19.360]   In the now.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.320]   I like that.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.360]   Another good strategy.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.240]   Is to try and reframe aging.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.520]   As this time of continued growth.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.800]   Learning.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.800]   And contribution.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.640]   Rather than decline.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.160]   I like that.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.680]   We can look to people.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.200]   Who are aging gracefully.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.560]   Joyfully.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.120]   Showing us that it's possible.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.800]   To live a full life.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.560]   A meaningful life.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.560]   At any age.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.320]   I love that.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.080]   Challenging those old ideas.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.120]   Those old stereotypes.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.320]   And seeing aging as like a new chapter.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.200]   A new chapter.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.400]   Not the end.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:56.960]   Not the end.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:57.680]   I like that.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.600]   And remember we're all in this together.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:00.560]   You know.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.960]   By embracing this positive
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.480]   view of aging.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.400]   We're not just helping ourselves.
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.320]   We're inspiring others.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.920]   To see it that way too.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.080]   That's a beautiful vision.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.920]   So now let's go back.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.360]   That's cutting edge research.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:15.920]   We're okay.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.880]   And explore.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.920]   An area that's showing a lot of promise.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.320]   Okay.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.120]   For targeting.
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.360]   Those innocent cells.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.400]   The zombie cells.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:24.960]   The zombie cells.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.760]   Remember those.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.880]   You're talking about synolytics.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.440]   Synolytics.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.760]   So we know they're there.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.640]   Pusing trouble.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.760]   Hanging out.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.640]   Contributing to.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.040]   Aging.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.520]   So what are synolytics?
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:35.760]   Okay.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.720]   So synolytics.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.520]   And how do they work?
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.760]   Are a type of drug.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.600]   Designed.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.040]   To get rid of those cells.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.680]   Like specifically target
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.040]   and eliminate those cells.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.320]   So they clear out all of them.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.360]   They clear out the.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.400]   Cellular junk.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.040]   The junk.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:53.840]   The debris.
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:54.960]   That makes us age.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.560]   That's contributing to aging.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.040]   So is this a real fountain of youth?
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.320]   We're not quite there yet.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:00.880]   Okay.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.280]   Research is pretty promising.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:03.840]   Okay.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.280]   Studies in animals.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:12.400]   Have shown that synolytics can help with all kinds of age-related issues.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.440]   You know, frailty.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.280]   Muscle weakness.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.440]   Heart problems.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.600]   Even cognitive decline.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:19.920]   Wow.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.080]   That's impressive.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.280]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.960]   But what about humans?
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.720]   Human trials.
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.800]   Or started testing it on people.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:31.840]   They're underway.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.880]   And the early results are encouraging.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.360]   Okay.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.600]   For example, there was a small study on patients
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.400]   with this lung disease called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.160]   Serious condition.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:46.800]   Okay.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.840]   Often linked to aging.
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.240]   And they found that using two synolytic drugs together
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.320]   actually improved physical function and reduced inflammation.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.560]   Wow.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.680]   So there's hope.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.320]   Yeah, there's hope that this could actually help.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.000]   The goal is to help people.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.440]   People with all kinds of...
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.400]   Yeah, with all sorts.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.280]   Age-related diseases.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.880]   Age-related diseases.
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.880]   That's amazing.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.160]   And the research is moving quickly.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.840]   Lots of companies are developing different synolytic drugs.
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.160]   We're probably going to see more human trials soon.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.760]   But of course, with any new drug or therapy.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.880]   Yeah, there are always risks.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.680]   There are always risks and potential side effects.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.640]   We got to be careful.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.760]   We got to be careful.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.640]   So we need a lot more research.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.680]   More research.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.280]   Make sure it's safe.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.120]   Before it's, you know.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:37.760]   And then it works.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.880]   Available to everybody.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.880]   We don't want to, you know.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.840]   We want to jump the gun.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.320]   Jump the gun.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.760]   But it is exciting to think that maybe one day
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.200]   we could target those zombie cells
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.760]   and actually slow down.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.000]   Or even reverse aging.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.320]   Yeah, it's a whole new way of thinking about aging.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.960]   It's not just about treating symptoms.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.720]   It's about tackling the root cause.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.120]   It's a whole new way of thinking about it.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.080]   Totally.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.600]   And it's a reminder that longevity is about more than just.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.800]   It's about more than just the physical.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.920]   Our physical bodies.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.120]   It's also about our minds.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.080]   Our minds.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:18.960]   Life styles.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.520]   And really like embracing the aging process.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.320]   Yeah, embracing it with curiosity and optimism.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.360]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.840]   So speaking of optimism.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.240]   Let's move on to another area of longevity research.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:32.800]   Okay.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.720]   That's, that's really exciting.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.720]   The microbiome.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.320]   Ah, the microbiome.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.520]   Now that's the community of bacteria.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.840]   Yeah, all those little microorganisms.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.640]   Other stuff.
[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.840]   Yeah, living in our gut.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.720]   Living in our gut.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.640]   What does that have to do with aging?
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.280]   You might be surprised to learn that our gut microbiome.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:59.360]   Is super important for our health and how long we live.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.240]   I had no idea.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.760]   Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.000]   Okay.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:02.720]   Tell me more.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.040]   Okay.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.600]   So our gut microbiome.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:12.000]   It's like this whole ecosystem of trillions of microorganisms.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:12.240]   Wow.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.360]   That's a lot.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.000]   It's a lot.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.400]   Okay.
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.360]   And they influence so many things.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:23.440]   Digestion, immune function, mood, cognitive function.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.080]   Wow, I had no idea.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.200]   Yeah, it's a big deal.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.480]   It was so powerful.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.520]   Okay.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.040]   And here's the thing.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:38.000]   As we get older, the makeup of our gut microbiome, it can change.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.400]   And those changes can lead to imbalances, which can then lead to inflammation,
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.840]   disease, and even faster aging.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:51.760]   So a healthy gut is essential for healthy aging.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.640]   For healthy aging.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.200]   What can we do locally to keep our gut healthy as we age?
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:02.160]   A lot of the things we can do to support gut health.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.760]   Are things we should be doing anyway?
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.400]   Okay, I'm ready.
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.600]   Give me the gut health checklist.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:05.840]   All right.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.080]   Number one, diet is key.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.280]   What should we be eating?
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:16.240]   Eat lots of fiber, fruits, vegetables,
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.320]   fermented foods.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:23.040]   Those can really nourish the good bacteria in your gut.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.880]   Okay, so lots of veggies and kimchi.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.920]   Exactly.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.720]   Kimchi is great.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:27.760]   What else?
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.680]   Managing stress.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:36.400]   Stress can really mess with the balance of our gut microbiome.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.720]   Stress seems to be like a common thread.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.760]   It's a common thread.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.800]   Yeah, with so many.
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.800]   Yeah, and so many health challenges.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:47.840]   And lastly, avoiding unnecessary antibiotics.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:52.640]   So antibiotics, they're great for fighting infection.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:58.400]   But they can also kill off the good bacteria along with the bad.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.640]   Okay, so only use them.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.240]   Yeah, only when you really need them.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.520]   And you really need them, yeah.
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.040]   Yeah, anything else we should know?
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:12.880]   There's this growing interest in fecal microbiota transplantation.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.640]   Fecal microbiota transplantation.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.440]   Yeah, FMT.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.000]   What is that?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.960]   Okay, so it's basically transferring poop.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.760]   Okay.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.200]   From a healthy person to someone else's gut.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.680]   I'm trying to be...
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.760]   I know, it sounds good out there.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.760]   But poop transplants, expert speaker.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:39.600]   We're back and ready to wrap up our deep dive into longevity.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.120]   Yeah, it's been a fascinating journey.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.720]   We've covered so much.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.680]   So much ground.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.640]   From the basics of how aging works.
[00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.120]   To all this cutting edge research.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.080]   All the new stuff.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.720]   Yeah, like, senolytics, the microbiome.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.080]   And right before the break, we were talking about epigenetics.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.480]   Right, epigenetics, how our choices can...
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:03.120]   Yeah, and how our choices can actually turn certain genes on or off.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.160]   It's wild, right?
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.440]   Yeah, it's really wild, so...
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.840]   Like, we have so much more control than we think.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.520]   Yeah, I'm curious.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:15.920]   Beyond the usual advice, like diet, exercise, stress management.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.960]   Right, the basics.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.880]   Are there other things coming up that could really change the game?
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.440]   Yeah, there are a few things that are really exciting.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.160]   One of them is epigenetic reprogramming.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.840]   Epigenetic reprogramming.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.960]   Okay, that sounds like really sci-fi.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.840]   It's cutting edge.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.800]   What is that?
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:39.280]   Okay, so it basically involves using molecules or gene editing tools
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.520]   to actually reset the epigenetic clock.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.400]   So it's kind of like...
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.480]   It's like hitting the undo button.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.520]   Hitting undo on some of the changes.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.040]   Yeah, on those epigenetic changes.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.080]   It'll happen as we age.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.440]   That build up over time.
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.240]   Wow.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.920]   Are we talking about like turning back time,
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.120]   Benjamin Button style?
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.280]   We're not quite there yet.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:01.600]   Okay.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.480]   But the research is super promising.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.040]   Okay.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.800]   Early studies have shown.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.840]   You can actually reverse some of the signs of aging in cells and tissues.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.120]   That's amazing.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.240]   It's pretty wild.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:19.280]   Okay, so what other breakthroughs are on the horizon?
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.440]   Another really interesting area is using AI.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.000]   AI.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.200]   Artificial intelligence.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.640]   AI for aging.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.240]   Okay, tell me more.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:32.480]   And machine learning to personalize longevity interventions.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.600]   So imagine you give a blood sample.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.160]   Okay.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.120]   For saliva sample.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:42.080]   And an algorithm analyzes it, looks at your genes,
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:48.320]   your epigenetics, your lifestyle data, and then it creates a plan.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.800]   Just for you.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.360]   Wow.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.960]   So it's not just one size fits all?
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.840]   Not one size fits all.
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.920]   It's a personalized longevity plans.
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:56.880]   Longevity plans.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.160]   Just for you.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.920]   That's amazing.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:05.200]   And these algorithms could help us find new ways to extend lifespan.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.720]   And predict how different things will affect us.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.160]   That's really cool.
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.120]   That's pretty futuristic.
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:14.880]   But with all this talk about, you know, living longer.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.120]   I wonder if we're kind of forgetting something important.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.120]   Yeah, but what's the meaning of it all?
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.440]   What's the meaning of a longer life?
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:23.760]   Right.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:29.440]   Because extending lifespan without thinking about meaning and purpose
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:33.200]   could just lead to a bunch of bored people.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.640]   So it's not just about...
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.720]   It's not just about adding years.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.440]   Adding years.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.680]   It's about adding life to those years.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:45.440]   So how do we make sure that a longer life is actually good life?
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.520]   I think it starts with a growth mindset.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.000]   Okay.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.120]   Embracing learning.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:56.240]   And staying connected to what we love, what we're passionate about.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.480]   So we need to find ways to contribute.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.040]   Contribute.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.080]   Build relationships.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:00.560]   Like, yeah.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.080]   And keep exploring.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.200]   That's exactly.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:03.840]   I love that.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.200]   It's a gift, you know?
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:05.600]   It is.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.480]   To live longer.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.680]   But we have to...
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.880]   We have to use it wisely.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.320]   Yeah, we have to use it wisely.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.760]   This deep dive has been incredible.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.320]   It has been.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.040]   We went from like the tiniest cells.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.920]   Yeah, the nitty gritty.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.920]   To like what it means for society.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.720]   The big picture.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.880]   So as we wrap up, here's a final thought.
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:25.760]   Okay.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:32.880]   If you could live a lot longer, what would you do with that extra time?
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.400]   What would you accomplish?
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.600]   Yeah, what kind of legacy would you want to leave?
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.040]   It's a good question to think about.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:45.280]   Let it fuel your curiosity and inspire you to live each day to the fullest.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.080]   I love that.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.520]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.480]   Thanks for being here.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:50.640]   On this deep dive into longevity.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.920]   Until next time.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.560]   Yeah.
