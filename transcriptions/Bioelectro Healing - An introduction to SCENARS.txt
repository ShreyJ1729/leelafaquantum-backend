[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.920]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and in this video, part of my bioelectrohealing series is on
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.920]   Cenars.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.680]   So, of the dozens of different bioelectrical magnetic devices that I have, I do get asked
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.360]   every now and then if I could only have one device, which one would it be?
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.640]   And you know, the answer is, I would want a Cenar.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.880]   And let me tell you why.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.800]   However, before we jump into that, let's talk about disclaimers.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.600]   I do not recommend or endorse any specific tests, physicians, procedures, opinions, or
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.360]   other information that may be mentioned in this video.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.880]   Nor make any claims intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.920]   Reliance on any information appearing and discussing this video solely at everyone's
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.920]   own risk.
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.800]   Statements may have not been evaluated by the EFSA, FDA, or any government derivative thereof.
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.200]   Caution, do not use any bioelectrical magnetic devices if you have an electrical implant
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.320]   in your body or if you are pregnant.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.920]   Okay, there just isn't enough research done on the pregnancy aspect and you certainly
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.740]   do not want to be zapping yourself with electricity if you have an electrical implant.
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.660]   All right, so let's talk about what is a Cenar.
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.840]   Well, the Cenar is actually an acronym and it stands for self-controlled ergo-neuroadaptive
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.840]   regulator.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.360]   So, you know, try to say that five times fast.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.640]   And in a nutshell, it's basically an electrotherapeutic medical device, right?
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.160]   It's a combination of three different modalities in this, you know, healing space and devices
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.480]   made to heal people that use electricity batteries, so forth.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:48.480]   And what it is, it's a combination of biofeedback frequency and PMF, which is the pulse electromagnetic
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.480]   frequency.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.880]   Okay, so it's pulsed frequency tied to biofeedback.
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.040]   And how that really kind of comes together is the idea of biofeedback.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.800]   This is what makes it extremely unique in this field of bioelectral healing.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   It's the only device that does that or devices.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.560]   And what that means is if you've ever had a biofeedback session or if you're familiar
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.200]   with biofeedback, basically you're connected to a machine that's going to measure your
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.720]   brainwaves.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.000]   And based on, and there's two ways to do it, you can voluntarily, as you are, you know,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.120]   trying to manipulate your waves, you know, consciously, you can see the results on a
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.120]   screen.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.360]   And that's voluntarily, you're interacting with that thing and you are in control.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.480]   But a CNR is actually using biofeedback from a reflexive standpoint where it's basically
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.640]   going to send impulses to your brain and then your brain's going to interact with it.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.080]   And by the way your brain interacts with the device, it reads those interactions.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.100]   And then it compensates and determines what is the appropriate frequency to use for whatever
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.640]   situation that you're presenting the device.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.880]   So it's pretty high tech.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.240]   And you know, what's amazing, this stuff was developed back in the 70s and 80s.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.360]   And it's a Russian invention.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.240]   It was produced by those guys.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.560]   And the story goes, and I've never been able to find any validation of this story, but
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.760]   the story goes that the technology was developed by the Russians for the cosmonaut program
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.880]   because you can't send a pharmacy up into space along with your astronauts, or in this
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.640]   case your cosmonauts, right?
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.480]   You just can't send the whole pharmacy.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.280]   So they developed a device that could do a lot of different things from a health and
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.280]   wellness medical standpoint that the cosmonauts could take with them in a little handheld
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.320]   device such as you're seeing on the screen.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.120]   So that was kind of like the story.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.960]   And again, I haven't been able to validate that and I really did look.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.360]   But the idea is there, okay, it's a handheld device that actually can treat and cure different
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.360]   issues.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.760]   And it's exceptionally geared towards pain management.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.240]   But then, you know, it's over time, it's been expanded to do a lot more.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.960]   So it really ties again, I want to point out this one really important point is this biofeedback,
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.960]   which is what makes it really, really unique.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.000]   So you put the device onto your skin, it starts talking to your brain, it figure out what's
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.760]   wrong at that moment, at that little place you're putting it, the probe or the electrode,
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.760]   and then it's going to go and figure out how to treat you.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.520]   So that's the key here is it's got diagnostics capability by literally interfacing with your
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.520]   brain.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.640]   So and then once it knows what it's, what your brain needs to do and your brain and the
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.440]   device are talking to each other, then it stimulates your natural body processes for
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.640]   cellular repair via neural singling, okay.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.640]   And that's what it does.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.320]   So it stimulates your natural process.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.440]   And I can get into a lot about wound healing and injury healing and how seen ours work.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.720]   I'm really going to try to keep this video reasonably lengthy or short, sorry, you know,
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.280]   because there's so much I could talk about regarding these devices and I've got a lot
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.920]   of content that I think it's very valuable and very helpful.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.960]   So I am going to try to be high level, okay, about about the situation or about this topic,
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.960]   okay.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.360]   So, but that's what it does, you know, it talks to your brain and it stimulates your
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.120]   own brain's ability to control your body and then it starts the healing process.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.680]   And that's what's amazing about this thing.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.960]   And it's even more importantly, it's a non drug solution.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.640]   There are no side effects if you adhere to the cautions, okay, but that's the key here
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.200]   is that this is a parallel modality, medical treatment modality that is parallel to the
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   pharmaceutical industry, but there's no side effects and it runs off electricity.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.200]   I mean, think about that.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.160]   You buy one and you're in control.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.080]   You don't have to keep going back or keep being experimented on, you know, but it's
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.040]   a non drug and that's what appeals to me first and foremost.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.040]   You know what?
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.120]   And it also is an FDA cleared device.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.420]   Now, some of these products and there's multiple different manufacturers in Russia that produce
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.120]   these devices.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.120]   And now some of them have actually been FDA cleared under the TENS guideline, which is
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:26.100]   a different type of bioelectrical device called a TENS, I'll get in that in a second, but
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.120]   and under that classification is for, you know, bioelectrics for pain management, some
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.720]   seen our manufacturers have been cleared by the FDA as a class two medical device.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   And because of that, there are some sellers out there that will require a prescription
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.080]   to purchase one, but the majority of them, you do not need a prescription.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.000]   You can just go and buy yourself one, okay?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.800]   But because it's been FDA cleared, some of them have, then some of those require prescription.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.440]   So just, you know, something to know.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:02.280]   Now, I think it's really important to point out, you know, what seen ours are not, okay?
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.560]   It's been in terms of pointing out what is a CNR, but what is not a CNR?
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.440]   And that's what's really important because of this area of, you know, healing therapy
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.000]   and things like that, devices that go along with it.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.600]   There's so many different types that it's really easy to get confused.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.520]   If you're not like living it like I do, it's my thing, right?
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.960]   And so what I want to really point out, it was what it's not and what it's not.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.720]   It's not a TENS device and this is what a TENS device is right here and it's just a
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.320]   little, cheapy thing you could buy for 40 bucks on Amazon, okay?
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.120]   And it stands for the TENS, TENS, retranscutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.720]   And it's just, all it's going to do is put out a frequency, I'm sorry, you know, I'm
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.720]   sorry, a frequency.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.520]   It's going to put out a voltage that you turn up and down and then it's basically going
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.120]   to numb out your muscles and it just, and that's how you control the pain.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.520]   It doesn't heal you, it doesn't cure anything, it just numbs you out so you don't feel the
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.520]   pain.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.520]   And, and for those of you who understand pain management, sometimes you don't want to be
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.320]   doing that because pain is your body's way of telling you, let me heal.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.920]   Okay, so, but that's what a TENS unit is.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.680]   There's also different devices called an EMS, which is electronic muscle stimulation.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.080]   That's one of these guys.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.240]   And these guys are basically primarily used for to reverse the effects of atrope, you
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.280]   know, like if you break your leg and it's in a cast for three months, you know, it shrinks.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.640]   And so you want to stimulate it, you know, with electrical pulses to kind of build your
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.200]   muscle mass back up.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.240]   And that's what these are used for in the medical field.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.720]   And there's FSM, which is frequency specific microcurrent.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.360]   You go to a practitioner, chiropractor, whatever, who's using one of these devices to hook you
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.360]   up with.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.200]   And it's basically going to be pumping in frequencies at low voltage.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.200]   That's not a CNR.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.960]   And then of course, you know, you've got these pads, you've got these little ring things
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.200]   and that's postal retro magnetic frequency and it's a different type of modality.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   And again, my point here is that there's all these different types.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.520]   But these are not C-nars, okay?
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.040]   So if it doesn't say C-nars, it's not a C-nars.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.520]   And I think, you know, that's common sense, but it's easy to get confused because they
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.520]   all kind of look alike, right?
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:14.040]   But keep in mind that the key difference is this biofeedback, okay, you know, circuitry
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:19.680]   in the device and its ability to deliver, you know, basically a frequency specific PMF
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.680]   pulse.
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.000]   And so it's not one of these, it's a C-nars.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And that's all.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.360]   Let's just leave it at that.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.240]   Okay, now what I think this is what's going to be the meat of the issue here for this
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.720]   preso is, is what are the technical specifications?
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.640]   Specifically, I want to try to answer for anyone who's interested is, you know, what
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:44.760]   are the technical specs of a C-nars, specifically to how does a C-nars work?
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.120]   What can you treat with a C-nars?
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.640]   And then how do you use a C-nars, okay?
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.360]   So I think what I'd like to do is walk you through, and this is for anyone who's interested
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.800]   in buying one of these devices, and I'll go through the price ranges.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:03.440]   But the whole idea, though, is that if you want to learn about one of these, you know,
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:09.720]   go to the user guide, just go Google, or duck, duck, go, whatever you use, but go and find
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:15.000]   the user manual for this thing, whichever device you're going to get, and read the manual.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.960]   Okay, because that is the absolute best place to learn, and I'm going to walk you through
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:25.480]   three different devices that I have that, and the English manuals that came with them.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:30.000]   Now, just be aware that if you buy all of these things that are Russian-made, so you
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.240]   most likely will get a Russian manual in the box, and then the seller will then email
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.520]   you the English version of that, and it's been around for so long that you can always
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.880]   just find the English version on the internet, and that's what these are.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:48.280]   So I'm going to walk you through, and I have a C-nars device that's called a Chan C-nars.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:54.280]   I have this specific device, which is the Home Model, which is the Model D, Sport D.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:59.400]   I have two of these, one for I gave my daughter, and then this was actually one of the first
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.080]   ones that I got, and it's a much older version.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.360]   I've been using C-nars well over 10 years, so this is like one of the very oldest ones
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:12.680]   I own, and it's definitely got some miles on it, and then here's the manuals that came
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.680]   with that.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.880]   I'll walk you through that, and then I sort of started tinkering around with this other
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.440]   model from a different company called the NAS, and this is the PCM6, and the manuals
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.120]   that came with that, I'll walk you through that, and then most recently, I've sort of
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:31.360]   led in the last, I don't know, year or two, have upgraded to a different class of C-nars
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.000]   called the Bio-Modulator that comes along with this thing called a Bio-Transducer.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.160]   So let me walk you through that, because I think where the answers to these questions
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.280]   are going to lie is really going to be in these manuals, and this is where the meat of
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.440]   the issue really comes through.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.320]   So here's the manual, and to answer the very first question, this is the manual on the
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:57.120]   C-nars, the RITM, or the C-nars Chans-C-nars, and to really answer the first question, which
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.480]   is how do these things work?
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.000]   Okay, now, I'm not going to get too much into the technical specs, because we could
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.800]   spend hours on that, but I think the easiest thing to do is just look at the manual and
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:12.840]   say, okay, well, let's just kind of go down to where it talks specifically about it, and
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.440]   which is kind of cool, because this manual really gets into the technical specs.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.360]   I mean, we're talking electrical circuitry and so forth, but what I want to point out
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:26.680]   is the idea that it's a PEMF device, okay, and it's got amplitude and voltage and a
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.480]   level of microamps, voltage, and amplitude.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.960]   That's going to basically be the pulse that's going to go into you.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.680]   So one of the things I do notice about the user manuals, they don't get into how the
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:44.080]   biofeedback thing works, but it really focuses on how does that frequency specific PEMF aspect
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.600]   of the device work.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.760]   And again, what I mean by that is you're getting a pulse of electrons, right, at a very specific
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.600]   frequency and a very specific power level.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.600]   That's it.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.560]   That's really what, you know, I'm sorry I get if I'm using terminology that I haven't
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.640]   defined, but that's what I mean by that, which is in here's basically the amplitude.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.320]   So if you, if you don't know if you ever watched my first video, my intro to my bio-electrical
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:13.880]   magnetic devices where I talked about hummers versus ringers, uh, C-nars are ringers, okay?
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.680]   And that just simply means that the pulse coming at you is just a pop and then it goes
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:23.280]   down versus a device that is just going to play a tune to you like, you know, right,
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.560]   and you're just getting that frequency over this, you know, it's going to stay set the
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.720]   same over a period of time versus a pop, and then it just drops down.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.720]   And that's what you're getting.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:37.900]   That pulse, that at PEMF pulse, and as you, as you can see from the specs, uh, depending
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:43.520]   on the model that you get, um, I've got the home D right now, which so, um, this is, this
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.520]   is my oldest one, right?
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:49.720]   And then it has a 90 Hertz plus or minus 10% on the frequency range, uh, right here.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.800]   Uh, and then of course you've got, uh, well, that's the stimuli frequency and then you've
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:59.440]   got your regular frequencies that the machine, uh, the device uses, again, a cycle modulation,
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.680]   how fast it comes and, you know, all that kind of stuff.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.680]   So, you know, and that's kind of it right there.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:10.600]   And then if you look at, uh, the PCMS, uh, PCMS, uh, CM six, uh, it also has, uh, its
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:17.120]   own, uh, set in the user manual where it actually shows you the specifications in terms of minimum
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.920]   and maximum amplitude, uh, and so forth.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.200]   And I don't know how many of you, you know, folks are really into this kind of thing,
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   but if you are the specs are here and it'll tell you exactly what frequencies, uh, it,
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.160]   it's capable of delivering and how strong of a frequency it can deliver.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.480]   So that's the concept of how it works.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   Okay.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.720]   Now what I think for most of us, I'd say 99.99 and I, and I'm clearly one of them is,
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.400]   you know, I really don't really get too deep into the nerdy number thing.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.640]   Uh, I'm really like, okay, well, you know, what is it treat?
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.080]   I mean, what, what can I use it for?
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.240]   That's really where I'm coming from the majority of the time.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.980]   So when you look at the, what can you use it for, uh, and it's a separate manual, uh,
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.520]   for the, uh, chance scene are, uh, I, you know, one of the things that this guy was
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.600]   like, this is like one of my oldest manuals and, and, but what's really cool though, is
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.520]   it really lists out, uh, exactly like right here for the lay users, recommendations for
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:15.480]   lay users, you know, starting on page 15 and, uh, oh, hey, uh, I should have mentioned
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.480]   this.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.920]   By the way, uh, everything you're seeing in this video, I put on Google Drive and different
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.980]   folders, uh, and the, the link's going to be in the video description below.
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:31.840]   So everything you're seeing, feel free, grab a copy and you can just read it at your, uh,
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.760]   leisure and, and be able to just kind of study it on your own.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.200]   So, you know, feel free to do your own research.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.400]   Everything you see is going to be in those folders on Google Drive for you.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.400]   Okay.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.400]   Uh, so we're in this, uh, chance scene, our, uh, manual page 15 and this is what it does.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.520]   This is what I am most interested in, which is what does this thing treat?
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.760]   Uh, you know, scene, our, this specific model, right?
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.000]   Different models can do different things.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Okay.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   That's very important.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.480]   Uh, and so basically, you know, you can get, uh, analgesic, they're, I'm sorry, analgesic
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.720]   therapy, which is your pain, right?
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.320]   Uh, trauma treatments, you get burns, fractures, breaks, contusions, things like that.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.520]   You can get, uh, these things can treat, uh, respiratory, uh, issues, anti-adema issues,
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.520]   uh, you know, bad bruising, uh, and then you get into neurological diseases where you
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.760]   can see where all these different types of, uh, diseases are listed here in terms of,
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:29.840]   uh, you know, cranial type of issues, uh, motor muscle issues, uh, you know, you can
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.920]   even, it's interesting we get into this whole vegetative and, and you could use it as an
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.920]   emergency device.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:40.320]   Um, you know, I'll get later into that, but then, uh, also arthritis and tendinitis and
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.560]   then cardiovascular and you can just, it goes on and on.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:50.040]   It goes into ENT, tonsillitis and gastrointestinal, I guess, intestinal, sorry, dental, urinary
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.120]   tract, gynecological and so forth and so forth.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.960]   And that's really the range and, you know, as you can see, there's quite a range of different
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:06.800]   ailments, diseases, injuries, just day to day pain, uh, that senors are applicable for.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   And you know what?
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:14.120]   I just got to say this that, and if you don't, if you don't know is the senors are so embedded
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.880]   into the Russian medical system that there are senor clinics everywhere and that you
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.580]   can literally go and instead of you going to your pill popper, pill pusher, uh, white
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:28.600]   coat person that you unfortunately deal with every now and then you could in Russia, you
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.760]   go to these senor clinics and they just like, you know, treat you with senors, uh, if you
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.560]   can't afford your own home one and that's it.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.280]   And so they, it's a whole nother world over there in terms of how they, how they look
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:44.160]   at the medical field, uh, and, and you know, they're not opposed to using, uh, things that
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.560]   are not tied to drugs, which is very important nowadays.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.560]   Okay.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.040]   So that's the, uh, what does it do, uh, in terms of the list of things that it can do?
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.600]   And then, and then how do you use them and tied to?
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.080]   So this is like the best example of, of the list of things it could do, but I want to
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.640]   kind of walk you through the third question now, which is how to use these devices for
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.960]   all this stuff.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.440]   So when you, we start getting into that, um, you know, like let's take a look at the,
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.600]   this is the Chan senor.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:17.300]   Again, this is a, uh, when I upgraded my old one for my new one, I use, well, you know,
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:23.080]   if I, if you go back to, um, whoop, this one here, uh, I have the older model and I have
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.560]   the newer one that looks just like it, it gets confusing.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:33.240]   Uh, and so the newer one came with, and they started coming out with a color, um, user
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.140]   manuals, uh, you know, a few years ago.
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.640]   And so the color one is a lot nicer.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.640]   Uh, it's easy.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.320]   And so they really give you some, uh, really good diagrams by which you can kind of take
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.680]   a look at the treatment methods, like how do I use this in combination with what it does?
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.120]   So now the manual say, okay, this is what it does.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.480]   And then this is what to do with it, uh, with the device and how do you treat that?
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:56.040]   And it kind of shows you where to place the electrodes, how to do it, the, you know, in
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.120]   terms of just how do you actually use it?
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.520]   Uh, and then also in terms of just, uh, all the different types of, uh, accessories that
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:08.600]   come with it as well as again, you know, specific, like where exactly, what specific points do
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.640]   you need to place the electrode at?
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.560]   How long do you place it there, uh, depending on the ailment that you're actually trying
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.640]   to address?
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.560]   So it's really kind of like, you know, you can see where the, where the user manual's
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:24.400]   got a lot, uh, more comprehensive over time in terms of helping out, uh, you understand
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.720]   how to use these devices.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:31.640]   There's also, um, this device radar, I talked about the PCMS, uh, six, that's that other
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.640]   one.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.640]   And you know what?
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.400]   I got to tell you, this guy right here is, uh, the most reset, like it's one of the newer
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.120]   models that came out a couple of years ago, um, and you know what?
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.280]   It's by far of all of the different, uh, scene hours that I have, I think I have like six
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:51.060]   or seven, uh, this one is, um, the easiest one to use.
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.400]   It's also the least expensive one.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.320]   You could buy the actual unit for about 200 and accessories for an extra hundred.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.240]   So for like under 400 bucks roughly, you could have a full kit.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.240]   Um, and you definitely want the accessories with this guy.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.200]   It's designed for those accessories, which is what's really cool.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.360]   Um, and so, uh, this guy is really super easy to use.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.160]   It's a really good entry model.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.640]   It's got a really good documentation and you can kind of see right here where, you know,
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.760]   uh, you know, I like this guy a lot, uh, because you know, it's like, it's got this
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.200]   little screen and you could look at the screen right here.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:28.640]   This is a picture of the screen and it says, hey, do this, you know, like very, very visual.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.120]   Do this for this law and then it automatically sets the duration, it automatically sets the
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.120]   power level.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.960]   Uh, well, you actually have to set the power level, but it sets the duration for you and
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.200]   you just pick, I have an allergy, I want to treat the allergy in it and it shows you in
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.720]   a picture where to put the probes, right?
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.120]   Let me just keep going down here.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.080]   See if they got any more examples of what the screen looks like.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.840]   I'll find it.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.840]   I thought I saw it.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.920]   Here's the, here's the different, uh, pads that I have.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.960]   Um, and I thought I saw, oh yeah, here you go.
[00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.120]   And so this is where you would put the probes, you put it on the back of your neck, you put
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:06.360]   it along this mid band, uh, and then you set the thing for, I got allergies or if you've
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.560]   got lower abdominals, this is the, this is the area you want to treat.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.560]   And you just pick it.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.800]   You just pick what your problem is and then it shows you these pictures on the screen,
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.920]   wear on your body to place it and you just do it till it beeps at you.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:19.920]   It's so simple.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.480]   Uh, so yeah, this is a really great model and, and, and, uh, you know, I recommend all
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.480]   of this stuff.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.240]   So it's really going to be depending on your budget and, and what you really want to try
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.840]   to cure, treat, right?
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.880]   And how you're going to find out what you're going to cure or treat or which one works
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.880]   for what?
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.880]   Look at the manuals.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:37.880]   Okay.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.240]   So now the other one that I want to talk about in terms of, uh, uh, well, this is the, the
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:47.320]   bio modulator, uh, specifications, uh, again, just kind of revisiting the idea of, you know,
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.120]   like, if you want to know what the specs are, here you go.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.920]   It gives you the power output, frequency, voltage, current and all that.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:56.280]   But instead let's talk more about like, what do you use it for?
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:02.080]   And so this, the thing about tenant now, uh, is, is their senars, they don't call them
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.080]   senars.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:09.960]   They call them bio modulators, um, and, um, the information for bio modulators is not
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.320]   all in one manual.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.320]   Okay.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.960]   Uh, which makes it a little challenging to learn.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:20.560]   Uh, and so it's about, I would say about half of the stuff you want to know is in a
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   manner.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.920]   Maybe I'd say that's, that's kind of excessive.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.920]   Let's be honest.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:30.480]   20% of what you want to know is going to be written in a manual and the eight of 80% is
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:37.120]   in videos that they, and then you get, uh, three sets of, uh, of educational, uh, opportunities
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.680]   to learn this stuff.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.320]   Um, and they have this online, uh, university, which is awesome.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.760]   And so that would probably get you about halfway there in terms of becoming really, really
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.760]   proficient.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.560]   Uh, was just watching the videos, read all the guides.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.160]   This is the guide, uh, you're seeing right here.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.520]   And then the rest of it though, you know, is going to be paid for.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.280]   Like if you want to get proficient, like really, really like a practitioner level proficient
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:05.360]   at everything that a bio modulator can do, uh, you would need to take the advanced courses
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.840]   and they do charge for that.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.760]   And so that's, so that's their business model, which is a little different than let's say
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:15.520]   you go and buy a PCM six, uh, it comes with the manual and then some of the, some of the
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.760]   training videos are free.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.120]   Some of them you have to pay for if you want to become really, really proficient.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.120]   Okay.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:26.320]   So one of the things though, this is the bio modulator, um, a, a scene are okay.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:31.080]   And it will also the quick start guide will tell you exactly, not exactly, but it'll tell
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:35.000]   you and give you some guidance as to, you know, how to use the machine, which is very
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   handy.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.040]   This also got its own set of accessories, but you know, this is probably just the fact
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.120]   that they did it like this, uh, it made it, for me, the easiest thing to use, um, to learn
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.120]   how to use.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:52.480]   Uh, as opposed to, you know, reading, uh, the PCM six manual, which is 216 pages.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:57.040]   Uh, uh, the quick start guides for the bio module, there's only 61 pages.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.880]   So I could, you know, bang through that in a night.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.840]   Uh, but then, but you know, same thing, right?
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.920]   It shows you where the points are, whether you want to put it on depending on what your
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.920]   issues are.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.600]   Like, if I want to treat the gallbladder, here's the points for that.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.680]   If I want to treat, you know, the stomach, this is the point, uh, if I want to treat
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.440]   the small intestine, that's the point, which is strange, but it's how it works.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.960]   Uh, and then that sort of thing.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.240]   So then, you know, here you want to, your parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system,
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:22.880]   you want to reset that, uh, then you want to go ahead and this is the point right here,
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.560]   this, this range right in here is what you want to treat, uh, that sort of thing.
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.560]   And then for different conditions.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.520]   So you can kind of see how, um, you know, it's really helpful.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.520]   It's got a lot of pictures.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.880]   I need pictures to learn something and this is such a very helpful thing.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.800]   Uh, and then one of the most, the coolest thing about the, uh, bio-modulator, and it's
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:45.360]   really much more advanced than, than the PCM six or the, the chance CNR and the reason
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.040]   I got a bio-modulator is that it's really, in my personal opinion, it is the most advanced
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:54.080]   CNR you, on the market as of now for home use.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.080]   Okay.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:02.200]   Um, and because the, uh, the guy that invented the, uh, the bio-modulator, Dr.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.680]   Jerry Tenet, and he's also the author of healing is with the voltage.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.720]   The guy is a freaking legend and in my end world, you know, the bio-electrical magnetic
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:18.520]   world, he's a legend and he, he saw the potential of a CNR and he also had a deep, deep understanding
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:23.720]   of, of the concept of how our body works as it relates to voltage.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:30.480]   So he had a CNR that was made by a company called, uh, a visa and he had it customized
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:37.520]   into a bio-modulator by combining body voltage measurement and charging with a CNR.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:43.160]   So his CNR, which is called the Tenet bio-modulator, this guy right here.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:49.120]   This thing, his CNR, um, is, is, is everything a CNR, it could be, right?
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:55.880]   The bio-feedback frequency and PMF plus it's got an extra feature that other CNRs don't
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:02.280]   have, which is body voltage, uh, measurement and body voltage charging.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.880]   And so you could literally use this thing to charge up, uh, and you know, cause your
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.360]   body, your battery, you know, you guys are, saw the movie matrix, right?
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.640]   Well, that was actually true.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.760]   I mean, human beings are a little by batteries.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.760]   Okay.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.560]   That's, it's actually scientifically fact.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:20.600]   And so we, we run off of electricity, everything, all our chemical processes are run off positive
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:25.500]   negative charges and, and, and electricity going through, I mean, micro millivolts, right?
[00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.160]   Really tiny, but it, that's what we are.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.640]   And then we actually have a bio-magnetic, uh, field around us because we're electric
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.080]   and that bio-field is called the human bio-field.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.320]   I don't want to digress.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.840]   But you can, when you're feeling down, that means you're a low voltage, charge up like
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.840]   a battery.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.840]   And this is how you do it.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.560]   Uh, so I, I, I do this quite often and you just, the only thing you got to be careful
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.960]   of is, uh, don't do it too much or you won't sleep, you know, you're just going to charge
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.960]   up too much.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.960]   And that's as possible.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:55.080]   But yeah, whenever I'm feeling down a couple of coffee and hook up to the bio-modulator,
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:59.760]   um, and, and put 10s pads on, on these, the black goes on, black red goes on, you know,
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.760]   typical battery, right?
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.760]   Positive and negative.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.760]   Very important.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.800]   Because the body has positive negative, uh, portals, right?
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.480]   And then, and so you can see the manual really kind of goes into that.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.320]   So it's really, really, really helpful.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.240]   If you want to understand the bio, uh, modulator, this is it.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:18.320]   And then the other thing that the bio-modulator has that no other scene or has, and I'm not
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.360]   trying to sell these things, uh, I have no affiliation.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.520]   I'm not, I don't, yeah, I have no affiliation whatsoever.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.480]   Pick whatever product you want has nothing to do with, uh, my pocketbook.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.840]   Um, but the thing that makes this, and this is why it's my go to.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.600]   So like if I had to go to a deserted island, what would I take with me?
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.560]   I take, I have this little, you know, uh, laptop bag with all my bot bio-modulator stuff
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.440]   in it, plus all the accessories.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.440]   I'd grab that.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.680]   I'd grab that and I'd grab my dogs.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.520]   And, and that would be it, you know, and, and that would treat us for whatever happens.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.760]   Uh, but the thing about it, like I want to point out though, is it has a bio-transducer.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.240]   And that's what this thing is right here.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.720]   This is the, uh, the original one was called the crystal wave and then they upgraded to
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.720]   a bio-transducer.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.320]   And it's actually a newer model right now that's out.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.000]   Um, that's a, that looks a little, that does the same thing.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   It just looks different.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.520]   Uh, so that's what this guy is.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:12.320]   And, and what this little doohickey thing is, this thing above this girl's head, uh, like
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.320]   that right there.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   Um, let me see.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.960]   You've got a better picture of it, uh, I guess not.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.960]   Okay.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:22.240]   So let me just kind of expand on it so you can kind of see what the picture looks like.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.920]   Uh, so I've got this model right here.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:29.040]   And then I've got this, this little like, it looks like a, it looks like a telescope,
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   right?
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.640]   Uh, and so this thing right here has its own power supply.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.640]   It's battery operated.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.040]   You plug it into this guy.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:40.240]   And so then the, basically the bio-modulator sends a frequency pulse through the bio-transducer
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:45.800]   and what the transducer does is it translate, it basically translates, uh, lates or trans,
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.040]   unless it gets transmuted or whatever, uh, what is a better word for that?
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.920]   It basically just changes it into a scalar wave.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.920]   Okay.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.760]   And so the thing is, and this is a really important point.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:02.600]   I do want to point out is that it is hard to try to treat an internal organ, uh, with
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:08.280]   a, with a device that you place on the skin because you're sending a pulse through your,
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.280]   your body, right?
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.760]   And your body is made up of muscle, fat and tissue.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:17.320]   And then so the whole idea though, it's if anyone who understands radio waves is that
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.600]   your body absorbs energy that's been pumped into it.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:25.920]   And so every, like, you know, every centimeter that you go into your flesh, uh, you're decreasing
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.320]   the, uh, level of energy that's going to reach the next centimeter.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.520]   And it just keeps going down like a reverse hockey stick, right?
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:38.920]   And so, um, the, and so what tenant realized was that, you know, to get the optimum treatment
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:43.320]   of a scene are you needed to go deep into the body and how would you do that?
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:49.760]   And an irregular electrical bio electrical pulse will not have the same level of strength
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.640]   that the machine puts out four or five inches into your body.
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:58.800]   You know, and for those of us who are like me that we're kind of round, uh, the center
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.200]   of our mass could literally be four inches in, right?
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.480]   And so to get four inches in and still have the same, uh, level of energy, uh, with an
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.960]   electrical device, that's not going to happen because you're going to lose energy as you
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.360]   go inch by inch by inch into your flesh and then especially if it's bone.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.880]   So he invented the bio transducer, which is a scalar device.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.800]   And so whenever you're treating your internal organs, uh, or your brain, you know, anything
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:32.320]   that's past your, your bones, right, uh, or an inch into your body, uh, you use the bio
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.520]   transducer and, uh, and believe me, that thing works.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.800]   I've used it on my own self and it works a way better than a regular scene are because
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:45.440]   again, seniors can't penetrate that deep bio transducers can, can't.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:49.320]   And so the bio transducer can go right through your whole body and it sends a scalar wave,
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:53.840]   a scalar signal, uh, into whatever you're trying to treat and, uh, that's how you can
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:59.960]   get that pulse PMF, you know, frequency specific PMF pulse deep into your body, uh, with a
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.720]   scalar wave using a bio transducer.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.120]   I hope that wasn't too technical, but that's how it works.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.800]   And so that's kind of the cool part about it.
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.760]   So that's the quintessential.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.760]   And I hope that was concise.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.560]   Uh, how does it work?
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.160]   How do you know, what can you treat and then how to use it?
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:21.480]   And so the, how to use it buried in the manual, all those informations there, a video description,
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.320]   click the link if you want to learn more.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:28.440]   So next thing I know that everyone's asking besides like, okay, well, you know, uh, how
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.440]   does it work?
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.440]   What does it treat?
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.440]   How do you use it?
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.440]   It's okay.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.880]   Well, you know, what's the clinical and, uh, experience, uh, that's been reported and
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.560]   what are some of the studies?
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:41.720]   And so, you know, this is where I just want to say that, you know, you, I could spend
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:46.760]   days finding all of this stuff and, and document it, but I, you know, I just don't have that
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:52.360]   level of time, but what I did do though was I spent a good, like a half a day, uh, just
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:57.760]   going through, um, just the first like page, a page or two, I'd say the first page and half,
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.640]   two pages off of Google, Google Scholar, which is, you know, the website that searches
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.160]   through, uh, papers, uh, you know, it's clear on science papers, uh, and, and just looking
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:12.280]   at other websites, the actual manufacturer websites on what they report in terms of what
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:17.000]   are the, some of the studies and the clinical experience of the practitioners that are using
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.160]   these devices out in the field and like, again, it's been 34 years, right?
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.440]   And it said, there's a ton.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:27.640]   So I just grabbed a little snippet, um, and this is just like, you know, the papers that
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:32.120]   I grabbed right off, you know, that just, that's just a four hours of researching, uh, and
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.760]   just so that I could just share with you, uh, an example, okay?
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:42.680]   So this is just an example of what it can do, uh, based on not the, you know, user manual,
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.880]   which is in the guy that wrote it's trying to sell you one, right?
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:50.640]   Uh, but this is what the, uh, sciences that are studying this stuff and the clinical users
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.840]   that are using this stuff and what are they saying?
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.000]   So let's just look at just a few, okay, from, uh, just, you know, purely, uh, you know,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   just random, go through Google Scholar, let's take a look at a bunch of papers and just
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.480]   get it at, this little temple, you know, tip of the iceberg sampling of what the science
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.960]   literature says about the use of Scenars.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:12.560]   So the very first one is basically using Scenars right here, uh, skin therapy on skin
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.760]   burns, okay?
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.240]   And so what I'm just going to point out the, uh, the results, just jump to the results
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.400]   and so that this doesn't take too long.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:25.760]   But bottom line is that, um, the Scenars were discovered, you know, during the research,
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.440]   uh, the Scenar was used for applying three different methods described in the article.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.460]   Uh, and by the way, all of these are translated from Russian to English.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.460]   Okay.
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:39.760]   These are Russian studies, uh, state university of Rostov, on dong, okay, uh, tag on wrong.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.760]   Okay.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.760]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.760]   Okay.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:47.240]   So anyway, so, uh, they basically had some people had burns and they tried and they treated
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.240]   them with Scenars.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.240]   All right.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:53.360]   Uh, and so here's what the, uh, folks said about the Scenars, the results, let's go jump
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.920]   to that, uh, the results right here and I'll just point it out, uh, during the use of all
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:02.440]   the Scenar therapy, improvement in clinical blood value was stated in an anti-oxidative
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:08.800]   potential, reliable increase in superoxide, doom, distomutease and catalyst, uh, Earthrow
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.280]   sets, that's blood, red blood cells and the decrease of medium mass molecular concentration
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.280]   restored.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.880]   Uh, so this is all good stuff.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:20.640]   It basically helped and, uh, trying to find in, uh, you know, like a layman's, uh, sentence
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:26.160]   here that says, um, uh, there, I guess there's no, uh, there's no real night, I'm looking,
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.000]   and I don't see a layman statement that says, hey, this is, this worked.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   It helped.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   It improved, but that's what this means.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.720]   Uh, from a science or a medical standpoint, uh, it, it helped the burn and it healed it
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   faster.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.360]   Uh, here's another one on burns.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.360]   It just, this is what just popped up on Google.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:47.080]   Uh, I believe that words, I can find a little bit better, uh, I think right here.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:51.000]   So let's just say, usually you find it at the last two sentences of their, of the abstract,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.160]   but I don't think the Russians write their abstracts like, like we do.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.160]   Uh, okay.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:01.760]   So right in here, it says researchers or recent years, blah, blah, right, different.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:06.160]   Okay, so I did find this earlier, research findings, here we go.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:13.480]   When combined with anesthesia analgesia, okay, so that'd be like burn gel or something.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:19.440]   The effect could be noted in five patients in 10 minutes, 10 patients blah, blah, blah,
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.440]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:27.280]   The results, evidence that painful sensation was reduced in 94% of the primary group.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:35.380]   In the control group, they were using the analgesics, only 56% and then 44% asked for
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.120]   additional analgesic injections due to pain.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:44.960]   So that's pretty awesome, 94% of the primary group received a benefit from using the cenar
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.280]   on the burns.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.280]   Here's another one.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:55.480]   This one's another translation, effectiveness of cenar in complex treatment of ulcer.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:59.280]   And I couldn't, this is one of those ones, I couldn't find the whole study.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.540]   I only could get the abstract, but here we go.
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:08.160]   This is in combination with the normal treatment, they use the cenar, okay, with it.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:13.760]   And so in addition of cenar therapy, the complex conventional pharmacology, fastened, ulcer healing
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.680]   increased the effectiveness of this.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.680]   Wow.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.680]   Here's a word.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:25.040]   Heliobacter, plural, or I'm sorry, I don't want to be doing this, eradication and improve
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:29.240]   the condition of the gastrointestinal, do neural mucosa.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:34.280]   All right, I'm so sorry guys, but okay, it improved, okay, let's just stick with the
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:40.080]   word improved and it helped, it helped treat their, it made their ulcer treatment better
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.880]   by using a cenar.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:48.000]   Here's another Russian translated one, cenar therapy for chronic insomnia.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.720]   And bottom line is, you know, they talk about doctors and they did 342 doctors and they had
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:58.840]   them fill out a questionnaire before and after cenar treatment that says, hey, did this thing
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.840]   help you sleep better, okay, with insomnia.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:07.180]   And so let's just, and this is the zap, oh man, this is some kind of medicine, the zap
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:13.500]   on, so what they did was they gave the doctor's medicine to help them with their insomnia,
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:17.700]   okay, and then they gave them a cenar to help them with their insomnia and they wanted
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:21.140]   to compare the cenar to the medicine, all right, and this is what happened.
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:28.220]   So now they did a survey, it's a self assessment, 342 doctors did a self assessment on before
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:32.900]   and after using the drug, and then they did another one before and after using a cenar
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:36.700]   for the same problem, quality of sleep, okay, right there.
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:41.140]   And so just like real quick here, here's their characteristics of sleep and how long I took
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.580]   them to fall, how long they slept, blah, blah, blah, but the total evaluation I think is
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:46.500]   what's really kind of impressive here.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:52.860]   On the drug, right, the average score was 16.3, this is how, you know, this is basically
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:56.300]   their crappy life, but you know, when they took the drug, you know, the average score
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:38:01.260]   went up to 22.7 on their scale, whatever the scale was, right, and if you did some math,
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:05.420]   you know, that's a pretty good percentage increase in improvement by using the drug.
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.940]   But what's really cool is check this out.
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:12.420]   When they did the self assessment, it pretty much came out the same before the cenar treatment,
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.060]   but after the cenar treatment, look at this.
[00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:22.500]   Using a bio electrical device, no drugs, they roughly achieved the same result as taking
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.500]   a drug.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:26.980]   There was an improvement in their sleep, no drugs.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:34.860]   I mean, repeat that, it's so important because I'm anti drug, okay, it's an improvement equivalent
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:39.900]   to that of taking a pharmaceutical, okay, let that sink in, all right.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.140]   So now here's another one.
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.620]   This one gets really complicated, and when I read this thing, I had a hard time.
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:49.900]   There are no English words in here that any, I even understood, but you know, it's going
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:53.540]   to be one of those other ones where it's like, hey, it improved, okay.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:59.260]   And what it improved, I still haven't figured it out, but it's in the, okay, well, I did
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:01.140]   try to read this again.
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:06.900]   And what I got out of it was this study basically says it had, it that the cenar improved the
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:13.140]   the anti oxidative responses within the blood in very complex words that I had to go look
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.620]   up in a dictionary.
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:18.060]   So I'll leave you with that one for you science guys, you can know our medical guys.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:23.420]   Now here's another one that's English translation of a Russian universal mexida.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:27.340]   And this is a mechanisms of cenar effect again here in oxidative stress.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:30.540]   This study actually says, yeah, it basically right here.
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:35.460]   The anti radical effect, the cenar therapy is universal for various pathological processes.
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:38.740]   So it's anti oxidative, anti radical.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.740]   So then you know what that means.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.540]   Alright, if you guys take it C 60.
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.700]   So here we go.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:48.720]   Another one here, which is the Russian study done in it was, I'm sorry, is a cenar clinical
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.580]   trial in the United States using a Russian medical device, right?
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.580]   That's what it is.
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:57.980]   And so in this guy, again, they took a bunch of people, they had them rate themselves.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:00.260]   It was, I believe was on for pain.
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:03.940]   And then here's your, here's your, here's your reported pain scores, right?
[00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:07.260]   You know, you go to the chiropractor or your doctor, go on a scale of one to 10, how much
[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.260]   pain you in, right?
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:11.580]   And then that's what they did with these folks and these folks came in.
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:13.860]   Their rate of pain was, you know, high.
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.540]   And then they use the cenar and it got better.
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:17.540]   It dropped.
[00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.060]   That's, that's the point there.
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.540]   And then there's one, another one, cenar for pain relief and chronic illness.
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.020]   I found this on research gate.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:31.740]   It's an actual really good article about just different practitioners reporting in their
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:35.420]   clinical experiences using cenars in their practices.
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.820]   And then this is my favorite.
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:40.820]   I found this on the e-body fusion website Benedict Howard.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.420]   Great guy lives in Maui, another Hawaiian guy.
[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.000]   He teaches how to use a cenar.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.740]   He's a Denas distributor.
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.980]   And on his website, there's this study.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.700]   And this is the most profound study I will share with you about cenars.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.340]   And I think it's so valuable.
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:01.060]   Basically, the cenar trials was done in the 1980s in Russia.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.060]   Okay.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:10.860]   In 1980s in Russia, the Russians, they tested 18,000 people right here, okay, 18,000 people
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.180]   with diseases all over the place.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.260]   I mean, look at all the different things.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:19.820]   They had digestion problems, circulation, ear problems, musculoskeleton, respiratory
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.260]   and, and oral genital problems.
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.260]   Okay.
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:28.900]   So 18,000 people, and they use cenars on them to see what would happen.
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:33.020]   I mean, how could they make, you know, could they, could they cure them, treat them, right?
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.380]   With a cenar.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.860]   And the cure rate was 88.5 percent.
[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:46.700]   Okay, 88.5 percent of the 18,000 people reported they got better using cenars.
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:47.700]   This is the Russians.
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.300]   That's why it's a big deal in Russia.
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.580]   So I mean, and, and you, this is in the directory.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.580]   You guys can read this thing.
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.780]   It's also on Benedict site, e-body fusion.
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:56.780]   Okay.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.780]   But here you go.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.940]   And they actually go through one by one.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.020]   They go, here's, here's the results on the circulation.
[00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.060]   People who had problems with digestion.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:09.420]   People who had problems with their ears, their musculoskeletal system, respiratory system,
[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:14.380]   you know, whether it's like sinuses, bronchitis, tonsillitis, you know, on and on and on and
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:15.380]   on.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.300]   And you can actually see the individual results here.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.620]   And you can see the cure rate, the percentage people got cured and the ones that reported
[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:24.940]   it, like this one right here, 93 percent of the people reported they got improvement
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:28.140]   from using a cenar, right?
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:35.660]   So this is huge when you look and this is clinical experience slash scientific studies
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:42.900]   proving that cenars do all this incredible stuff for the human body when used correctly.
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:48.540]   So I can't stress enough that this isn't just some woo woo magic stuff coming from Russia,
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:55.620]   but this is actual real medical treatment devices that do real stuff that can really
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:56.780]   help you.
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:43:01.180]   So if, again, going back to you, finally had one device, this, this would mean I go to,
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.180]   I use it for everything.
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:06.660]   I mean, any little aches and pains, any problems, whatever I do, have an issue, man, I grab
[00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:10.580]   this thing and, and it, I literally, I'm good to go by using it.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:14.460]   So that's why I'm doing this presentation so that I can share this information with the
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:15.460]   rest of you.
[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:21.100]   Well, let's think, let's talk about what do you consider before buying a cenar.
[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:25.500]   And so one of the things I think that's really important for those of you guys, if I've gotten
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:29.820]   you interested in getting a cenar because you've never heard about one before, or that
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.380]   if you already have one, you might want to upgrade or whatever.
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:36.300]   But here's the idea of what to consider for those of you who are new to this concept and
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.780]   new to this type of technology that can help you.
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:42.540]   I mean, I, you know, honestly, everyone should have one of these in their home because it's
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:48.480]   a lot easier, faster, cheaper and less dangerous than going to a doctor, okay, to treat yourself.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.420]   And so one of the things that I want to say is try before you buy.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:56.220]   If you're brand new to cenars, then go find someone who's using one in their practice.
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:01.540]   There's thousands of people using cenars in their practices, even in the United States.
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:05.980]   A lot of chiropractors do a lot of like health and wellness centers do.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:10.300]   And basically I would just sit there and use a search engine, find someone in your local
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:14.060]   area who's using these things, they're going to, they're going to say on their website
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:18.820]   that they do or call around and you will find a chiropractor or some other kind of wellness
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:22.620]   person, acupuncturists, healers, you know, those kinds of guys.
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:25.940]   And they're going to be in the ones that use these things, you can go ahead and get a treatment
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:31.720]   and see if it helps you and most likely it will, you know, unless you're like really,
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.620]   really, really, really, really, really missed up.
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:35.620]   Okay.
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:39.220]   So hold, but the idea though is try before you buy.
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:43.420]   Now, if you want to buy, then you have to know that one of the things that there's a huge
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:47.780]   difference between devices, okay, not only in the different companies and the different
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:53.060]   models that are made, but that every single place that makes these things makes two different
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.780]   levels of devices.
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.380]   One for practitioners and one for people at home.
[00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:02.660]   So the ones for practitioners are way more complicated, okay, and they have a lot more
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.340]   features and so that you compete, you know, so those guys could like, you know, diagnose
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:11.140]   and then dial into it instead of like a broad spectrum kind of like approach, right?
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:15.860]   Like a home device would be for us, us laymen's that, you know, we're kind of like, you know,
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:19.660]   I'm speaking personally, you know, like, you know, Neanderthals, right, trying to use a
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:20.660]   stick.
[00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.440]   And so, you know, and so they make them simple.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:28.900]   There's less, less variability, simple features so that, you know, people can use them from
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:33.380]   home and we don't have to take like, you know, a week or two or three or four training
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:34.820]   to understand how to use it.
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:39.260]   So that's the main difference and then, and because of the fact that the practitioners
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:46.740]   models are deeply feature rich and the home ones are vastly simplified, there's a huge
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:51.020]   price difference because you could imagine that there's a lot more money to build or
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:55.460]   device that's for a practitioner than you would for someone who's at home.
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:59.580]   So the price range is now for some of these, now you see the scene are like this guy right
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:05.340]   here, this is the practitioner version of this guy right here, which is my home version.
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:06.340]   Okay.
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:11.180]   And this guy right here, this is the practitioner version of my home version, which is this guy
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.180]   right there.
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.180]   Okay.
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.420]   So it's going to be a lot more expensive.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:21.080]   So if you buy one of these practitioners, it could cost you 3,000 on up to 12,000, depending
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.420]   on what model you buy, practitioner.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:28.980]   Now, for the home model, as I said, the home model, you could buy this guy right here,
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:33.540]   the PCM six for like, you know, 300 bucks full package, 400 under 400 bucks.
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.060]   This guy right here sells for about 350.
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:41.980]   This guy right here sells for about 3000, but if you if you keep an eye on eBay, you can
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:47.660]   usually buy a retired one because people upgrade all the time.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.020]   And that's how I got the two I own.
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.460]   I actually own two of these, an older model and a newer model.
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:57.820]   And so I got them like half price off eBay because the person who was using it upgraded
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:46:58.820]   to the next one.
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:02.940]   So then they sold their old one for me upgraded to the next one, but I gave my old one to my
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.620]   daughter kind of thing.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:09.100]   But so that's basically the concept there is that you could see where the price ranges
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:13.020]   on the more it can do, right, the higher the price.
[00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:17.900]   So you could get as something as simple as like under 400 or you could go wild and you
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:22.460]   could go full of full on package like you get the bio module, bio modulator package for
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.580]   home is just 10 grand.
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:30.660]   But you could get it on eBay like I did for 27, 100 for the whole package, that included
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:31.660]   the bio modulator.
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:32.660]   I'm sorry, the bio transducer.
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:36.580]   So anyway, so that's that's the key thing to remember is that that's why there's a huge
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:40.100]   price range home versus practitioner models.
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:43.260]   And then there's also this thing, you know, and I'm going to be honest with you, it is
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:44.940]   a steep learning curve.
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.180]   You know, you could get something like that PCM six where you just follow along with what
[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.500]   the screen says.
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:51.100]   And then I don't recommend this guy.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:55.740]   This guy is the oldest model that I own actually have an older older one that's like 15 years
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:56.740]   old.
[00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:57.900]   That's an old Donas model.
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:00.060]   I think that's this guy right here.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:03.660]   This is what it looks like super old model when these guys came out is like my kid was
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:05.180]   a toddler.
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.500]   And so, but I do have that model.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:12.900]   And so I don't recommend that guy, these older guys, I don't recommend these because
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:16.420]   you don't look how you have to look up the user interface on this guy whoops, the user
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:20.420]   interface on this guy is just all buttons and you have to know what the buttons are.
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:24.140]   And I always forget what the buttons mean and I have to go look at the manual every
[00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:25.180]   time I want to set it.
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.540]   So I don't really use it that often.
[00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:31.500]   But I'll tell you what, I tore a rotator cuff a few years ago and this thing saved me.
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:32.740]   It saved me.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:36.620]   I mean, I use this thing twice a day, 15 minutes on a torn rotator cuff.
[00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:39.900]   I could not even lift my arm, right?
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:44.740]   And the, and basically the, you know, pet or not pet vet, I was going to say pet vet,
[00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:48.220]   the medical, the medical med was it web MD.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:52.100]   That guy said was like, hey, average person with a torn rotator is going to be three
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.100]   weeks, right?
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:57.500]   Man, I use my CNR 15 minutes a day twice a day on the rotator cuff.
[00:48:57.500 --> 00:49:01.980]   In one week, I could lift my arm and use it without pain.
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.900]   And that's just how amazing these things are.
[00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:08.940]   But so this thing works, it's just real complicated because of the buttons as opposed to look
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:09.940]   at the screen.
[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:12.260]   And then this guy here, it takes training.
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.260]   But you know, it's worth it.
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:14.260]   I'm going to tell you that.
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:15.260]   But there's a steep learning curve.
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.900]   So I just want to be honest with you guys.
[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:20.140]   If you're going to do this, be prepared to learn how to do it.
[00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:23.620]   You can't take the typical guy approach where you just jump in and start playing around
[00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:24.620]   with it.
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:25.620]   That won't work.
[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:30.140]   You need to take the training, read the manual and that's required with these things.
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:33.180]   But I'm going to say it's completely worth it.
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.180]   Okay.
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.180]   Take the time.
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.180]   If you're interested in this.
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:40.300]   Now the other thing too, again, is the customized features I mentioned, which was again, you
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:44.060]   know, like the biomodulator has the healing voltage aspect to it.
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.460]   And then lastly, the accessories.
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:48.100]   So these are the things you need to think about.
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:52.220]   And where the accessories come into play is what do you want to do?
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:56.440]   What is your issue that you want to, you know, do you want something that's, you know, just
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.540]   something in the home that can handle like your like a first aid kit kind of thing that
[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:03.060]   can handle anything that comes along or you're someone like me, that I have very specific
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:07.060]   issues, which is why I got these things, which was like, I got back issues.
[00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:11.620]   I got a blown knee, you know, I mean, you know, and, and you know, also, I'm also aging.
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:12.620]   You know, I love aging.
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:16.020]   Everything's wonderful, isn't it for you guys that are out there that you're into the latter
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.460]   half of your years, right?
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:18.460]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:20.380]   You wake up every day and go, okay, now what's going to hurt?
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:21.780]   I have no idea how I got hurt.
[00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:24.980]   I'm just hurt, you know, so I, you know, something hurts.
[00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:28.060]   Let's go put my senior on it and boom, it goes away.
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:30.260]   So now accessories is really important.
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.700]   And I mean, there are tons of accessories.
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:37.940]   The user manuals will display what the different accessories are, you know, for each one of
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.100]   their devices, okay?
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:44.220]   And so I'm just going to walk you through real quickly, like, okay, so if you wanted
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:48.700]   to like, let's say, treat a knee, treat a hand, you know, arthritis and that sort of
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:51.940]   thing, they've got sleeves and gloves you could put on.
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:55.820]   If you want to treat your eyes for macular degeneration, glaucoma, that sort of thing,
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.100]   you can get something for your eyeballs.
[00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:02.100]   This one here is the, they call it the facial probe, but I swear, if you get one, get one
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:07.020]   of these for just right off the bat, because if you're holding your CNR on one hand and
[00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:11.060]   you're looking at the, you know, the display and you need to reach around and treat your
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:15.060]   back, let me tell you, it's a lot easier to do that with this probe.
[00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:18.140]   So you want to get this probe and they call it the facial probe, which is what you use
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:23.660]   it for, but it also is an excellent, like I call it like an extension cord for the CNR.
[00:51:23.660 --> 00:51:26.260]   So that's really, really the most important one I have.
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.460]   I have one for everyone in my devices.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:31.540]   Now this guy right here is for treating the scalp.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:34.460]   And so it's got these little prongs so you can get through the hair, right, and reach the
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:36.380]   actual skin on the head.
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:41.540]   These Y probes and this little dental probe right there, these are like pinpoint probes.
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:46.140]   I can't go into it because I'm already at like, you know, 51 minutes, but this guy right
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:53.380]   here not only can treat your teeth, but you can use it for using, for using a CNR as an
[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:58.740]   electro acupuncture device, because you can get it down to the pinpoint, you know, the
[00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:04.660]   electro probe that'll send the pulse frequency through this little tiny pinpoint probe, which
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:09.180]   means you could place it on an acupuncture point and use it for electro acupuncture.
[00:52:09.180 --> 00:52:10.180]   Okay.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:11.860]   So that's how you can use a CNR for that.
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:14.140]   Can't get into that right now, but that's what that's for.
[00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:18.020]   But it's actually, they designed this for dental, but you can use it for this other purpose.
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:23.180]   Now the Y probe is for basically treating, you know, adrenals issues and then so forth
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:26.500]   and you got your, you know, if you want to charge your whole body charging is got plates
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:31.420]   and handhelds, tens pads, yes, you can use pads with your CNR.
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:35.460]   And believe me, I just set this thing on auto and I, and I just put one on each side of
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:36.460]   the black and the red, right?
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:41.460]   And I just let that puppy run and I'll tell you what, instant backache gone.
[00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:43.700]   Here's the pads for shoulders, knees and backs.
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.660]   This comes, this is the PCM six version.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.740]   And then you got this thing right here, this monstrosity thing.
[00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.900]   Look how many different probes are all tied into this thing.
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:57.020]   And this goes with the PCM model, the denace models, the successory.
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:58.740]   It's 15,000 man.
[00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.820]   And you know, I'd love to play with one, but there's no way.
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:03.220]   I got that kind of money, but you just lay on this thing.
[00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:09.900]   So it's like full on full body charging and treatment of the entire back for some, and
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.420]   it's got all of these electrodes on it.
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:16.460]   You just lay on this thing and you do a full body charging.
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:18.540]   And then of course I talked about the bio transducer.
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:22.940]   So, and you know what, this little snippet here, this little slide is it doesn't even
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:26.180]   touch the tip of the iceberg on all the different accessories.
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:30.500]   So, but here's my, the point though, right, is what are you trying to treat?
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.060]   And then there's an accessory for that.
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.060]   So there you go.
[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:34.300]   And you know, this has been around forever.
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:38.740]   So there's an accessory for almost everything, including things to put up your behind.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:39.740]   Okay.
[00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.260]   So anyway, moving along, digress.
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:46.700]   So now if you want to learn more about Cenars, the first thing again is, you know, you definitely
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:49.140]   want to go find a practitioner near you.
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:50.140]   Okay.
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:54.220]   Like I mentioned and try before you buy, if you want to learn more, you definitely, like
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:57.980]   I said, video description, there's going to be three folders and you're going to see
[00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:01.340]   a folder with all the science studies and clinical experience documentation.
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:03.740]   I'll have a folder of the user manuals.
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:04.740]   Okay.
[00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:09.980]   And then there's another folder, something else is in there, I just went blank.
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:10.980]   Okay.
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:16.020]   But all the documentation of everything you're seeing today is in the folder in the video
[00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:17.020]   description.
[00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:20.500]   So that's how you would then learn more, find a practitioner.
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:24.180]   And if you want to buy your own, my recommendation there is I'm not going to feature all the
[00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:29.740]   hundreds of websites that sell these things, but I will say again, that, you know, these
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.300]   things are not cheap.
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:32.860]   The cheaper ones, yeah, you can just pick up.
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:37.700]   I mean, it's no brainer, not more than a cost of a TV, but if you're really serious
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:42.500]   about it, then do what I do, which is I camp, I go sit on eBay and I camp out on that thing
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:45.180]   till I find a, I find a used one.
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:46.780]   And they're just as good.
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:51.900]   And if you get a used like biomodulator, it still allows you, if you register the serial
[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:56.260]   number to attend the university, so it's, and I got that through in a state cell.
[00:54:56.260 --> 00:55:01.500]   So you know, yeah, that's how I get most of my devices that I just get a really huge discount,
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:07.900]   just camping on eBay and waiting for a really, really good opportunity, really good offer.
[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:12.300]   And then otherwise you're buying retail and I don't know about the sales, but you know,
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:15.660]   the whole idea though is that's what I do in terms of, you know, buying your own.
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.700]   If you wanted to do that, once you're convinced you want it, and then of course learning how
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:19.700]   to use it.
[00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:20.700]   Oh, that's right.
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:24.220]   The third thing I wanted to share with you is the learning how you use it thing.
[00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:31.260]   Again, if you want to learn how to use it, then you could go, you know, and read through
[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:34.700]   the manuals, but I did want to tell you that I've got this little training folder right
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:37.180]   here that I'm going to share with you.
[00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:41.900]   And basically it's over the years I've been collecting all these different videos as I
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:46.420]   find them on YouTube and wherever about how to use one.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:50.580]   And so these are like, it's like all these different tutorials on how to use the denazs,
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:54.460]   how to use the Chan's senior, different people giving courses.
[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:56.580]   And so like there's a ton of little videos in here.
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:01.380]   Let me just kind of show you the thumbnails of all the different videos on how to use
[00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:04.500]   different seniors to help you get better.
[00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:08.700]   So if you wanted to just kind of just get a peek, you know, into the different types
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:13.220]   of training materials and actually watch videos of people using them, you know, go to that
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:17.260]   video, go to this video section here called training, and you can go and watch those
[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.260]   videos there.
[00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:19.260]   Okay?
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:23.420]   Last thing I want to say, and thank you for sticking out in this long video, is that
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:25.940]   it works on critters, okay?
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:28.980]   And that's the most, for me it's one of the most important things because, you know,
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:30.980]   my family includes my dogs.
[00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:35.700]   And so it's a little different, okay, now, and this is something I want to do point out,
[00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:39.220]   like this little guy right here for the human hair, it doesn't work on animals, okay?
[00:56:39.220 --> 00:56:46.980]   And so what works on animals, okay, is they make special cuffs, which I don't have a picture
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:53.940]   of that you can connect to it, and basically you use a electro gel and you put the cuff
[00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:58.780]   on them, or you could use this guy with a electro gel so that you basically have this
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:04.660]   electro gel which makes their fur wet on whatever area you're treating.
[00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:10.300]   You put the probe on the gel and then that way the electrical pulse can pass through
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.640]   to the skin.
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:15.020]   Otherwise you have to shave them, and you know, some of you might not want to shave
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:18.380]   your dog just so you could treat them, but you cannot just put the probe up against
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:21.860]   fur, it will not work, it just doesn't go through fur.
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:26.660]   And they really, and you know, so far I haven't seen any of these guys actually produce an
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:31.460]   accessory that works for that, but I did find an accessory with the frequency specific
[00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:37.380]   guys, the FSM guys, and they actually created a cuff to go with their devices that does
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:41.820]   work as well as, you know, and I use, I just use an electro gel.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:48.180]   So when I want to treat my dog in the old days, when I just had a PCM6 or a chance, I would
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:54.220]   treat them with one of these using electro gel, but now that I've got one of these guys,
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:59.060]   which I just got last Christmas, I have a transducer, you don't even need, you just hold
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:03.180]   that thing over and it just shoots the, the frequency right into their, through their
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.180]   fur.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:08.220]   Okay, so, but this is not cheap, okay, so the cheaper way to do it is by a regular one
[00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.220]   in this one.
[00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:13.900]   Otherwise you can use a transducer, but you can treat your animals with a cinar with
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:19.380]   their appropriate accessory, and they will get all of the benefits, all of the benefits
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:22.900]   that you would get, they would get it as well because they're mammals just like us, and
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:26.980]   we love them and we want to treat them so you can treat your horses and your livestock,
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:30.820]   you can treat your pets, and just, you know, it's, it's just beneficial to them, it is
[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:31.820]   for us.
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:35.620]   So, and you know what, think about all the vet bills you'd say, okay, so that's it.
[00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:38.100]   I just want to say thank you and there's a lot to cover.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:42.100]   I really appreciate your, you know, your, your time that you're spending with me, and,
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:45.900]   and your interest in senors, and you know, I can't be more excited enough to share this
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:52.500]   with you because I'm very passionate about be your own healer, help yourself, help your
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:56.460]   loved ones, stay away from people who push drugs on you and see what you can do to help
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:57.460]   yourself.
[00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:01.660]   And I'll tell you this scene, our technology is literally the number one way to go about
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:02.660]   doing that.
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:07.380]   So thank you again, really appreciate you spending some time and stopping by to watch
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:08.380]   this video.
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:10.140]   And I really appreciate your kind comments.
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:15.100]   If you want to learn more about what I do on, on the series, I have a blog called The
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:16.100]   Tinkers Academy.
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:20.140]   I have a whole section on there about bio electrical healing, and then of course I've got a bio
[00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:24.620]   electrical healing group on telegram where we chat about all this kind of stuff all
[00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:25.780]   the time.
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:28.940]   And so there's going to be links below if you want to check out the blog or join the chat
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:30.980]   group and learn more, ask questions.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:34.980]   Again, if you, you know, I'm always on it, I'm the moderator for the chat group.
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:37.340]   So if you got any questions, that's where you'll find me.
[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:38.340]   Okay.
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:39.340]   Thanks again, guys.
[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:40.340]   I really appreciate it.
[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:44.460]   And, and just, you know what, good health to you and your loved ones and take care of
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:45.460]   yourselves.
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:46.460]   All right.
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:46.660]   Aloha.
