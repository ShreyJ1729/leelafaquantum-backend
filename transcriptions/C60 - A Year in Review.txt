[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another carbon 60 video by me K Elmer and this video
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.280]   I just like to take a look at C 60 a year in review market trends
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.720]   Pricing and some of the new studies that have come out in the last 12 months
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.160]   So figured you might be interested in this if you're taking C 60 and let's jump right in
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.680]   So real quick disclaimers. I just want to stipulate. I have no affiliation with any C 60 company
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.240]   Don't own anything. Don't sell anything that sort of thing. And again, I just want to remind everybody whenever I'm talking about C 60
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.740]   That C 60s as a supplement is still very experimental
[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.480]   It's not been approved by the FDA or F EFSA and at the end of the day, you know
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.820]   Just remember if you're taking C 60 you are the human trial and until some of those get published
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.760]   We really don't know so keep that in mind. It's still experimental. All right, so let's jump right in
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.680]   You know over the last year and even over the last five years
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.840]   You know taking a look at the Google trends for people searching on C 60. It really has not changed
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.520]   It's sort of like if you did a logarithmic
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.680]   You know analysis of the trend line here in terms of people typing in C 60 in Google to try to find out
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.960]   You know obviously search on it, you know, it's gonna be flat
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.840]   So literally over the fast last five years since it kind of got popular back in at the end of 2017
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.520]   It became a little bit more popular. Well, actually a lot more popular than it was
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.600]   But since 2017 there really hasn't been other than that initial spike
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.580]   At the very beginning of at the end of 2017 early 2018
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.920]   There hasn't really been a whole lot more interest in it
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.120]   And you know in retrospect when you try to take a look at you know
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.880]   If you're if you're one of the individuals who sell C 60 or your adamant that it's such a great anti-aging bio hack
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.720]   You know supplement to take, you know, you take a look at and you go
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.840]   Well, why hasn't it been growing other than other than that first spur and really, you know
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.940]   if you just kind of search on YouTube and this is my opinion, but you know, there's just it's just not a lot of
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:02.520]   promotion, you know, you know, you've got, you know, Chris from SES you've got Ken from Purple Power and you've got
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.100]   I.N. from Wizard's Science and those are the three main guys that are out there producing C 60 and putting the word out about how
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.920]   Great C 60 is and you know, but they're just not reaching the audience that they need to get to so you know
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.920]   It is really kind of interesting in that regard
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.360]   But yeah, it's flatline. It really isn't much growing on you take a look at the top, you know
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.580]   Just for the U.S. You take a look at the top, you know, five states that are doing, you know, where the searchers are coming from and it is a real
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.540]   Interesting that the highest number of the top five
[00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:39.460]   States that are people in their states are actually Googling for C 60 number one is North Dakota, Kansas, Iowa
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.420]   So it is interesting, you know that there's this audience in the Midwest
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.600]   That's way more interested in C 60 than, you know, the liberal coast
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.320]   So, you know, it is kind of interesting, but that's the trend that's it's just not growing and until you know
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.760]   If you're out there and you're one of the producers, you know until you guys really need to reach a much bigger audience get with the health influencers
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.840]   Maybe even advertise. I know it's expensive, but yeah, it's just you know, and of course the competition is really really really high
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.200]   Literally every single month. There's this new, you know, you know, really cool new supplement to take and so someone like myself
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.880]   I'm a biohacker. I'm always looking for what's the next best greatest thing, you know, six six
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.520]   He's literally a five-year-old thing that I started but I really believe in it and I've taken it ever since
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:30.800]   But you know, it's kind of like the competition for attention as to supplements, you know, it's a multi-billion dollar industry
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.060]   There's a ton of noise. How do you get heard over that noise and so whatever you're doing right now?
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.960]   It's not really moving the dial. That's my point. Anyway, moving around along. So let's take a look at the prices
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.440]   I just did a quick scan, you know, for those of you who may remember a couple years back
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.200]   I was doing an annual price guide just you know
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   I started in the very beginning in 2017 the price guide was only a I think it was like nine
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:02.880]   Seven or nine different companies in the world were selling C60 oil for people who wanted to take it as a supplement
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.160]   And now I'm sure by now there's well over, you know, 50 more or more, you know
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.320]   Worldwide probably a hundred or something so that it would just it blew up in terms of the number of people producing C60 oil for health
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.320]   But anyway, I went back a year ago grab just, you know, the top of the list
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.120]   You know over here on the retail side and just said hey, you know in 2021
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.720]   What were their prices and then now in 2023? What's changed?
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.680]   So from a standpoint of has inflation hit the C60 market? I guess that's the question in red
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.320]   You'll see where the prices went up over here on the retail side for the most part though
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:46.320]   You take a look at the 11, you know the top 11 that I grabbed off the list the top 11 only four of them had to increase their prices
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.560]   So that's you know way less than half so, you know, so that's kind of an interesting thing
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.320]   You know like C60 retail wise inflation hasn't really hit it that hard
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:05:00.840]   Some places have increased their prices, but most places have not so so there you go on the retail side is kind of like, you know
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.680]   Stabilized what's interesting though when you look at the wholesale price of buying C60 powder to make C60 oil and by the way
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.800]   I'm just going by one gram. Okay, so, you know, obviously if you're making C60
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.760]   You're buying it literally by the pound or the kill kill
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.400]   You know the kilo and you're you know and you're buying it in bulk and you're gonna get a lot cheaper
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.720]   But this is the you know average joke wants to go buy a gram and make some, you know, C60 oil at home price, right?
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.400]   And so for one gram you look at the prices and I just grab again
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.040]   I just grab the top of the list
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.920]   There's nine of those producers out there and the red stipulates the prices went down
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.080]   So that was really and you know, honestly if you go to Bucky Labs right now and you might if you're interested
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.080]   You know if you buy from Bucky Labs and you go right now and you look at the 99.95
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.400]   It's it's the same as 99. I don't know if that's a website glitch or not
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.960]   But the price went from 230 to 185 now for 99.95 percent C60
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.080]   MTR has dropped their price kind of I think they're having like a sale based on on the price guide that they've got out there
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:10.000]   But it's definitely special pricing. They do mention that so right now. This is March 11, 2023
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.400]   You know the price for one gram of 99.95 is dropped down from 109 to 93
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   So, you know, so there you go there
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.920]   But you know again, you know, just like the retail side and the wholesale side not so much pronounced
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.080]   But I just want to point out and I always do whenever I do a price guide that
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.240]   You've got a company out there producing 100 milliliters of C60 oil in olive oil
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.920]   I know that they use Kirkland olive oil. I don't know where they source their C60 from
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.280]   But they're selling it for like 25 bucks for 100 milliliters
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.960]   And then you know, you kind of people do different bottles, right? So some people have 100 milliliter bottles
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.800]   Some people have four ounce bottles, but they're kind of the same
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.640]   Let's not you know, I want to get into semantics
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:59.000]   But but bottom line though, you know, you look at like let's say carbon 60 plus sells a four ounce bottle for
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.600]   $27 and then you've got to live longer labs out there and even C60 power selling it for a hundred two hundred and seventeen
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.000]   Dollars for the same product four ounces of C60 oil
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.840]   Now they all claim that they do special stuff to it and etc
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.960]   But I just want you know, there's a huge price swing
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.400]   From the retail side. So, you know, if you're if you're the person who doesn't want to go through the you know
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.600]   The effort of making your own. Nope. No problem there. You don't do what you want to do
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.960]   Just realize that there are some serious price
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.600]   Differences in the retail market
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.960]   And you really could save yourself a lot if you just shop around or
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.320]   You may be paying four times more than what you really need to
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.600]   Okay, so keep that in mind any other thing to you on the wholesale side
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.800]   You know, the spread is not that wide, you know with mtr doing this special thing right now
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.520]   They're pretty much the lowest per gram and then of course you've got, you know, uh, laila labs
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.480]   Is selling at wholesale?
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.600]   To the telegram group so they're selling at $1.2250 per gram
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.720]   And it really doesn't get any closer to that number
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:11.480]   Ali baba, you know, I just throw this on the list. It's 120. I personally never buy anything that's sourced from china
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.520]   So I do like laila labs. It's sourced from solaris and even slors
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.560]   If you were to buy at their price, it's 149
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.560]   So definitely get a really good deal if you come into the c60 telegram check group
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:28.040]   And buy from laila or you know, of course there's mtr as well again mtr. Um, I don't know where they source from
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:34.840]   Um, and you know, I just in my opinion my opinion if they source from ses or they source from solaris
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:41.400]   Right, which are the two biggest manufacturers. Um, you know, they would they would brag about it because those are like the highest quality
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:49.960]   Uh c60 producers, uh in north america, you know, I mean, I know that bucky sources from ses and pure c60 olive oil sources from ses
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.680]   So, you know, the everybody if you're buying from ses or you're buying from solaris
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.400]   You're gonna brag about it. You're gonna mention it on your website mtr and does not mention that on the website
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.000]   So I don't know where they get it from
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.120]   Uh, so there you go. Anyway, so that's the price guide inflation a little bit of inflation on the retail side
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:14.760]   Wild price swings on the retail side whole sale side not so much wild price swings, but the you know, but affordability is still there
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:21.400]   Right. I personally buy from laila labs. I I love supporting them because they support our community on telegram
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.880]   So i'm very loyal. Uh, and that's why i'm loyal. You know, they came in and they replaced our old
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.520]   Co-op that we used to have
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:35.080]   So yeah, uh and still at 120 250 a gram from laila labs. You're producing a liter of c60 oil
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.280]   Every single, you know, and a leader will last you three months. So try to imagine how cheap that is
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.920]   To make your own it's literally less than half
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.560]   Of what it would cost to buy it and that's buying it at a cheaper, you know buying it at this price here
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.280]   It's still half of that, you know, if you make your own anyway, I think I think I said enough about that
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.640]   All right, so let's get into the studies now. This is where it gets really cool
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.760]   And i'm really glad, you know, and I had to kind of do a deep dive
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:06.520]   I mean like literally go page by page by page by page on google scholar to find anything because there's the bulk of the c60 studies
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.160]   Is using c60 in industry? Okay, and that's where it came from
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.560]   Uh, that's you know, that's they've been using c60 in industry since it was discovered
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.400]   Uh back in i forget like 1991 or something
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:25.800]   So it's an industrial lubricant and that's now discovered that hey, it has health benefits, right?
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.440]   And that was discovered when that 2012 rat study came out so
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:38.520]   What's cool though, uh is that there are studies about c60 in regards to health and it's not 100
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.400]   Industrial, uh, and so this is the cool part
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.960]   So I did find five studies that I want to share with you
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:50.760]   And I think from my scouring of the internet, it's pretty much the only studies that were done last year
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:57.560]   Uh, but the but they're all very promising. I mean the very first one's called wound healing activity of aqueous dispersion of fullerene
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:05.720]   60 produced by green technology. All right. What did they do? They basically gave they they basically cut a mouse and gave them a wound poor
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.360]   Little guy, um, and then they basically treated that mouse with c60 topically
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:16.920]   Uh, and so and this was the uh, uh, the solution that the c60 was suspended in but you know at the end of the day
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.440]   As you can see from these little pictures from the from the report and here's the
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.400]   Uh, the statement out of the abstract for this study
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:29.000]   The ability of the afd to exhibit regenerative activity was studied using the animal wound model
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.840]   This study show us for the first time that the fullerene base composition
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:39.000]   Stimulates the healing of wounds of various origins. So there you go c60 is good for wounds
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.400]   And you know in the telegram chat group, uh, it's it's been commented before
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:49.000]   Uh, that people have taken the regular old c60 oil that they ingest and put it on wounds and it actually does help
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.920]   So so this is just a study that validates that but it's kind of a pretty interesting
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:58.200]   Uh, you know application for c60 if you haven't considered it before. Oh, by the way, all of the
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.600]   Studies i'll be talking about will the links will be in the video description
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:10.760]   You can pop over and read the whole study yourself. Okay, next study is called in vivo in vtro and in silico anti-cancer investigation
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:18.440]   Of fullerene c60 on dmba induced breast cancer in rats. So what these guys did was, you know, they basically got
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.960]   I think it was will star rats with our genetically predisposed for
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:27.880]   Cancers and so they basically got some will star rats which are lab certified quality lab quality rats
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:33.160]   For their study that developed cancers and then they treated them with fullerene c60 the
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.720]   The results from the abstract state plate
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.280]   Fullerene c60 decreases breast cancer by decreasing mda level
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:48.440]   Increases gsh level and catalyst activity and thus it protect breast tissue against cancer
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.680]   So it this is very important, especially if you're a mouse, right
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:58.600]   Uh that taking c60 is preventative and i'm just gonna that's my opinion
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:04.120]   Based on the study, but you know if if it works for mice, you're right. That's, you know, anyway
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:12.600]   I'm just gonna leave it there very sensitive subject, but you know, hey, um, I take c60 for all the other you know for the antioxidant and
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.680]   Anti-toxin and anti-radiation perspectives. I never really
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.960]   Considered it'd be also anti-cancer. So that's pretty cool
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.200]   next study
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:29.080]   Uh over the last year is one called fullerene c60 attenuates heart tissue inflammation by modulating cox dash two
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:36.440]   And tf nf alpha signaling pathways and dmba induced breast cancer in rats
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.720]   So I just want to tell you I'm an armchair scientist. I do not know what half of these acronyms mean
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.280]   Uh, I try to read the these and this one's particularly this was like reading
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:56.680]   Stereo instructions in a language using a translation application on my phone with a bad battery. It was really really hard to read
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.840]   Uh, but you know, I kind of ferried it out like okay. Well, what did you do?
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.000]   And basically, um, they got rats that are you know predisposed to
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:12.520]   Uh breast cancer and also then gave them some kind of poison and then they gave them c60 to see what the c60 would do
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.440]   Uh to the you know to these little rats that had to deal with this poison
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.680]   Uh, and so what happened was is that this is actually right out of the work study
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:27.320]   Fullerene c60 nanoparticle may be promising and effective therapy for the treatment of heart diseases
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:33.080]   Associated with inflammation, right? So that's what they discovered and that was their finding from the study
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.960]   And you know, and that's something that you know, it's kind of like
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.440]   Normal. I mean that's a very normal finding. It's great to see that they did a study
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:46.120]   But you know all of the earlier studies show because c60 is such an incredible antioxidant
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:52.440]   Uh, it'll go in there and sponge up and scavenge all your free radicals right and free radicals is is what's causing
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:58.280]   Inflammation in your body. So of course it grows to figure that you know, hey c60 will reduce the inflammation
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:03.000]   Uh, and then in this particular study they studied the heart and so it definitely would help with
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.840]   Reducing inflammation and heart tissue. So that's really great. So people with heart problems
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.440]   You know, this might be helpful opinion again. Not uh, it's fact
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:17.080]   All right next study that has come up in the last year is a new one another new one
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:23.800]   Uh called c60 fullerene attenuates muscle force reduction in a rat during fatigue development
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.480]   Okay, so this one basically I think they made the little rats run a treadmill. I'm joking
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:33.560]   Uh, sorry, uh, but you know bottom line is that they they they they force rats into a stress situation
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.640]   Uh to look at
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.640]   How c60 would help
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.040]   Um, they're their muscle and so here's the finding is in the in the study
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.760]   The obtained results indicate that the prospect of using c60 as a potential protective
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.240]   Nano agent to improve the efficiency of skeletal muscle functioning or function
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:57.720]   By modifying the reactive oxygen species dependent mechanisms that play in an important role in the process of muscle
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.960]   Fatigue development. Okay. So now they've proven this in rats and what does that mean?
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   Is it helps you recover from strenuous workouts? And you know what?
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.040]   There's a ton
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.360]   Of biohacking athletes that already know that and that's why they take c60
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.720]   It is it is if you are a person who works out in a gym and you've got your objectives
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.080]   And you know, it's no pain. No gain. Well, you can kind of get that pain go away
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.440]   Uh by taking c60 it actually helps because it just sponges up all that free radical stuff
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:31.320]   It reduces inflammation and it helps you recover from muscle fatigue
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.240]   Much better than if you didn't take c60. So that's pretty cool, right?
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.720]   That there's a study now that says that but you know, we've known that athletes have known that for quite a while
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.800]   Those who take c60. So the next one here. I want to kind of share with you
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:49.400]   Uh, is called effective c60 full arena on recovery of muscle solace and rats
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:55.080]   After atropi induced by a killing tannatomi. Okay
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.360]   Sorry, the findings on this one
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:03.240]   Was essentially, uh, they had they did something to these poor little guys
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:08.040]   And caused them to have muscle atropi. That's when your muscle shrink down from lack of usage
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.640]   You know, if you've ever broke a leg or arm, you'll know what happens to your muscles, right?
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.480]   So then of course then they treated them with c60 and so these rats
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:23.480]   The findings of this study was the obtained results indicate a promising prospect for c60 full arena used as a powerful antioxidant
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:30.520]   For reducing and correcting pathological conditions of the muscular system arising from skeletal muscle atrophy
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:35.480]   So yes, it did help the rats recover from atrophy. So, you know, these are the five
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:39.160]   The last one here is not necessarily a c60, but I think it's wild
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:44.120]   I ran across it while doing this research and I wanted to share it with you because it's a derivative of c60
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.120]   But you know the five I've kind of just shared with you
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.760]   I really just want to re-inform, you know, just reiterate
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:54.120]   Is, you know, how cool that we've got these studies coming out now and they're they're basically reinforcing
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.440]   What the community has experienced?
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.920]   But now that there's studies that then reinforce that hey, yeah, that's really going to happen
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:06.920]   So we're talking about c60 is good for wound healing. Yeah, it's good for breast cancer. It's good for heart problems
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:11.240]   It's good for recovering from workouts and it's also good from recovering from atrophy
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.680]   So you know what? I I think this is a really good thing for c60
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.240]   I'm glad that see these studies are continuing to be done and it's continually reinforcing
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:23.080]   You know the folks that made that decision to become part of the human trial
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.280]   You know, so it I find it encouraging. There you go. So the last study now and this is a full and all
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.840]   This is not c60 whenever you see the phrase walked or solvable c60
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.160]   That means it's not c60
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.680]   It is called a full and all and a full and all is a c60 molecule
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:46.600]   With oxygen hydrogen atom stuck to it. Okay, which if you add an extra atom
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:53.560]   It changes the molecular the molecule and it becomes a different thing and that different thing is called a florinol
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.760]   Okay
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.440]   And so there are some people out there who have developed products with florinols
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:04.200]   And they're making this you know kind of like fuzzy line, you know with uh, you know calling it like
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:11.800]   C60, but you know, it's not c60. I did a whole video about this last year, but anyway, I digress
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:18.760]   So here's the study though, and I think it's really cool because now it's kind of got me interested like I'm pulling all but water soluble
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.320]   Alanine modified fullerene c60
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:27.160]   Promotes the proliferation and neural differentiation of neural stem cells
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.800]   So again because I'm doing this stem cell project right now and I'm like wow that really perk my interest
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:36.200]   So that's pretty cool. So they've taken florinols and they've basically did a study
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:45.800]   On how florinols affect stem cell generation right neural stem cells and the findings strongly indicate that the alla which stands for alanine modified
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.760]   fullerene c60
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:54.600]   Has high potential to be applied as a scaffold with nsfnses
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:00.040]   For regeneration in nerve tissue engineering for diseases related to the nervous system
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.480]   So that is really cool because you know what's a nervous
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:10.120]   Uh, you know, and you know what a disease for related nervous systems in your head is. Yeah, it's things like to mention Alzheimer's
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.600]   Isn't that one of the biggest, uh, you know epidemics of our of our generation?
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:19.720]   You know our our in Hawaii we call them our kapuna, you know our elders, right? And it's just so
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:24.040]   Devastatingly, uh, you know heartbreaking to watch our elders
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:32.600]   Diminished in such mental capacity and here is something that's coming along saying a c60 or a derivative of a c60
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:38.200]   Uh, you know is is is most likely helpful for that and just off the bat c60
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.640]   Right itself has been found to help quite a few elders
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:48.040]   Uh regain their faculties and there are several test testimonies out there. No human trials again. There's no human studies
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:54.600]   Uh, but you know those are those have been some of the testimonials coming out that c60 just by itself is helpful as very helpful
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.640]   For neural degenerative types of issues for people
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:03.880]   Uh, and then here's one a study now that's come out about that from a from a you know from a lab standpoint
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.280]   So, uh, so it is it's encouraging again. It's just one more I think it's one more data point
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.360]   You know to for the concept of hey c60 good or bad, right?
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.400]   Uh, anyway, so that's that so I just want to say thank you. That's my
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.360]   C60 a year in review. I wanted to just share with you what my findings are
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.960]   Um, and I do you know I do once a year kind of go back to c60
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.480]   It's kind of how I started my youtube channel, which is all about c60 back then
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.680]   Uh, but you know you just kind of run out of stuff to talk about so you know
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.120]   I'll try to keep doing it once a year just to kind of say, hey, where are we what's been going on?
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.920]   I hope you found this informative and and helpful if you have any questions. Hey, you know what?
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.160]   We still got our c60 chat group on telegram. It's been going all these years
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:49.160]   It's still there uh link below in the in the video description if you got any questions about c60 how to make c60
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.360]   Um, you know, yeah, come on down. I'll be more than happy to chat with you and answer your questions on telegram
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:22:00.200]   So thank you for your time today. I did again. I hope you found this informative and you know what have a great day. Aloha
