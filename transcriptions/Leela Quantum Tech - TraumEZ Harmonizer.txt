[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K. Elmer and in
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.240]   this video I've got Phillip Von Holtsendorff, the CEO and founder and owner and operator and
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.680]   everything for Layla Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade with me. Aloha Phillip, how are you today?
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.720]   I'm great. How are you K? Thanks for having me on.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.040]   It's great. It's early and it's starting to get cold where I'm at so it's really refreshing.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.120]   I'm enjoying it. So today, a real special treat everyone. I've got Phillip on a call
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.000]   to announce this long-awaited that was announced like a year ago but now it's here.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.840]   A brand new service that's specific towards overcoming trauma and so I asked Phillip to join me on a
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.800]   call. I'd like to go ahead and just pick his brain about it and it launches on Tuesday, October 10,
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.360]   correct? Yes, that is correct. All right, so this thing is going to go live.
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.240]   Yeah, so that's pretty cool. So let's talk about it but before we jump into that everybody,
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.600]   you know we got our deal of disclaimers. Nobody wants to get sued so let me go ahead and get
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.840]   through this real quick. Now neither Layla Quantum Tech nor the Tinkers Academy recommend or endorse
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.080]   any specific tests, physicians, procedures, opinions or other information that may be mentioned
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.000]   in this video. Reliance on any information appearing and discussing this video solely at

[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.400]   so what we're going to do is it's basically just kind of just put out some general questions.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.040]   We're going to have a two-part series. This is to introduce the service, kind of explain what
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.760]   it's all about. And then there's going to be a part two where we're going to do after the
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.280]   service has been going on for a few weeks, we're going to collect any questions you have.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.080]   So if you have questions after you sign up or anything in general, post them on Telegram
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.280]   in our Telegram chat group. We're going to collect those questions and do a follow-up Q&A video
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.560]   to answer all of the questions regarding the service just like we did with the upgrade
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.320]   service. Okay, and also, you know, I'll probably try to build in, you know, kind of a tutorial as
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.280]   well. But this video is just to announce the new service and what it's all about. And I
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.360]   read through the whole thing full up last night and it sounds amazing. So my very first question
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.440]   for you, you know, it's like, okay, so like, what is this? You know, what is this is the webpage for
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.000]   it? So, you know, what is trauma? Are we calling it trauma ease or trauma easy?
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.880]   Traum easy. That's how we call it. And you know, the original idea was to call it the trauma release
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:46.720]   harmonizer. And then we, you know, we always are mindful of what the FDA does and things and all
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.200]   of that, even though, you know, it's kind of a pain. But just out of precaution, we did not call it a
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:03.200]   trauma release. We call it trauma easy. And but basically, it really is the main goal is here to
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.240]   overcome trauma, as you said, but it can do way more than that, actually. So it's a whole bundle
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.720]   of things that you can do with it. But that's the main, main thing. Yeah, when I read through the
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.960]   website, I was pretty amazed at what other claims that are made. So I like, you know, let's if we
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.320]   had time, let's go through some of those. But the very first question, though, is, okay, so this is
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.680]   not just specific to trauma. It also can deal with EMF. It can deal with you can now charge
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.080]   food and water, right? And so forth, you know, through quantum entanglement, just like, is this
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.920]   correct? So I'm just, you know, right? I mean, I'm just paraphrasing the website, but is that
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.240]   is that kind of like what it does and what it is? Sort of indeed. Now in the sense where you have
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.160]   the phone, it's not really the quantum entanglement anymore, because the it'll be uploaded on your
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.880]   phone. That's that's how it works. Oh, once you sign up, you know, it'll be uploaded on your phone,
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:12.400]   and basically the energy will be on your phone. And then with that, you basically EMFs all around
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:21.120]   your phone will be completely harmonized. That's one thing. Then you could indeed transform and
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:30.400]   harmonize toxins, pesticides, heavy metals, whatever, including microwaves also and chemical residues,
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:37.760]   free radicals, all of that into life force energy or life energy is, I think, how we call it on the
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:45.360]   website. And that's because the energy is being transmitted from your phone. So you would need to
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.400]   use your phone to do that. And the reason why we chose the phone is because everyone has one,
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   right? And everyone has also an issue with the phone, because if you have a phone and you're not
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:07.200]   already using one of our systems, basically, then you're always dealing with EMFs. So that's
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.040]   the first thing that takes takes care of that, basically. And then it does all these other
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.240]   great things. And then obviously, the main thing is to really work on trauma, which
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.200]   it was a very long development. I mean, you know, you guys in the Telegram group,
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.200]   you know, you probably know better than me. But I think we've been talking about this
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:35.280]   almost since a year and a half to make this happen. But it's, yeah, it took some development
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.160]   time is this stuff isn't easy. And you know, we need to make sure everything is covered,
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:48.000]   everything works 100% at all times. And yeah, now we're here and it's super exciting and happy to
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.280]   talk about all the details of what it can do and how to use it. Okay, that's pretty okay. So that's
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.080]   amazing. Yeah, I didn't make that connection. When I read the material and it mentioned that
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.760]   you needed the phone, I was thinking like, you know, how the quantum upgrade service uses the phone,
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.280]   you know, it sends it can send energy to the phone. So you're saying that your phone becomes the
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.680]   quantum device. Once you download this app onto it, right, then it turns your phone into a quantum
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.280]   device. That's pretty much what you're saying. Okay. All right, let's talk about that. So before
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:30.960]   we get into that though, what I'd like to understand is so is that this is not a new thing. I just
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.560]   because one of the things I want to I'd like to emphasize, you'd mentioned this in another video
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.680]   you and I chatted way back in the day where, you know, you were you were working in partnership with
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.920]   one of the Leila network healers, another healer and his name is Johan, right? And Austria. Yep.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:52.240]   Can you talk about that? Like what what what what is the the foundation of this new service that
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.200]   you've now combined with Leila Q and created this incredible new service? Like, you know, like,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:05.840]   what is like what's the history of that? So Johan is he's a he's a very special and gifted
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:13.840]   clairvoyant who lives in Austria. And he's he's an amazing person, you know, he's similar to Roman,
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:22.720]   he's he's extremely advanced in the way he sees energy and perceives energy and he's been helping
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:31.040]   people for quite a long time. And he basically specialized in trauma work. That was really
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:41.520]   his main thing. And he developed at some point a combination of energies and and with certain steps
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.080]   if you would go through those in combination with that energy is almost like I think of it as like
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:56.400]   opening a portal to an energy that makes it very easy for you to release trauma to identify trauma
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:03.040]   to to release it and to really transform it and then to refill that space with love
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:08.240]   and and life energy, right? That's that's also quite important. So that's basically what he had
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:14.720]   focused on and hundreds and hundreds and then thousands and thousands of people would go to him
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.520]   to get their trauma released with that method. So then, you know, he was thinking about, you know,
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:28.720]   how he could do that in a way where he doesn't need to be present, okay? And then he developed that
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:40.400]   basically. And when when we talked and quite a bit, then both of us had the had the impulse that we
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:49.200]   should combine what we developed with Lila Quantum Tech and what he developed and see what it does.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:55.360]   And it almost felt like he called it like a like a marriage made in heaven like between the two
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:03.680]   technologies that we indeed combined and then what happened. So usually if he if there was a
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:13.440]   work done with his system of trauma, any trauma basically, they could release and transform within,
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:20.400]   you know, 45 to 50 minutes, in some cases, 60 minutes. That's that's how long it took until
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:27.360]   that trauma was really dealt with and transformed and really transformed on all levels. Like,
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:34.080]   we're not just talking some energetic, you know, yeah, you just transform just on an energetic
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:40.880]   level. No, this is transformed on three different levels, literally in the physical and the emotional
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:51.200]   on the soul level. And it is it happens in a way where there's an, no, I don't know the word right
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:10:00.560]   now, but it's that you understand why that happened to you, which is actually a very important process
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:09.120]   for releasing a trauma that you understand, why that happens, and that you'll be able to also
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:14.640]   refill this space, because what happens with the trauma is that you have a lot of bound energy,
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.440]   right, and stuck energy. And it's basically something where that becomes a baggage. You know,
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:25.760]   we call this the the the stuff, the heavy stuff and weights in your backpack, right? And if you
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:33.200]   and you can, if you transform it, and then you can refill this whole space with with life energy,
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:40.080]   then then it's just an amazing feeling and you can move on you don't ever have to deal with this
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:47.200]   again. Of course, with some traumas, there are multiple layers, right? And you may find with some,
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:54.560]   I don't know if you had a mother that beat you all the time and did all these different things,
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:02.000]   there's there's a lot of work you can do regarding that, right? And that applies to many other things
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.640]   as well. There's, you know, it doesn't mean there's just one word. Anyway, now coming back to that.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:15.760]   So when we combined the technologies, it was possible to basically release the trauma in about
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:23.840]   five minutes. And it happened over and over again. Yeah, exactly. And and so that's basically what
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:32.000]   we're talking about here. And and it's and then the beauty is everyone can do that on his her own.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.840]   Like you literally like once you signed up, you within 10 to 30 minutes, you'll have your phone
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:47.920]   activated. And it will stay activated as long as you stay a member, basically. And you can
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:53.200]   cancel any time. But then, you know, once you cancel, that's not it doesn't doesn't work anymore.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   So, and then you just you there's there's basically like a PDF, I think that we have on the website,
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:09.840]   where, yeah, that's the one where it shows the different steps that you would would go through.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:15.840]   And you can literally do that at home on the sofa, on your own, like you take your time, you
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:22.880]   know, with yourself, you you think about you. And some traumas, obviously, we know about, you know,
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:29.840]   that we have those, or we think there may be a trauma, right? Those are the first spots to go
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:36.880]   to, obviously, or if we have children, and we may know what their trauma is, then we can also,
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:43.280]   you know, do that with them, right? Obviously. And then you have traumas that you don't know,
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:49.360]   you even have, right? So, but you can you can you can start digging, you can can start guessing,
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:56.880]   and yeah, you may get an impulse out of a dream. So, any of those you can you can actually work on.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:05.680]   And it's, it's quite impactful. But, but again, we didn't want to just stop there. So, this
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:14.480]   energy on the phone, you know, is basically working 24/7, to help with certain things,
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:20.320]   like we just alluded to earlier. Okay. No, that's pretty amazing. So, it's, it's a,
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.720]   turns your phone into a quantum device. But the key here, I think that, you know, I think we need
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.920]   to convey to everybody that it's not, it's not like the quantum upgrade. It's not like energy
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.120]   is just going to your phone, and then you don't do anything to actually go through this traumas
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.720]   easy, is that you need to work with it, and you need to have follow certain steps, right,
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:48.000]   as outlined in the PDF. So, in this guidebook, it walks you through the nine steps. You need to
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.880]   follow and then use your phone as the quantum device to, you know, to basically overcome those
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:00.240]   traumas. So, it's definitely have to participate. You actually have to do stuff. It's not just going
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:06.800]   to happen, right? Correct. For the trauma release, for sure, you need to go through these steps,
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.360]   which is, which is very important, but it's super easy also. I mean, it's, you know, it's not like,
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:19.920]   you need to be an expert or something like anyone that can read and just think as an
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:25.760]   almost human being, you're able to do that. It's really simple. For the other things, you know,
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:33.600]   that you have harmonization and what we just discussed, you don't need to really do anything.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.400]   Okay. So, I think, yeah, in terms of like a tutorial on how to use it, I think we can kind of do
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:43.920]   later. This is a more of an intro. So, this is what it can do and what the history of it is. So,
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:51.520]   it's, you know, it's pretty amazing. So, bottom line is this thing launches on Tuesday. And if
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:58.400]   people are interested in using their phone as a quantum device to help themselves heal for trauma,
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:06.560]   also using it to mitigate, you know, toxins and radiation and charge food and stuff like that,
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.840]   you can also use your phone as the quantum device to do so. And I guess we'll have more
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.720]   instructions coming out on how to do that. So, those are the things that this does.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:24.640]   And obviously, you know, since Johannes has been working on this for his career, his lifetime,
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.440]   and then you two have now combined through the network to produce it. But, you know, I saw that
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.440]   there's actually like testimonials here on the very bottom. So, like, did it go like, what kind of a,
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:41.280]   like, did you have a bunch of people sign up or, you know, test, test guinea pig folks? You know,
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:48.000]   what was the feedback from the first group, I guess, of testers that tried this out? Because
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.360]   it looks like they were pretty, pretty happy with the results. Yeah. So, I think we have,
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:16:00.960]   we had over 50 test persons. Okay. Most of the vast majority in Europe, because that was just
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:09.280]   technically easier to do it that way. And it was, it was overseen. And yeah, I mean, it's, it's,
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:16.960]   it's just overwhelmingly positive. Like, people just feel relieved. They feel lighter after that.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:22.240]   They, they, they literally feel that something happens. Like, it's, it's with each of those steps,
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.880]   like, and you do a self-assessment, you know, within those, like, let's say, you know, where,
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:33.520]   where you just showed on the PDF, the different steps, like, um, one step three, for example,
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:39.920]   you'll see right the emotion of this trauma from zero to 10, where zero is no trauma at all,
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:47.680]   and 10 is a severe trauma. Like you, with that, you, you need to feel what it is. And there's no
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.800]   right or wrong again, right? It's just your feeling. And if you feel that it feels so
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:59.600]   freaking heavy, like, it does. And then, but you'll notice how, how that changes. You literally
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:05.600]   notice how it changes in the end, you'll notice it's not there anymore. Like, you, you, you look
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.200]   for it and you, you can't find it anymore. And that's, that's the point where the trauma is released
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:18.320]   and where it's transformed. So it is quite noticeable, actually. So this is, this is, this is, this is,
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:24.240]   I think it's very noticeable even for people that can't sense very much, because if you're
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:32.080]   going through this step process, um, somehow it forces you to feel and be relatively easy to feel,
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:38.080]   and you'll see something happens there. That's amazing. No, no, it's, I'm, yeah, that's pretty
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:44.160]   amazing. So you had 50 person test group and it's been a year and a half and in the works and now
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.440]   we're going to release this. So it's pretty exciting. So now there's different ways people can sign up,
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.960]   correct? And so I want to kind of point that out. You can sign up as an individual, or you can sign
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.600]   up as a family. So I guess the, we'll get into the pricing here in a different, but if you sign
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.960]   up as a family, it's up to five people. I want to talk about this right here where, you know,
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:13.840]   what to expect. Once your phone becomes a quantum device, it's got a 23 foot, uh, I guess, uh, diameter,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:18.560]   right, uh, field around it. So now it becomes like a little, does it, would you say that it's kind of
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:25.680]   becomes like a little block at that point? Or is it more like a, like a card, like a really powerful
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.480]   capsule or something? I would, you know, like, yeah, I would, I would say it's like a very powerful
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:38.400]   capsule, or a combination of the two, or like a hybrid, something like that. Yeah, because there's,
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:44.080]   yeah, it's, it's more than the other and it's less than the other, but it's, it's then very,
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:50.720]   it's very specific with the energy, right? It's different also. It's because the block, again, would be
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:58.880]   just a neutral, pure quantum energy field. And this is, this is a very specific energy that it
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:06.080]   carries. So it's, it's really a combination. It's, it's an orchestra that plays, if you will.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.800]   Okay. All right. And so you kind of use it like a capsule where if you want to charge
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.960]   foods and water, you put it near, put your phone next to it. I'm assuming your phone has to be
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:21.440]   turned on, like it has to be powered to use it. No. Oh, okay. So your phone just becomes a device.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.520]   Wow. That's pretty cool. Okay. So those are the different statements and claims that are being
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:30.240]   made in there. And I think one of the interesting things here, if we could just touch on this,
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.200]   because it's come up, I don't know why it came up, but it came up last month,
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:39.520]   where this whole dark energy thing, and I, you guys came out with a protection frequency on upgrade
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:46.240]   specific to that, right? Which is individuals out there who may be dealing with energy vampires,
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.040]   if you know what I mean, or just negative energies, either where there it's from people or
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.560]   what's, you know, the remnants of people in your, in your space. But so there's a frequency now
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:03.040]   on upgrade, but you're saying also that the, the trauma easy energy can also be used to
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:09.040]   basically exercise trap souls and kind of deal with that dark energy as well on top of all the
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:15.040]   other things that it can do. Is that correct? That is correct. Yeah. Okay. That's pretty wild.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:20.960]   Okay. So now this is the homepage for trauma easy. It's everybody. And that PDF that we're talking
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:26.560]   about right here is at the bottom of the page. So the actual instructions on how to use it for
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:32.400]   trauma easy is right here in your, in your guide. So you'd want to go ahead and go to the home page,
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:38.320]   take a look at the guide, understand how it works, and then how you sign up is right here. You just
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.800]   pick which one that you want to sign up for. So before we get into the pricing, though, Phillip,
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.400]   you know, one of the things that really popped up in my mind when I read all of this was,
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:54.800]   you know, like, how does it compare, right? To someone who, you know, owns a capsule or or
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:00.160]   specifically own a block. And then all of a sudden, you know, there's this upgrade service,
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.640]   which now really just gives you so much more features and customized ability. And now that
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:10.080]   with the frequencies in there, it's really, really, really, really super handy is, you know, just
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:14.960]   really much more convenient. But then you've got this third service now, and there seems to be a
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:20.800]   lot of overlapping. So I know our, I know our members. And the first question I think everyone's
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:27.600]   going to ask is like, well, if I already have a block, or if I already subscribe to the U service,
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:34.480]   and I'm doing frequencies, should I, you know, and obviously, first question is, is if I get
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:40.240]   the trauma easy and I start using that, does it affect any of the other ones? First question.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:47.760]   No, so it does not negatively affect each other in any way would rather
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:54.880]   positively amplify everything. And I think a very important thing is so if you're already
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:03.760]   using the quantum upgrade and or lead a quantum technology, then you do not need this unless
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:09.760]   you want to work on trial laws, right? Because, you know, all these other things like charging your
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:17.600]   foods and in harmonizing toxins, well, you couldn't do that really with the quantum
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:23.600]   upgrade, to be honest, right? So obviously, you know, you couldn't put your bread. You would need a
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:31.200]   block to put your bread in there and neutralize the gluten and all that. So, but if you have a block,
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:39.040]   let's just say you have a block, you can literally do all these things here, except the trauma
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:47.600]   work, because that really is a very specific set of energies and frequencies that even allows that
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   this happens. So if you're not interested in any trauma release, then you don't need this
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:23:02.720]   if you have a block. Now, if you, you know, don't have a block, then obviously,
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:09.440]   you may be interested in the trauma work, but you may also be interested in all these other
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:16.240]   things that it does, right? So it, yeah, there's some overlap. Of course, and I think this is
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.800]   actually great, because I think it's very beneficial. We wanted to make it a really
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:28.720]   comprehensive set that you then have on your phone. But the main thing really is where it's
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:34.960]   different from, from all the other products out there that we have is the trauma release.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.520]   Oh, thanks for that. Yeah. Okay. So now, yeah, I understand it better now. Each one of these
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:46.960]   services and product sets have a very distinct advantage and a very specific, you know, benefit.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:52.480]   And so, so this one here, if you've already got the block, then, you know, then, and you're fine
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.960]   with being able to charge food and all that. And if you got the upgrade service and you've got the
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:02.640]   positive energy coming to you, you can use frequencies, but you can't charge food and water. But neither
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:09.760]   one of those two things, if you really are focused on trauma work, then this is the service. And really
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:15.520]   honestly, just use it until you're free. And then that's the whole point of it, right? Is that it
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:20.880]   goes fairly quickly, but you work with it. And the major benefit of this is to helping people
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:26.160]   release trauma. So okay, so that's how it compares to the other services. Thanks for that. Now,
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.240]   the next one too, you know, it's like, there's a lot of folks out there that are going to ask,
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.840]   you know, okay, well, I can definitely work on myself, but you know, can I sign someone else up
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:43.040]   for this? What's your answer to that? Because, you know, we get that a lot in the upgrade service,
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.520]   right? And that's what the sharing features for. So, but if like, let's say, you know, like,
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:52.800]   I'm a parent and I have a child and they're just going through some rough bullying or whatever at
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:59.920]   school or, you know, whatever, you know, can I sign up a child for this or sign up a spouse or a
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:05.520]   parent or a sister? You know, okay, so then, but they still have to do the work, right? It just
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.920]   doesn't happen. Not like, you know, the upgrade service to me is just a beautiful thing where
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.920]   you could sign up somebody and all of a sudden their world gets bathed in positive energy.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.320]   Nobody's got to do anything, right? But this one, you have to act, you have to participate.
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:25.520]   So, well, you also get in positive energy automatically because as soon as it's turned on,
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:32.160]   and you have, as long as you have your phone somewhere near you, then you're already benefiting
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:38.880]   from the positive energy 100%. So that that instantly starts as soon as it's activated.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:44.560]   For the trauma work, indeed, you know, if they want to release specific traumas, then there's,
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.840]   you know, they need to go through the steps. That's correct.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:55.040]   All right. Okay. And then, okay, so that's basically one of your FAQs. All right. So then,
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.400]   in terms of pricing and how this is working, so the concept here is you can sign up for a single,
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:06.640]   which is $20 a month and a one time $35 sign up fee, right? And so if I want to subscribe,
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:12.000]   I just hit subscribe, and then it's going to go into the cart, and then I could look at the cart,
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:18.000]   and then right here, and then it's basically the 20 and the 35 combined, and that's
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.720]   just the one time, and then it's 20 a month afterwards, and you go ahead and check out.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:28.480]   And I don't have the, well, this won't be the tutorial on what to do next, but I'm assuming
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.200]   if you can kind of walk everybody through what to expect next after they hit checkout.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:41.040]   So after the checkout, just you put in your information and the payment information and
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:48.400]   everything. I think at this point, it's a credit card that's required for this.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:55.920]   I don't think PayPal is an option. And yeah, then you just go through, and once you clicked,
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:04.320]   and the last time, which is submitted basically, and it's all placed, then within 10 to 30 minutes,
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:12.640]   the whole thing is activated, and then it's on your phone. I mean, if you're sensitive,
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:18.320]   you will feel it, you will see it on your phone once it's active. If you're unsure,
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:25.840]   then definitely just wait 30 minutes, at least until you do your first trauma work.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:34.480]   So usually it should happen within 10 to 15 minutes, but there's, we build in a buffer just
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.840]   in case, and that's why we're saying 10 to 30 minutes in case there's ever any technical delays.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.720]   Does the person have to actually download an app onto their phone?
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:53.280]   Nope. We call it an app at some places, but it's not, it's being uploaded energetically,
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:59.440]   basically. Oh, okay. Okay. Cool. All right. And so then your phone just starts emanating this
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:05.120]   energy. And so there's no real indication as when you can start working with it, you just kind of
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:10.080]   just wait 30 minutes, and after you hit subscribe and, and then it just starts automatically. Is that
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:15.360]   correct? Correct. And then there's, it's really totally up to you. You know, how often you want
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:22.480]   to use it for a trauma work, because, you know, that's really totally up to you. You can, you know,
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:29.200]   do it 10 times a day. You can do it once a week. It really depends on you and how you feel.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.920]   You know, whenever you feel you want to work on something or release something, then you just
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:39.680]   do it. And it's again, you know, it's as easy as laying on the sofa and going through the process.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:45.760]   Okay. And then I'm assuming that it keys off of the phone number, right? So, you know,
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.680]   that's the key to this entire service. Is it ties to the phone number?
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:55.200]   Yes, that's a great question. I'm glad you asked because indeed, so you wouldn't want to put
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:02.000]   a wrong phone number in, make sure you have the correct phone number. And that was the
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.320]   absolute key. Otherwise, it wouldn't work for your phone and would work for someone else's phone.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:12.160]   Okay. And that's only smartphone devices or let's say, you know, I don't know anybody who has, but
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:19.600]   if somebody only has a landline, would that work in this regard? Or is we're talking about portable
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:25.200]   phones, right? No, we're just talking portable phones. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Okay.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:33.040]   All right. So then now if I wanted to sign up my family, then every person that I want to sign up,
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:38.080]   just I have to have the phone number for that individual. And I put that into the subscription,
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:45.600]   right? So if I hit subscribe to family and I go to cart, that's $30 a month, by the way,
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:51.840]   it's family as single as 20 a month, family is 30, and that's up to five people. Obviously,
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:57.600]   if you're married, it's way cheaper to go with a family. But and it's still just a flat 35 sign
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:03.600]   up fee. So you just get charged that first month. Let me show the zero. You get charged that
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:08.560]   just just real quick for people to understand why there's this. And just for people to understand
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.960]   why there's a sign up here, because usually we don't have that, right? So we don't have that
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:19.440]   with quantum upgrade, but here it really is an effort. So there's real work involved
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:26.560]   to get this done, so that this is uploaded on your phone, that it's fully working and activated.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:32.960]   And that's why there is this activation fee, basically. Okay. Okay. No, that's good. Thank
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:38.560]   you for sharing. Okay. So now this is the family one. And so I noticed that it's just asking for
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:45.280]   me, the guy that's signing up, everybody. And and of course, the monthly for that and a sign up.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:52.240]   So when I hit subscribe for family, this is obviously my phone number. So is there going to be a separate
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.240]   page out there that says, giving you all the five phone numbers?
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:03.040]   There should be. Yes. Okay. So that's where you would enter the other four phone numbers.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.720]   And then if I ever had to change your phone number, is that something where I have to do
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:15.840]   contact Emma and Layla support, or is there a dashboard where I can change phone numbers
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:22.160]   as I need to? Customer service. Okay. And the family, like definition of family is basically,
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:26.480]   you're just paying for five people and it doesn't matter how they're related. It's just called the
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:33.840]   family plan. I mean, in essence, yeah. So I mean, it really is meant to be for a family, but hey,
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:39.280]   you know, I mean, if you have four roommates that are not your family, then, you know, you can do
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:44.880]   that too. Okay. All right. It ultimately is, you know, it's about the phone numbers.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:50.960]   Okay. So yeah, so you sign up five phones. Okay. That's great. Now let's see. We kind of talked
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:56.000]   about all of that stuff. And one thing that I did notice was this little statement down here that
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.720]   so you guys. So now this one is a service you're actually offering a 30 day money back guarantee.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.080]   Can you describe what that is?
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:15.600]   Yeah. So that is for if you're not satisfied, which hasn't happened, we don't expect that to
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.480]   happen with anyone again, because it's actually quite noticeable and people will notice it and
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:28.560]   we trust that everyone is also honest about it and doesn't want to, you know, just do a return
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:36.400]   for no reason, basically, then you would get the membership fee back, you know, if within the first
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:42.880]   30 days you say, you know, well, I tried this and it didn't work for me. You'll get it back.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:49.920]   Okay. So yeah, so it's kind of a different version of the seven day fee trial for upgrade.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:55.280]   Now it's a 30 day money back on TROM EZ. So so yeah, so just want I wanted to point that out.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:33:00.800]   So that's your pricing everybody. It's either 20 or 30 a month, one person or five people,
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:07.840]   30 day money back guarantee. And of course, the instructions are in the PDF. So I guess my last
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:12.320]   questions, you know, and I really appreciate your time this morning to share this. This,
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:16.720]   you know, I guess one of the things too, you know, when I actually was looking at your website and
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:22.000]   you actually did have a page on what is trauma and you know, and I think that's I think the last
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.280]   thing I'd like to just kind of talk about are maybe if you could share is like, what are the
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.680]   success stories that you're aware of so far? Because one of the things you actually mentioned
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:40.800]   here and it's also actually also in the PDF, it's not just trauma that we experience, but it's also
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:46.960]   the trauma of our ancestors. And you hear that term in other, you know, other healers, energy
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:52.560]   workers that I've dealt with where they talk about ancestral trauma. You know, and that is
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.560]   something where, and I just wanted to point that out to people who've never heard that term, but,
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:03.680]   you know, if you have an irrational fear that you have no idea why you are afraid of spiders or
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:08.320]   falling or, or, you know, being alone or whatever those things are, but there's no point in your
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:13.600]   life. You ever had a bad experience with that? Well, it's because it carries forward. It's
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.080]   ancestral trauma. Something happened in the past, and there's actual science behind that
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:23.680]   where it gets wrapped into your DNA. And so you end up like, you know, the next generations, all of a
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:29.760]   sudden, you know, afraid of big tigers, because the first generation, you know, got eaten by
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:34.720]   saber-toots, you know, things like that. So, so I kind of, if you could talk about this, and this
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:40.000]   is the thing about the different types of trauma that, you know, like this one little paragraph
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.480]   here kind of covers, but like, what have you seen in terms of like people working with different
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:53.760]   kinds of trauma, like physical trauma versus emotional trauma versus mental trauma versus
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:35:00.000]   ancestral trauma? But like, what did you see when 50 people, you know, went and tried this out and
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.240]   and gave you feedback? I think that would be really, really interesting to hear.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:11.040]   Yeah, great question. And it's indeed the case that there's so many different types of traumas,
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:16.160]   and there's one more that will be like a past life trauma, one that you had, you know, there's
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:22.560]   something you went through at some point, and you also don't remember that. Or similar to that,
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:27.600]   it's something that really happens in the early childhood, where you just, you have no memories
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:34.640]   of, right? But it, but it still happened. We've, we've seen pretty much everything in, in our work in
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:43.200]   that regard. And it doesn't really matter what type of trauma it is, because it all can be released
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:53.360]   with, with this method here. And there's also not, not a huge difference actually in between the
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:36:01.520]   different kinds of traumas. It's just the difference in between okay, so how deep, how heavy is the
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:08.560]   trauma? Because if it, if it's very deep and very traumatic, then it blocks a whole lot of energy.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:15.520]   And then the middle speaking makes our lives miserable in, in this context, right, or difficult,
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:22.560]   because we, we constantly live with this bound and stuck energy, and we may react
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:29.680]   because of experiences out of this trauma, or because of the fear that something doesn't happen
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:34.560]   again, or that something touches this trauma, right? That's, that's, that's usually fear. And then we go
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:42.960]   into either avoidance or in irrational reactions. We get, we get very angry suddenly, or something
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:49.120]   like that. We don't really know why. So if it's very heavy, then you just have the most release
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:55.680]   and the relief. So it could be that even within this work that some tears or
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:05.280]   that you have some tears, some release, literally with, with physical tears. But, but yeah, you can
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:13.360]   rest assured though, and then we've seen this in, in all those tests, that usually going through
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:21.440]   trauma work, you know, if you have a, if you have a therapy, you know, and you go through that,
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:28.880]   it, it can be quite miserable at times, frankly, because they make you imagine that again,
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:36.160]   and you need to talk about it a lot. And that can be freeing, but it can also be at times really,
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:43.280]   really, you know, hard. And we haven't seen this being hard. And part of that is actually the
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:49.280]   energy field that is there. And because it, it instantly, you're working through these steps,
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:55.520]   actually relatively quickly in order to release very quickly. So there's not, you don't have to
[00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.240]   like relive this trauma or anything. Like that's not what you're doing when you're going through
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:07.760]   those steps. And, and I think again, it just, just imagine what types of different traumas you may
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:15.760]   have and just pick a couple and just go try this out. And, and if you have, if you feel fearful of
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:21.520]   like a very heavy trauma, then just pick an easy one first so that you'll see how actually simple
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:29.120]   the process is. And, and you'll, you'll notice that again, if there's a heavy trauma, there's a
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:37.680]   very strong and powerful relief and, and recharging of energy that you'll feel. And if it's just a very
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:45.360]   like tiny, subtle trauma that, you know, it never really was a big deal, then also you'll feel a
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:52.160]   less. Okay. Yeah. Because when I read the guide, the actual steps in the PDF, you know, it talked
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.000]   about, you know, being able to pull something up, but sometimes, you know, people have trauma,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:03.360]   they don't know where it came from. So this also works on that quote, unconscious trauma, correct?
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:08.880]   And that you, you're basically it's noted here in the steps, you know, the nine steps, which is
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:14.480]   basically, you know, seek out your higher self, your higher self will then tell you, right? What
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:21.040]   that unconscious trauma is, or bring it to the surface for you, you can work on it. So there's a
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.400]   lot of not just inner work, but working with your higher self, interacting with your phone as the
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:32.480]   quantum device to kind of go through this process. And if you go step by step by step and talk to
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:37.280]   your soul, which is sort of like, you know, you're phrasing here to talk to your inner self and say,
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:43.840]   hey, you know, you know, please let us know, you know, and seeking guidance from yourself,
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:50.080]   your unconscious self, correct? Yes. Yes. And so that's a great point, because some people may
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:55.840]   wonder, okay, so what if I can't name the trauma? Like, okay, no, I remember when I was seven years
[00:39:55.840 --> 00:40:03.280]   old, I had an accident with my mom in the car. And she died. And, you know, I got hurt. And
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.800]   obviously, you know, the day, you know, that was a trauma, a traumatic experience, I still need
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:13.120]   to work on it. Okay, that's very, very clear. But then what about other things where it's not
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:21.280]   clear? And in that case, you don't need to know all of that. You maybe, maybe you are, I don't know,
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:28.160]   when you see a red light, somewhere, you're always getting super angry, or you getting super sad,
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:34.400]   or whatever, you know, and that may be a bad example. But it could also be you react
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:40.320]   rationally to something or there's always like a weird emotion or stuck energy or fear or an
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:45.680]   avoidance mechanism, etc, coming up in certain situations. So you're noticing you have something
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:53.040]   there, but you don't know where it came from. But knowing how you're reacting and what it is,
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:41:00.720]   name that, then it would be it's the trauma around avoiding to take an elevator, for example, right?
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:04.400]   You don't know where it came from, but it's, you know, you obviously there's a symptom that you
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:10.720]   can't take an elevator. You always need to take the stairs because there's fear. So just name that.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:17.360]   And then that is the trauma you're going to work on. So it's relatively easy to pull in
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:24.000]   the issues you're having, because, you know, you know yourself best. And the issues you're having,
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:33.120]   the difficulties, you know, I don't know, maybe you're 25 year old man. And every time you, you
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:41.280]   know, you want to go out to a dead, you can't talk because you're, I don't know, you're scared of
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:47.280]   saying the wrong thing when you meet with a girl or something like that. So you may not know where
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:52.320]   that comes from, but you don't need to. You know what, what is the problem? So name the problem.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:57.680]   And then you can work on the problem. That's pretty much how it works.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:04.640]   Okay. So essentially unconscious trauma is what drives our anxieties, our fears,
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:09.920]   right, our trepidation and do some self reflection to figure out like, why do I feel this way?
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.960]   And then that's that's actually a trauma. And that's something that you could use this service
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:20.080]   to help alleviate. So yeah, that's, that's amazing. So that's what I got out of reading this. So,
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.760]   hey, Phillip, I know we're reaching your hard stops. So I kind of want to just say thank you for
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:27.920]   answering all of these questions. I know we're going to get a bunch more everybody. So as a
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:33.440]   reminder, you know, as you interact with the service, if you've got questions, post them on either
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.400]   group, I don't think we're going to put a new group. But I think just either group, and we'll go
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:43.120]   ahead and capture those questions and try to do our best to keep track of them and have a follow up
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:48.160]   Q&A. So Phillip, I want to say thank you so much for today. I'm so excited. You know,
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.360]   I've been waiting since the moment you announced this because we've been looking for, right?
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:56.720]   Since the beginning, we've always been looking for that trauma frequency. And there really isn't
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:02.240]   one, but you discovered this with working with Johannes. And now there's a trauma energy, which
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:06.720]   I think is just fantastic. So it's been a long time waiting. I know there's a lot of people
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:12.880]   been asking about it. So here you go, everybody. We've got the new product, or Phillip's got the
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:19.200]   new product, Trump, easy, available October 10th. And definitely just give me, you know, want to give
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:24.480]   it a try. So now if you want to learn anything more about what we're doing, you can reach Philip
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:29.040]   here at Laila Quantum Tech or Quantum Upgrade, you can reach me at Tinkers Academy. All the links
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:34.080]   will be in the video description below. And again, of course, we all have Philip has two different
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:38.720]   telegram groups. I've got two different groups. So lots of different ways to reach us to ask
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:45.120]   questions about about Trump easy and and leave us your comments. So really appreciate everyone's
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:50.000]   watching this video and really excited. So, you know, go ahead, give it a try, everybody,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.400]   and let us know what what happens and how it helps you. So Philip, any parting words?
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:44:01.280]   Yeah. So first of all, this also has been tested and certified by the Bayes Institute.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:05.680]   And we just don't have it up on the website. Maybe it'll be with be there by the 10th. But if not,
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:12.320]   then a little later, because they're still it's it's still in in processing and and translation,
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:17.680]   basically the certificate. But it is already certified. Wow, it's important to say it. And then
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:22.880]   other than that, yeah, I think really what what you just mentioned, you know, let us know, you know,
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:27.600]   in the telegram groups, how you feel with it, and you know, what what it has done for you once you
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:32.240]   tried it. And obviously, if you have any questions, any other questions, let us know.
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:38.080]   Okay. Well, thank you so much for your time today, Philip. This is exciting, a new service.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:41.600]   That sounds like it's going to really help a lot of people. So I personally am looking
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:46.240]   forward to trying it myself. So thank you very much for your time this morning and have a great day.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.320]   Thank you, you too. Aloha.
