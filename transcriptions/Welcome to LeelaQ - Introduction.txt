[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   Alala everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and this video
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.640]   is the first installment in a new video series I'm creating called Welcome to Layla Q.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.280]   And what I'm trying to do is create a bunch of different little videos that are answered the most
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.960]   common and frequently asked questions and telegram from new and old customers alike so that you can
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.080]   kind of have all this information just at your fingertips whenever you need it. Okay, so this is
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:33.040]   for this is the introduction video for anyone who's new to Layla quantum tech who wants to know
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.400]   you know where do I find information and how do I get help. All right, so here we go. So the first
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.800]   thing I want to kind of clarify one thing is that the idea behind Layla Q is that there's three basic
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.320]   things that are being offered on the market. One of them is actual quantum devices which are physical
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.920]   devices that you would buy like a water bottle or a capsule, you know, those kinds of blocks and
[00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.720]   things like that that you actually want to have a device at home that you can play with. Okay,
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.120]   and then there's another one called the quantum upgrade which is a quantum service that sends
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.800]   quantum energy to you, your phone, your car, your home, you know, that sort of thing. And so that
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.600]   you don't have to necessarily have a physical device to experience the benefits of quantum energy,
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.240]   but you can actually have it just sent to you through a subscription. And the third one is an
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.360]   actual service called trom EZ, which is a whole separate service. It's a third service. And that's
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.920]   for people that are interested in trying to work on trauma and try to release that and, you know,
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.080]   do that kind of trauma work. So let me kind of walk you through the three. Now these are, this is
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.800]   just an overview. There'll be a separate video on how to decide what, you know, what's best for
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.520]   you. But this, you know, this is the overview. Now this is Layla quantum tech's website. This is
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.800]   the device site. So anything you want to know about devices, you know, all the different things
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.040]   you could buy that physical things you could buy, you're going to find it here on this site. And of
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.600]   course, this is where you would purchase them. This is the quantum upgrade website. Same thing
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.480]   for the service that I just described. And of course, you've got the trom EZ harmonizer.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.760]   And that's the third service. So just keep in mind that when anyone refers to or when I specifically
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.120]   refer to Layla Q, I'm talking about all three of these wonderful, you know, services and products.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.240]   Okay. Now the next thing that you are probably most likely going to run into, you know, if you
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.640]   have a question. So the way that you would want to reach customer support is through the website
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.840]   or via email, you can email them directly, or you can use telegram. So let's walk you through that.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.120]   So this right here, again, is the Layla quantum tech website. And if you want to reach one of
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.800]   the customer support people, you go ahead and you click on about us, you click on contact,
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.640]   and you're going to get prompted with a form you can fill out, which will send them a little form
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.200]   into their email box. Or if you just want to email them directly through your Gmail or whatever,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.320]   here's the email address right here for Layla quantum tech. Now this is for the devices.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.960]   Now, if you've got the service and you've got a question, same thing, click on about us here.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.520]   You can click on contact right there, and you're going to get prompted with the same form you can
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.840]   fill out. Or you can just email them directly. Now it's a different email address because there's
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.560]   different teams that support the service versus the devices. Okay, now the one thing
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.040]   about trauma easy, I do want to point out is that it doesn't have a contact form or a contact email.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.640]   And if you had questions about trauma easy, you would get ahold of them through the telegram app.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.920]   Now, let's talk about the telegram. A lot of the interaction between customers and Layla quantum
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.480]   tech is done through telegram. It's a direct messaging, you know, one of those, you know,
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.000]   social media app applications that's primarily for messaging. Now there's different groups that are
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.560]   set up on telegram for customer support. And the three groups on telegram are and this is for the
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.320]   English speaking market is for is the quantum power group. That's the devices. Then there's the
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.760]   quantum upgrade community and that's for the service. And then there's a trauma easy community.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.600]   And that's for trauma easy. Now, if you are the in the German market, what Layla has done is they've
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.280]   combined all three into one telegram group called the quantum power group. And that's in the German
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.480]   language. Okay, so there's English one. That's just one, you know, general telegram group for the
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.440]   English folks. I'm sorry, the German folks. And then there's three separate ones for the English
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.200]   speaking folks. And that's basically how you know which group to go into. So let's say you had a
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.880]   question about one of your devices. And so you would want if you want to do just reach out in
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.680]   telegram, you know, you have three different choices. All you need to do is you go into telegram and
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.320]   you just type in your question. So let's say I got a question, I just type in my question.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.600]   Here's my question. And then the main thing that's important is you want to basically tag.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.200]   And in telegram tagging means that you're going to alert the person you want to see that post. So
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.520]   what you want to do is you want to type in the asterisk symbol, right, you see the little asterisk
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.120]   symbol. And then you want to type in Leila. And once you see Leila, then right here is the Leila
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.520]   support, you know, person, the primary person, but everybody also, you know, that works there
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.160]   also works off of this one address. It's a username on telegram. And so you want to
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.440]   click on it. And that's our famous Emma person. And so if you see if you have a question and you
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.880]   want her to see it or you want the support people to see it, you make sure to ask your question
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.760]   and then type in at, you know, at Leila, and then go ahead and click on it. So let me do that again.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:36.720]   In case I was a little too fast for you, basically you want to type in asterisk Leila. And then there's
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.080]   this little list of options and you would just click on on the Leila support. And then all you
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.800]   got to do is click the little telegram icon. And there you got it right there. Now the next time
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.000]   she logs in, she's going to see this and then address your question. Okay. So that's how you do
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.360]   the just that's the first way you do it. Type your question and tag. Now I want to go ahead
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.040]   and delete that so Emma doesn't get confused. The other way to do to reach out is to go direct
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.920]   direct message. So if you wanted to direct message anyone that's, you know, the Leila support folks,
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.320]   then you want to go ahead and go into your search. Sorry, a little too fast. You want to go ahead on
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.680]   on your main menu, click the search icon, you click on that, you type in Leila again, right?
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.120]   Leila. And you're going to see right here, you're going to see, uh, Emma, basically the Leila
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.440]   quantum tech support. So you're going to go ahead and click on that. And here's this, I have this
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.160]   ongoing chat. I'm always chatting with her. And then you would just go ahead and just DM her directly.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.480]   That's direct message Emma and say, Hey, I got a question. You know, and then you just type in your
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.600]   post and then go ahead and then post a question directly to her. And then she will get it directly
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.120]   outside of the group. So if you don't want anyone to read your question, then go ahead and direct
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.720]   message her using the feature I just showed you. And that's how you reach those guys. Okay. Now,
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.200]   the other thing you want to know about is resources. So if you're the kind of person you just have a
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.240]   quick question, or you just want to go look up some stuff, you want some information, not necessarily
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.280]   support, you know, you just want to learn something or you want to get an answer to a general question,
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.000]   and you don't want to bother anybody yet support, which is totally fine. There's different resources
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.880]   that you have at your disposal that I want to, you know, kind of share with you. The first one
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:29.360]   is is, and I see this often is when someone is completely brand new to quantum energy, and they
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.400]   just want to understand like, what is quantum upgrade or what is quantum energy? How does it
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.480]   work? That kind of thing. Well, one of the things you could do is you go on to the website. Now,
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.520]   if you go on to any on to any one of the websites, specifically the two, which is quantum upgrade,
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.320]   or you go on to lay the quantum tech. Now, if you go on to these websites, you're going to see a
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.920]   section here called media. You'll see that on both sides. Well, it's called press on quantum
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:08:01.440]   upgrade, but it's called media over here on quantum on the quantum tech website. Okay, you click on
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:08.640]   media. And this is probably the most informative, you know, section of what you if you wanted to
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:13.760]   just learn in general terms what it's all about. Now, the founder and owner of Layla quantum tech,
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.720]   his name is Philip Von Holzenthaler. That's him. That's my buddy. And so what they do is that he
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:25.360]   goes on podcasts and interviews, and he gives lectures, literally every other week. I mean,
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.160]   the guy is all over the internet. And so they list here the most important ones, the ones I've
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.520]   got the most amount of information where you can go and click on any one of these and listen to his,
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.200]   you know, listening to him have a discussion with Dave Asprey, you know, by hacking with Brittany.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.280]   I mean, he's just a wellness mama. You name it. You know, so there's all these different
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:51.520]   individuals, you know, you name it Ben Greenfield and Luke Story on all of these different podcasts.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.160]   Phillips has appeared on these multiple different shows, and he's even been on television
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.800]   in Germany. So all of those podcasts and interviews are all right here under media.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.880]   So if you are just really new to this, and you just want to kind of understand it better,
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.880]   maybe you've heard one, maybe it might help you to learn, you know, to hear another one,
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.880]   you can go ahead into the media section, and you can listen to some of those interviews and kind
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.200]   of really get a good overview because, you know, those interviewers are asking a ton of questions.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.440]   Now, obviously, if you just want information, you can obviously, you know, the websites are there
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.280]   for you. So one of the things about the website, and this is real important for just people who
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.240]   want information, is that there's two areas here that I use, and one of them is called research.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.120]   Now, if you are interested and you want to know, hey, what are, you know, what's the research
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.560]   behind this? What is the third party studies? Now, all of these studies have done have been done
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:46.960]   by third parties or independent third parties, whether they're universities or institutions,
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:53.120]   or just specific, you know, individuals out there like, you know, clinicians and scientists,
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:58.000]   individual, but there's all of these third party studies that have been commissioned by Leila
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.200]   Quantum Tech on the upgrade service on the devices. Okay, and so you can go to either one of the
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:09.520]   two sites. And if you want to see the studies about, you know, about quantum upgrade, you would go
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.600]   to the quantum upgrade site, click on research, and you're going to see studies that were done
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.880]   on quantum upgrade. And if you do the same here on the Leila Quantum Tech device site,
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.440]   you're going to find studies on just on the devices themselves. And so that's where you're going to
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.520]   go. And you know, for those of you who are really interested in like, you know, what does the science
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:33.840]   say about all this? Because one of the most amazing things about Leila Q is that they put a lot of
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:40.480]   their profits back into, you know, the science of it and commissioning study after study. There's no
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.680]   less than a dozen studies going on at any given time. And there's well over 60 that have been
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.200]   published to date. So there's a ton of science and a ton of money goes into making sure that
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.560]   what they claim is true, and that you can go ahead and look at the third party science behind it
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.560]   to see that it's true. Now I do want to point out that there hasn't been studies done on Trump
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.760]   easy. I'm not sure where that stands on the radar, but there's primarily all the studies have been
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:11.200]   done on devices and on quantum upgrade. And that's definitely someplace that, you know, you could go
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.240]   if you want to learn more about the science behind the claims that are being made. Now the
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:22.080]   other thing you could do for information about, you know, Leila quantum is that they've got a huge
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:28.240]   FAQ. So one of the things if you have information about FAQ, if you go on the Leila Q website, you
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.480]   look under how it works, and you go click on FAQ, and there is a chock full of FAQs that you can go
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.800]   ahead and it just goes on and on and on. Just like every other website, they've got a really
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:44.800]   very well informative FAQ section. Now if you've got a question about your quantum upgrade and you
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.640]   want to look at the FAQ for that, you click on about us, and then right here is the FAQs for quantum
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:58.320]   upgrade. Okay, now there is no FAQ for Trump easy, but there's a whole other section I'll show you
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.560]   on where you get more information about Trump easy. We've done quite a bit of work on trying to
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.920]   make sure that people have access to the information for that. So that's how you would do to get
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.600]   information off the website. Now there's also tutorials, no there's video tutorials are available
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.840]   to you. And so there's two main places where you're going to find video tutorials. One of them is on
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:26.160]   the quantum power channel on YouTube, and this is where the Leila team is putting up all of their
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.800]   videos. You would just go ahead and click on playlist here, and you would just pick whatever
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:35.440]   product group you have that you're interested in, and you would go ahead and click on that. So if
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.440]   I want to know, you know, if I have a quantum block and I've got some questions, here's the playlist
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.640]   of tutorials about the quantum block. Same thing with the frequency cards, you know, the infinity
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.440]   block, the water bottles, and so forth. Now the other section you could go to, the other site you
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:55.200]   could go to for tutorials is my own blog, which is the Tinkers Academy blog. I'm actually an
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.560]   independent third person. I don't work for Leila quantum tech. I'm just one of the super users,
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:06.240]   I ended up being an affiliate, and I work with them quite often. So on my Tinkers Academy blog,
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.640]   I've got a section called quantum energy right there. And if you click on quantum energy, I've
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:15.920]   combined and, you know, basically, you know, collect, you know, collected all of the information.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.520]   Anyone would ever be interested in about Leila quantum tech and quantum energy into one place.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.920]   So if you got questions about the quantum tech, you know, if there's tutorials for that now,
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.520]   we're, we are working on tutorials for quantum upgrade. Primarily, they're just, we've just
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:37.440]   primarily got tutorials on quantum tech, which is the devices. And if you want access to those,
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.680]   you just go ahead and click on Leila quantum tech. And it comes to here's my list of stuff
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.600]   that you want to know about. And you would just go click right here tutorials by me,
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.760]   K Elmer. And if you click on that, there's a list of all the tutorials that I've created
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:54.080]   with Philip are on my own on different quantum blocks, like how to use the quantum block. It's
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:59.840]   a four part series because there's so much information about the benefits of the block and all the
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.080]   stuff you can do with the blocks. And then, of course, I've added a whole series or three part
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:09.040]   series on my own on how to tinker with them and get the most out of your investment. So there's
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:14.000]   tutorials on capsules and cards and then there's tutorials on just general information. So again,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   if you want information on, you know, if you're the type of person that likes videos, then you
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.480]   definitely want to check out the tutorials on the Leila quantum tech YouTube channel or on my blog,
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.280]   you'll find a full list of of all the tutorials there. Now there's one other place that there is a
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:35.760]   ton of information and is that I created a Leila quantum tech quick reference guide. Now there's
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.440]   links to this, everything you're I'm covering, I'm showing you today, there'll be links in the
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:45.120]   video description. But there's actually a quick reference guide that I created. It's quite
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.440]   extensive. And it basically has all the product specifications that you would want. Because we
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.240]   get questions from everything from how big is the card exactly? Or what is a capsule way? What size
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.240]   is the military sphere that goes in there? And they're in how big's the field? I mean, you name
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.160]   if you got a question about the product, obviously, you can go to the website. But if you can't find
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.160]   the information on the website, then I've got a quick reference guide that's just chock full
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.400]   of all the information you would want about the product, about charging, how long it takes to
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.640]   charge different things, how to copy frequencies and the different timeframes based on what you're
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:20.320]   copying, how you know, information all about the quick quantum upgrade, the Leila queue frequencies
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.400]   and information about trauma easy. And this is where I was talking about earlier about, you know,
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.320]   where can you find more information about trauma easy? Well, here in the quick reference guide,
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:33.680]   there's definitely a section for trauma easy. And let me see if I can find this all the way on
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.960]   the bottom. And there's just some basic information here, but there's tutorials for trauma easy,
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.440]   okay? And so if you I'll show you that here. But basically, this is where you would go for all
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:49.680]   the trauma easy stuff. And also in the quick reference guide are links to two separate documents
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.400]   that are going to list out the descriptions for all of the frequencies available in that,
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:59.040]   you know, you know, in that area. So if you're if you've got devices, which means that you've got a
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.640]   Leila quantum tech card, and then all the frequencies available on the cards are going to be in this
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.960]   link right here on some page 14. Or if you've got quantum upgrading, you know, why don't you
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.040]   want to understand what all of the different frequencies are, are there, you've got this link
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.160]   right here? And it just pops up another video, I'm sorry, another document that lists all of the
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.880]   different frequencies under each different bundle on quantum upgrade. Okay, so that's how we would
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:28.960]   use that. So now going back to quantum, sorry, the trauma easy, I want to just make sure I point
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:35.840]   out that everybody should know, if you go back to my blog, and you go to the quantum energy section
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:42.160]   here, I basically have a Leila quantum tech section, a quantum upgrade section, and I got a trauma easy
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.800]   section. So if you go to my trauma easy section on my blog, that's where you're going to get the
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:53.920]   video tutorials for trauma easy. Okay, so here you go, you got this, you got the website here,
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.920]   and then you've got the different looks like I need to upgrade the update this link, but you've
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:03.920]   got the how to subscribe to trauma easy, how to use it, how to use the different features within it,
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.480]   and then you've got the Q and A's that Philip and I have done on trauma easy. So we've done five to
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:14.560]   six different videos now on trauma easy. And it's just there's a bunch of information for trauma easy
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.280]   available on this playlist, which is also on my YouTube channel. But you know, I try to keep
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:25.120]   everything categorized, fairly organized here on my blog, so you can go ahead and find all of these
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.920]   things too. Oh, and I kind of just wanted to mention this too. I forgot to mention this. There's also
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:36.000]   another set of videos and a playlist called the benefits of quantum healing. So if you're interested
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.760]   in that research that I was mentioning a little early early, you know, the science behind it,
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.320]   well, what I've done over the time is I've made separate videos that kind of summarize so that
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.600]   you don't have to read a 30 or 60 page study. If that's not your thing, but I do little video
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:55.200]   summaries of the different studies and also anecdotal information coming from the telegram users.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.200]   And so basically, if they put out a study like most recently, they put out a study on
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.920]   food intolerances. And so I did a video on that. And basically, it just kind of just would you just
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:10.480]   click on this puppy, any one of these, and it's going to pop up the YouTube, YouTube commercial,
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.200]   but it's going to pop up all the different things that, you know, the studies have shown or what
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:21.520]   we've learned from testimonies, everything on people dealing with allergies, you know, autism,
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:26.960]   EMF, EMF in electric cars, pets, plants, plants is a real important one too, you know, for those of
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:32.880]   you guys are into growing stuff, you know, the effects on sleep and wound healing and even the
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:38.160]   VACs, right? So you can also get a lot of information right there on the video series benefits of
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.480]   quantum healing. And again, you just really kind of want to go to the quantum energy section
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.840]   of my blog, and you can get a ton of video information for from a resource perspective.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.600]   Now I've also talked about the reference guide. And then the last place you can go
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.560]   obviously is going to be telegram. So let's talk about telegram for a second, because there's a
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.920]   ton of information on telegram. So I want to kind of share with you some telegram tips and tricks
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:06.560]   on using telegram to find out more about quantum energy and any one of the products, any one of
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.280]   the services and so forth. So let me go ahead and pull that puppy back up again. So now if you
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:17.120]   have telegram or you want to engage with other customers, this is where you would go. So now
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:22.240]   there's great videos, there's just tons of videos on YouTube on how to use telegram. So just go ahead
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.720]   and check out any one of those, and I'll show you how to sign up and all that stuff. But if you're
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:33.040]   specific to lay like you, now if you wanted to use the telegram and you wanted to use the telegram
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.520]   to kind of find out more information, this is what you would do. So you basically you would go
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.560]   into one of these groups. And so if you're English speaking, you want to go and if you have a block
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:49.040]   or device or so forth, and you want to find out some information. The first thing that you know I
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:55.520]   would do is just go into the this is your quantum power group English speaking group for devices.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:00.400]   And I would go ahead and just click right here on the three circles and just click search. And then
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.280]   what I can do is I can type in anything. So let's say I'm interested in, you know, I've got a question
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:11.360]   about sleep. Okay, like, you know, I just would type in the keyword sleep. And then I would go
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.520]   ahead and click enter. And right here on the bottom, you're going to see right here, it says,
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:23.200]   this is number one instance of the word sleep in this chat group out of 1867 times that the word
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:28.240]   sleep's been put in there. And you know, there's a lot. I mean, there's there's over 80,000 posts
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:33.200]   the chat group goes back years. So there's a lot. So it's one of the more difficult ways to find
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:39.120]   information. If you have a generic keyword, but if you have a very specific keyword, then you're
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.560]   probably going to find a lot more information. But bottom line is you would just type in the word,
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.200]   the subject you're looking for. And then right here, you can go up and you just go
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.400]   message by message by message looking for information that has mentioned the word sleep. So if you
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:58.240]   have a very specific one, it totally works a lot better. You're using search, then if you just had
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.320]   a generic one, I just you know, that's just, you know, that's just how it works, right? But you can
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:08.240]   definitely use search. Now the other way you could use the telegram group, obviously, is just posting
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:13.760]   your question in there. And there's just a whole bunch of folks, myself included, that will jump in
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:19.360]   and help you understand your whatever you're asking about or give you the information you're
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.480]   looking for. So you can definitely go ahead and just post. So you can search, you can post. And
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:29.040]   then the other thing you could do, and this is something I really want to make sure I mentioned,
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.680]   because not a lot of new people to telegram realize it. But if you go ahead and click on
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:39.120]   the title bar of the group, and this is on any telegram group, you tick click on the title bar,
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:45.120]   and it's going to pop up this menu here. And right here is where all the information's been kind of,
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:50.880]   you know, organized for you automatically by telegram. So now if you just want to see like,
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:56.800]   what's the media, like what kind of photos and videos that people have posted, you know, this
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:04.480]   thing is got hundreds of really great videos and are not necessarily videos, but pictures of stuff
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:10.320]   that people have been doing, you know, with their quantum devices. And so, you know, so basically,
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:14.640]   you want to get some ideas on what people have been doing, like, like this character here, that's
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:20.160]   my dog, you charged my dog. And you know, and then there's other people that, you know, like had a
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:25.360]   dog back was hurt and they had a capsule, and they put it on their dog. There's other videos in
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.320]   here. There's like little short clips of videos from Philip. There's pictures, another one from me
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:35.520]   again. You know, this one, I'm helping a dog and kind of talking about it. But then you can also
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.600]   see, you know, like, what are people doing in terms of like, what else are they charging? What
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.720]   else are they doing? How are they set up their, you know, their quantum blocks? Like, you know,
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.800]   like, here's one here where people can someone posted this, you know, kind of showing this is how
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:53.360]   they have it set up if they want to lay in between the plates and charge themselves and that sort of
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:59.680]   thing. So there's just just tons and tons of little videos and tons of pictures in the media
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.480]   section for all those kinds of things that you want to get an idea on what to, on how to use
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:10.080]   your device. Then there you go. Now, the other thing too, of course, there's saved. There's saved
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.360]   messages that, you know, that are just, you know, it's just something that the administrators want
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.920]   to save the message. So you can see what the important ones they are that they want you to see,
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:24.400]   which are also in the pinned messages, all the different files that have been loaded. So like,
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.240]   if you want the quick reference guide, here it is. Boom, right there, the quick reference guide,
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:33.040]   version 1.2, that's goes to that guide. So you click on files and you can go right to that,
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.840]   that reference guide and it's going to load right up for you. Okay, just like that right
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.320]   inside Telegram effect. Okay, now, of course, there's links. So you want to see all the different links
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.720]   that have been posted, all the videos and you name it, you're going to see all the different links. So
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.200]   that's a really great feature of Telegram. It's got all of these different little options here,
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:56.400]   media, save files, links, and so forth that you can go ahead and access just by clicking on the title
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:01.440]   bar. So that's one place, one more place you could find information. So you could search,
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.480]   you could ask, you can go into the media, you can look up files and links and media. And then the
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.040]   last thing I kind of want to share with all of you folks, especially, you know, for anyone who's
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.680]   interested in the other group. So if you're in the German group, and you're interested in the
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.680]   American group, or you're in the American group, or not necessarily American group, but the English
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.920]   speaking group, and interested in the German group, one of the things you could do here. So if I
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.400]   click on the German group, okay, and I just want to just check out like they're really busy today,
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.320]   there's, you know, all these different questions, there's this conversation going on right now.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.960]   Obviously said German, I'm English speaking, and, you know, and I can't read it, right,
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.520]   because it's in a different language, but there's a way. So what I want to point out is how do you
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:46.800]   easily translate if you want to just check out the other group? And so the easiest way to do it,
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.000]   and I want to show you how, is right here, you see these three bars on your main menu on Telegram,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.560]   you would want to go ahead and click on those three bars, you're going to pull yourself up,
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.400]   you're going to go into settings, and then you scroll down
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:08.080]   to language, you click on language, and then you see this right here, it says show translate button,
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:15.200]   you turn that guy on, and it's going to show translate when you right click. Go back out,
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.200]   and I go back into the German group, or if you're a German, you know, you can just,
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.720]   you can set whatever language you want it to translate into. It'll auto detect the language,
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.760]   and then translate it into the language of your choice. So I go back into the German group,
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.800]   and I click on the message you see right here, there's now a translate feature, you know,
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:40.480]   you can do a translate. So you click on translate, and guess what, Telegram automatically translates
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.680]   the message for you, so you can kind of read what they're talking about, you know, or, you know,
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.640]   or you can read an answer to your question, whatever, but you can see right here,
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.440]   where it automatically translated that post that was written in German into English, so I could
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.760]   read it, and so that's kind of handy. Now there's another feature in Telegram, I do want to mention
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.960]   that if you wanted to just have the whole thing automatically translate for you, without you having
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.480]   to click anything, there's a Telegram Pro for $4.99 a month, I'm not pitching Telegram,
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.920]   but if you pay them $4.99 a month, you can get a translate channel feature, where you can just
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.080]   click on a translate the whole channel, and it'll completely turn the thing into whatever language
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.720]   you want to read it, so you don't have to do one at a time, but the free one is one, one post at a
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.440]   time, and there you go, that's how you do translate, pretty cool, so anyway, I just want to say, hey,
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:33.760]   thanks a lot for watching the video, I hope this was helpful, welcome to Lele Q, here's all of the
