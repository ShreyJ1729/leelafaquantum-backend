[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   Aloha, everyone, and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host,
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.760]   Kay Elmer, and in this video, I'd like to talk to you about why you need vitamin D.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.480]   No, really, because I know you've watched lots of different vitamin videos, and of course,
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.160]   you know that every vitamin is important to you and all the minerals and all that stuff,
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.720]   but this is not that video. Basically, what I wanted to share with you is some news
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.880]   that's coming up, some studies that have been done about the effect of vitamin D on the news,
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.640]   and also, you know, really kind of just taking a look at some of the myths, like, you know,
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.680]   what's the deal with vitamin D and vitamin K, and do you really need both? Is sunlight better than
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.320]   oral, you know, oral supplementation and that sort of thing? So, I did some research, wanted to share
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.000]   it with you, especially in light of the times, and, you know, want you to join me, and maybe I can
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.800]   help you learn something, and this will be educational for you, and so let's jump right in. So, of course,
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.120]   there's that disclaimer, the video content is not intended for to be a substitute for professional

[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.120]   sue me. Bottom line, though, is, you know, if you just find stuff on the internet and YouTube and
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.440]   things like that, you know, I encourage everyone to do their own research. I try to provide as much
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.680]   research to you and help you make the right decisions for you and your family. Also, too,
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.920]   another just FYI, all of the information held in this video is available via links in the video
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.960]   description below, including products, research, etc, etc. So there you go. Let's jump right in.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.880]   Now, first things first, I'm just going to real quick, you can just, you know, pause the video if
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.400]   you want to read the slide. But bottom line is depending on what you read, the vitamin D deficiency
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.200]   in the general population for Caucasians is anywhere from 36 to 42%. So there are a butt load of us
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.920]   that are vitamin D deficient and most likely deficient and everything else as well. So that's
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.840]   no surprise, right? But the thing that's interesting that when I did the research on this was that
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.080]   Hispanics are 63% on, you know, on average when they do these statistical analyses and even more
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.160]   so African Americans are 82% deficient in vitamin D. So it's kind of a pronounced problem. You know,
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.240]   you can definitely see and it's even more interesting as the darker your skin is that you'd actually
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.920]   have more problems with vitamin D. So I thought that was really interesting and obviously there's
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.640]   a lot of associated problems with vitamin D and you can go ahead and just take a peek at this thing.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.520]   But one of the interesting things here is that there are a lot of things that can go wrong if you
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.600]   don't have enough vitamin D, which of course goes along with everything else that you could be
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.680]   deficient in. So bottom line vitamin D deficiency bad. Okay, but here's the news that I wanted to
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.560]   share with you. And this is the thing you, unless you're living under a rock, and most of you are
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.600]   not bottom line is, you know, yours, if you've been paying attention to the news, then you know
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.120]   that this is coming up and it's becoming more and more and more pronounced in media and the mainstream
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.960]   media about the fact that, you know, COVID is making a comeback. So let me just share with you.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.760]   This is from the Today NBC News. Literally one week ago today, today is September 12th,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.640]   Tuesday, 2023. And now, honestly, everywhere I look, YouTube, you know, I don't really watch
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.360]   television, but all the ads that I'm seeing on all the different streaming services that I have
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.280]   are now really, really pumping, you know, the fact that COVID's making a rise. And of course,
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.280]   they just recently just FDA just approved a new booster. So, you know, it's, it's like,
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.000]   it's really, really ramping up. And so I just wanted to share it with you. She kind of get an
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.240]   idea of what's really going on concert and sports arenas, even daytime TV. A reminder that COVID-19
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.720]   has not gone away as health experts say a late summer wave of cases is now leading to an uptick
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.960]   in hospitalizations, though still well below pandemic peaks.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.120]   We haven't reached a predictable pattern with the virus. That's why we have to care. And we're
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.800]   seeing incredible mutations and changes in the virus among those. Boy, where have you heard that
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.240]   before? So, you know, at the end of the day, when we take a look at what happened during the pandemic,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.040]   I think it's safe to say that people were getting sick. You know, we know that the PCR tests were
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.480]   flawed. So you're either getting a cold, the flu, you know, or COVID itself. But there really was an
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.200]   actual COVID because of all the people I know and all the different, I mean, I really just, you know,
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.400]   what do we do for two years other than being locked down and just really pay attention to this stuff.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.720]   But at the end of the day, people are getting sick. And so the people who actually got COVID were
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.640]   just sick as hell, couldn't smell just out for two weeks down. I mean, down hard. And then a lot
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.800]   of them have long COVID where they're still not well. And then there's other people out there who
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.200]   just got the flu. And you know, I knew people that, you know, basically tested positive and got a
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   two week vacation with a little bit of sniffles. So, you know, the whole idea though, is that there's
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.680]   a regular flu that goes around even as much as the media wants to pretend that the flu went away
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.400]   during pandemic, which is complete BS, right? The flu just doesn't disappear after 200 years.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.440]   So bottom line though, but you know, let's just for sake of argument, people are getting sick and
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.520]   you're either getting really, really sick or mildly sick. But either way, you're getting sick. And
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.920]   now with this thing coming back, you know, and they're really starting to pump it out,
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:44.160]   then obviously we're also entering into winter. So here's the thing that I wanted to point out
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.800]   specifically to COVID because you know, they're making a big deal about it coming back. And as
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.200]   course, you remember it being something that was a bioweapon that got out of a lab or released from
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.000]   a lab, depends on who you talk to. But at the end of the day though, you know, if this is coming back
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.960]   and we're going to see another, you know, release and or seasonal flu and all that stuff, then this
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.360]   is what really is interesting about that particular thing. So, and the thing that we're really most
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.120]   concerned about and what I'm kind of keeping an eye on is, hey, you know, if something else gets
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.600]   released again, and they want to ramp it up because, you know, coincidentally, it is an election year
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.360]   next year. Bottom line is that, you know, in the early days of the pandemic, they did a study and
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.240]   there's a study published in the NCBI, you know, you know, scientific literature that basically
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.000]   we're saying, hey, you know, they took a look in the early days of the of the pandemic. They were
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.320]   looking at, okay, let's again, let's just ignore that whole PCR thing being wrong and who knows
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.360]   what they really had. But at the end of the day, they basically said, hey, you know, 180 out of 185
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.360]   people that were hospitalized, being sick with the, you know, the typical symptoms of flu/COVID
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.240]   bottom line, though, they took a look at that and they found out that out of 185 people,
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:02.480]   they're showed statistically a clear inverse relationship between the magnitude of the disease
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:09.440]   and the levels of vitamin D on admission. Okay, so out of these, the 50% who were hospitalized,
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.280]   okay, showed characteristic, characteristic vitamin D deficiency. Now, okay, so let's
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.440]   say 185 people get sick, you know, and end up in the hospital because they're sick.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.760]   And then we know that 36 to 42% are vitamin D deficient anyway. And they find out that 50%
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.000]   of the people that ended up in the hospital are vitamin D deficient. Well, you know, honestly,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.720]   unless they split that out by race, that just means that it's just the typical population. All
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.160]   right. Right. I mean, statistically, it's the same time number almost. So it really did vitamin D
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.480]   really make a difference between the severity of the disease. By the way, we're not talking about
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.600]   getting it or not. We're talking about severity. Okay, this is what the study focused on. So the
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.200]   whole idea, though, is that, you know, the scientists were like, you know, is it really causation
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.720]   or preventative? And the numbers really weren't there. And so the whole idea there,
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.400]   they were looking at in the beginning, they were looking at science was looking at the ability for
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.840]   vitamin D to counteract, you know, you know, the actual catching of the disease. And they were
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.160]   looking at it as a possible treatment. So then what was interesting, though, and I want to point
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.800]   out another study that was published in PubMed called vitamin D insufficiency may account for
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:23.280]   almost nine of 10 COVID-19 deaths. Okay, so this was later on in the year in 2020, where they
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.280]   started looking at people who were, you know, they were claiming that died of COVID. And again,
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.600]   if you've been paying attention during the pandemic, you know, that's, there's a lot of BS in those
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.360]   numbers. And so it looks like it's really hard to kind of make sense of it. But if you just step
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.880]   back and say, okay, regardless of what the PCR test, who cares what you labeled their illness,
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:48.640]   let's just say they got sick. And they ended up in the hospital, and no real change there,
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:53.600]   you know, the same kind of rough percentages. Unless, of course, like again, unless you really
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.080]   break it out by race, you really don't know if that 50%, you know, we're vitamin D deficient,
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.000]   because they, you know, was it because they were sick? Who knows, right? Because it just, it isn't
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.120]   substantial. However, they later on did another study and was a study of studies, you know,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.480]   where they actually said, Hey, let's look at all the people that are claimed to have died,
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:18.240]   you know, or died with a claim, right, to COVID. And again, just people that are sick,
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.880]   people that are sick and died that year. When they took a look at it, I think this is where it
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.400]   really stands out as as a causation. And basically, they said, you know, of this study, where they
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.520]   found out that almost nine out of 10 people died. So bottom line, those evidence from observational
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.720]   studies and accumulating is accumulating, right? This was during the pandemic, there were a year
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.720]   into it. But bottom line, they really started taking a look at the studies and that they've
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:48.400]   discovered that the majority of deaths due to SARS COVID infections, i.e. they were sick,
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:54.320]   were statistically attributed attributable to vitamin D insufficiency and could potentially
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.280]   be prevented by vitamin D supplementation. So at this point, a year into the pandemic, you know,
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.440]   doctors, parents, scientists, and all those guys started realizing that, Hey, vitamin D is playing
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.080]   a significant role, not only in the severity of the conditions, but also now is really affecting
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.800]   the deaths of people who, quote, got sick of something, right? But then this is what's most
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.200]   important. This is really what I wanted to convey. One of the key points in this video is that,
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.640]   hey, this study available PubMed links below in the video description, you can read the study yourself.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:28.880]   Bottom line is that when translated to the proportional proportion of deaths in the population
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.240]   that is statistically attributable to vitamin D insufficiency, a key measure of public health
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:43.920]   relevance of risk factors, these results imply that 87% of people who got sick died deaths, right?
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.960]   Maybe statistically attributed to vitamin D insufficiency and could potentially be avoided by
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:57.920]   eliminating vitamin D insufficiency. Okay, so what does that mean? Seriously, getting sick,
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:02.720]   whether it's the flu or whatever they want to name it this year, right? Bottom line is, hey,
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:10.080]   you know what? The majority, the majority, nine out of 10 people who ended up dying from being sick,
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.520]   right? Call it which one? We're vitamin D deficient. I think that is a significant
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:21.280]   piece of information. Take that bullet, put it in a pin, and then say, hey, well, wait a minute,
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.480]   then okay, it does actually make an effect. I mean, these are, it has an effect. Okay, so now,
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.040]   that's what I really wanted to convey. So when it comes to why do you need vitamin D, well, hey,
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.160]   this is a hell of a reason. We're getting into winter now. It's, it's fall. We're in the flu season,
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.400]   and now we're going to be coming up to COVID season. And I realize that a lot of you still have
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.040]   your wildfire decorations up, but now we need to put up our COVID decorations. But here we go.
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:50.800]   We're entering a new season and vitamin D is a big deal with it according to the studies of the
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.080]   studies. Okay, so this is real factual information, not the propaganda, you know, that other stuff.
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.360]   So now, let's take a look at some of the myths behind vitamin D. So hey, you know, one of the
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:06.400]   first questions I want to know was, well, you know, I mean, I take supplementation for vitamin D,
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.280]   and I'm also, you know, I also try to spend as much time as I can outdoors getting sunlight.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:17.520]   The two ways you can get vitamin D is your body can produce it when you're out in the sun, right,
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.280]   or you can take its supplements. But one of the questions that I came up with is like, well,
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.000]   which is better. You know, I mean, is there really any difference between getting sunlight and
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.840]   taking oral supplementation? And then of course, you know, you got this whole thing in the winter,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.640]   where you're not really going to get a lot of sunlight because you're wearing so much clothes.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.360]   And at the same time, we have a society now that is sort of wrapped around their smart devices,
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.640]   and they don't get any sun normally, you know, so there's not a lot of people that work outside,
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.720]   you know, you know, actually, you know, because we're service industry, we're typically working
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:53.840]   indoors, the majority of us. So hey, which one's better taking a supplement or going to getting
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:59.360]   sunlight? And here's an interesting study that came from the NCBI. The title of this study is
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.960]   effective sun exposure versus oral vitamin D supplementation on, you know, vitamin D3 levels
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.280]   in young adults. I'm sorry, young adults. And so the interesting thing about this study was they've
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.160]   discovered that there's really no difference. Okay, so that means that both are good. And so
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.480]   they took it, there was an eight week randomized placebo controlled clinical trial that they did
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:24.480]   in Korea, which is they didn't soul Korea. And now so Korea is at 37 North Latitudes. So you know,
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.040]   it's the same point. Literally, you know, I think I think the United States, the continental United
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:36.240]   States is the lower 48, right? So it's anywhere from like 30 degrees North Latitude to 48 degrees
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.200]   North Latitude. So if your soul would be like literally the middle of our country in terms of
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.320]   where it is on the planet. So it's the same place, same amount of sunlight, eight week controlled
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.120]   randomized study, and they did a study. And they discovered, and this is what's interesting though,
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:56.960]   they discovered that sun exposure and oral vitamin D three effectively increased. So that was bottom
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.120]   line, the bottom line is that, hey, there's really no difference between the two. However,
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.800]   what was interesting in the results of this study was they discovered that the ones that had taken
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   oral supplementation actually had higher vitamin D, but then when they actually got into the details
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.960]   of the people who were participating in this study, they found out that compliance with sun
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.200]   exposure was relatively low. In other words, the people who were told to go get extra amount of
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.320]   sunlight just didn't get around to doing it. And that's when they discovered, oh, that's why it's
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.720]   lower. So at the end of the day, the study comes out and says, Hey, you know what, they're pretty
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:37.600]   much the same. So you can, so the answer to this problem is bottom line is you can either take
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.440]   oral supplements or get sunlight, or both, right? If you really want to, I really want to make sure
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.040]   that you're out your levels are high. So now one of the things, so let's take a look at oral
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.400]   supplementation. So the issue about oral supplementation is that there's always been this thing about,
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.840]   you know, when you talk to the people that know this stuff, and they say, Oh, you have to take
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:00.000]   vitamin K, you know, especially, and just another thing too, there's vitamin D, there's vitamin K,
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:06.000]   and the ones that's recommended in these studies is a particular form of vitamin D called D3,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.880]   and a particular form of vitamin K called K2, right? So let's stick to D3K2 from this point forward.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.560]   So here's what's interesting. And I went looking around the internet for try to information about,
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.840]   Hey, you know, what's the relationship between the two? And there's lots of really good studies
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:25.680]   about it. And it really kind of summarizes down to the reason that those two are always kind of
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:31.120]   bundled together, and that you can't just think about, I need to take vitamin D or, you know, D3,
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.200]   I need to be taking K. And so why is that? So really, it's kind of very, very simple,
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:41.520]   is that here's the deal. In the absence of vitamin K2, calcium circulating in the body
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:48.480]   that has been absorbed from food by vitamin D is also deposited in the soft tissues of the body,
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:55.200]   and in the arteries leading to arterial sclerosis. Okay, so vitamin D3 should therefore always be
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.320]   taken in combination with vitamin K2. So what does that mean? Well, it's interesting because
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.520]   vitamin D and K, these are all like, you know, they're basically hormones, right? And so they
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:12.240]   basically trigger your body. And it has a lot to do with calcium. So what vitamin D does, and it's
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:20.160]   one of its one of its things that it does, right? Is it it deposits the calcium you're taking,
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.760]   and it puts into your soft tissues and your arteries. Now that's fine. If you don't overdo it,
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.360]   you know, your body will regulate itself. However, if you end up taking too much,
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:35.840]   or it accumulates too much in you, then that's problematic because you don't want to calcify your
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.880]   arteries. Clear, you know, that's common sense. And so what K2 does the opposite. And that's what
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:46.160]   K2 vitamin K comes in and says, Oh, no, it takes the vitamin, it takes the calcium out of your
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.560]   soft tissues and puts it into your bones. And that's why those two come together. They balance each
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.880]   other out so that over, you know, overdoing on either one or, you know, one or, you know,
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.120]   just keeping it all in balance so that you don't have too much calcium in your soft tissues and it
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.360]   always ends up where it needs to end up. And so that's really what it comes down to. So I found
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:09.040]   this really great article on a website called vitamin express. And in here, you know, when it
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.840]   talks about dosage, it's real interesting because that's one of the clear things I was trying to
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.240]   really trying to figure out in my research was what is the proper dosage of these two things,
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.240]   you know, A, it's clear you need to take it. You need, you know, you need this, right, if you
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.680]   especially if you want to avoid the big C. And so how much should you take? And so now the literature
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.040]   is a little bit, you know, literature is rule all over the map. And but bottom line is this
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.120]   article really kind of gets into the whole wall. If you have, if you know, this is your level of
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.280]   health, or if you have these health problems, and you should take this much, if not that much,
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.880]   if not, and so it really kind of broke it down to, Hey, what if there's a range, you know,
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:48.320]   so nothing's like, you know, black and white. So vitamin D three, people, this is the recommended
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.440]   dosage, you know, according to the science, based on your health, it really depends on your health.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.200]   You might want to take, you know, take a read at this article to kind of get an idea of like,
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:03.440]   where do you stand? But the range is anywhere from 2,500 to 5,000 IU per day for vitamin D three,
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:09.200]   and the range for vitamin K two is 45 to 200 micrograms per day. Okay, so that's really what
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.000]   people should be taking. And of course, now taking oral supplementation depends on how much sunlight
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.280]   you if you get all, if you get constant sunlight and you're always bodies producing it, as was,
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:24.000]   you know, as was the study in South Korea, you know, then you can completely be fine,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.080]   just off of sunlight. But if you don't get a lot of sunlight or no sunlight, then you're going to
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:32.000]   need oral, right? So it's kind of like this balance between the two, or you do the two together,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.320]   if you do the two together, then you don't have to worry about, you know, getting too much of either
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:42.240]   one. That's the whole point about the balancing. So I spent some time on Amazon, I did my thing,
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:48.720]   the best price, highest review, and also to try to figure out, okay, how do these numbers match up?
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:55.040]   So I did find two specific supplements that were the best price for their dosage amount
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.840]   per capsule. And the thing about it, right, this is the low end. So if this one from now,
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:06.400]   vitamins, basically the D3K2 complex, you know, it's really, it's really kind of really inexpensive,
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:14.240]   but it's 1000 IU and 45 MCG of vitamin K2. All right, so this would be the low end of the scale.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:19.520]   And then of course, the high end of the scale would be 5000 IU and 200 micrograms. And so you
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.960]   kind of got this is the scale right here. And this is the price difference, because you're obviously
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.440]   getting more. But you know, if you wanted to save some time, take a shortcut, then, you know,
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.760]   links in the video description below, I did the homework research for you. So that's kind of how
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:37.040]   that works out. And then of course, you know, again, guys, it's September, winter's coming,
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:42.480]   the ramping up COVID, you know, please, you know, just help yourself, help your loved ones,
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.840]   and make sure that you are covered. Okay, and that's my recommendation. And by the way,
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.760]   I do this as well. Now, talk about sunlight. Okay, so here's the thing about sunlight. And
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:59.920]   it's not about the actual like, you know, it's not the specific idea of the, you know, while it is
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:07.040]   bio photons coming from the sun, but it's specifically the UV radiation UVB and UVA radiation, that's
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.720]   actually driving the melanin production in your in your epidermal layer of your skin that produces
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:17.280]   the vitamin D. So, you know, for me, I was like, okay, well, if we know that which is better and
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:22.000]   they're both the same. And then okay, well, then during the winter, I definitely want to take
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.960]   supplementation, because I'm not getting as much sunlight. But also too, just what I do, and if
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:33.440]   I just wanted to kind of make this recommendation, is that I also continue to get sunlight quote
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:39.840]   and sunlight and quotes through the winter, I use a vitamin D lamp. And so, you know, here is a study
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:49.040]   from MCBI and CBI on the effect of ultraviolet radiation from a from a portable fluorescent lamp.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:54.320]   Okay. So, in other words, in the absence of sunlight, how do you keep getting, you know,
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.200]   how do you produce vitamin D naturally? Because for me, at the end of the day, I want to try to do
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:06.240]   everything I can as naturally as possible and not do, you know, not do synthetic, you know, synthetic
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.520]   simulation as much as I can. But bottom line, though, is this is why I think that it's really
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:18.880]   important to continue to get that ultraviolet radiation throughout the winter. So, you know,
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:25.120]   if you know, I'm from Hawaii, and so I never bothered with this. It was always sunny. And so,
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.640]   I didn't really think about it until I moved to the mainland. And when I got here, I'm like,
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.560]   you know what, I really want to make sure that I continue to get bio photons and, you know,
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:39.520]   sunlight throughout the winter months when I'm not being able to go outside very much or not
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.840]   be able to have sun exposure. So, I bought one of these lamps when I got here a couple of years ago,
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:48.480]   and I use it regularly throughout the winter. And I'll tell you, it really did, for me personally,
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.600]   this is my, you know, experiences. It really made, I think it made a positive difference in terms of
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:58.640]   just getting through the winter. You know, I was taking oral supplementation of vitamin DK2 as well
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:05.200]   as getting the, and getting the, you know, the UVB and UVA, you know, light to continue to have
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:12.480]   my body produce, you know, the melanin and producing D3. So, the interesting thing about this study,
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.680]   though, is that it proves that using this lamp, this very specific lamp, which was what was chosen
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:24.640]   to be used in the study, discovered that, you know, when you use this lamp, okay, it was, the study was,
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:30.960]   I believe it was seven individuals. It was actually a placebo controlled study. So, they did human tissue,
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:37.280]   they did seven human beings, and then they did a group of people who did not use the lamp,
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.400]   and they discovered that across the board, the ones with the lamp, and also the human tissue
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:48.560]   in the lab controlled, were actually, you know, had had risen in D3. So, A, it works, okay. And,
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.720]   you know, what was interesting is you don't have to do it a lot. I mean, the control study of the
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:57.600]   humans that were doing it were three times a week, okay. And then if you read, you know,
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.440]   I own this thing, so the instructions are you start out at three minutes, each side, so you
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.160]   kind of flip yourself like a hamburger, you know, you just, you know, and face it, face it, and then
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.240]   flip over, you know, but it was three minutes each side, right? And then you grow up to five minutes,
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.440]   and you do it every other day. And that's what I do throughout the winter, and it's just really
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.960]   quick and get out of the shower, boom, I stand in front of it, put your goggles on, you got to make
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.720]   sure you have goggles on because it is UV light. But the end of the day, you know, this thing worked
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.040]   really, really well. It traveled really well too, because I ordered it when I was in Hawaii,
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.920]   not thinking crap, I mean, now I got to go to the mainland. So, I shipped, you know, it shipped to
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.240]   me in Hawaii, and I shipped it to myself here in Missouri. It traveled both ways just fine,
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.600]   nothing broke. It was, you know, it was a really sturdy little piece of equipment. And so, yeah,
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:44.080]   it's basically on an off switch and a timer. And then you just kind of flip back and forth where
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.440]   your goggles three times a week, and you're good. And so, the other thing that's really important
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:54.320]   about this lamp that I had to kind of figure out, which was, you know, if you, I also use a red light
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:00.880]   lamp, but with a UV lamp, this study indicated that, you know, the people that did it and actually
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:06.960]   showed that they, you know, by using it, they only exposed 9% of their body, 9% of their body
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.560]   to the light, because I was always kind of trying to figure out position of the lamp,
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.800]   where, and where you stand and all that stuff. But at the end of the day, you know, basically,
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:19.600]   if you're just shirtless, stand in front of it, where it just hits you the trunk of your body,
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:24.720]   that's good, and you're good. So, it's really quite simple to use. And I think the most important
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.960]   thing to me is you're asking, well, you know, if it's, if I can get vitamin D through supplements,
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.080]   why would I want to do, you know, and go out and get a vitamin D lamp? And so, the last thing I
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:38.880]   want to share with you is the research, my research that I, that I went through to kind of make that
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.840]   decision for myself and saying, well, you know, hey, you know, again, you know, it's a lot more
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:49.120]   expensive than taking supplements. But here's the thing that's real interesting about the benefits
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:55.200]   of UV radiation over other vitamin D production. Okay. So, while we know that because of the study
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:00.800]   in Seoul, Korea, that you can get it either way, so that, you know, there's really not much difference.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:08.160]   But here's the thing, if you take it in by light, if you produce vitamin D with light, okay, UVA,
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:13.520]   UVB, you know, using this lamp or stand out in the sun, you know, throughout the year, except for
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.880]   winter, then hey, there's a lot of other benefits. And so, I'm kind of a biohacker as, you know,
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.360]   really into the whole longevity, anti-aging, biohacking thing. And so, you know what, when I did the
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.840]   research on this, I'm like, that's why I ended up buying it was not just because of vitamin D,
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.640]   but because the lamp in this, you know, and of course, sunlight, sunlight's free, go out there
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.280]   and enjoy all the free sunlight you can get. And when you don't get as much, then think about this.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:43.680]   The vitamin D lamp does more for you than just produce vitamin D. And I think one of the interesting
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.360]   thing was was that, you know, there's some simple things here. I mean, there's some simple smart
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:52.240]   stuff, but over the summer, you know, you're getting light and your increases melanin in that
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:58.400]   course, because that gives you your tan and tan acts like sunscreen. Okay. So that's obviously clear,
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.880]   you know, it'd be basically you're in a tanning salon. You've got your own little tanning salon
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:09.120]   at home using this lamp, and your skin skin stays relatively tanned. And then that protects you from
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.440]   sunlight, but you know, not not an issue in winter, obviously. However, too, though, the thing about
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:20.320]   it though is that this has been shown as an effective treatment for skin diseases like psoriasis,
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:26.000]   vatiligo, ectopic dermatitis, and localized squirrel, squirrel, derma. Okay, now I also have
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.480]   eczema and my eczema gone, you know, and since I started doing this whole sunlight therapy years
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.320]   ago. So I don't, you know, so I think it really helps if you have a skin condition, that's another
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:40.880]   perk for, you know, using a vitamin D lamp instead of instead of and or with supplementation.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:46.640]   And also, too, you know, the idea here is that UV exposure can suppress clinical symptoms of
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.640]   multiple sclerosis. We didn't know that until I did the research. But here's the thing about the
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:56.480]   bio hacking stuff. This was huge. When I found this out, boom, I ordered the vitamin D lamp,
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:02.880]   that UV generates nitric oxide, which may reduce blood pressure and generally improve cardiovascular
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:11.920]   health. UVA induced no induced, no, oh, yeah, nitrous oxide may also have an antimicrobial effects
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:17.360]   and furthermore, acts as a neurotransmitter. Okay, so what does that mean? Okay, well,
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:22.960]   also, too, I just want to say UV exposure may improve mood through the release of endorphins.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.280]   And so what this comes down to is that, you know, if you're out there trying to make sure you get
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:35.120]   enough vitamin D and you either can take supplements, right, or stand under a lamp or sunlight or both.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:40.160]   And I'm the person that chose both because I really want to make sure that A, I get that I
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.560]   keep it at a really high level, which, by the way, I haven't had a sick day at work for over,
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:50.240]   I don't know, six, seven years now. And so I really maintain those levels as high as I can.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:56.080]   I take vitamin K with the D3 so that it balances out. I don't have any calcium buildup in my soft
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:02.560]   tissues. But the thing about it, too, by using the lamp throughout the winter, okay, it's really
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:09.120]   the bio photons of it is a really, really, really beneficial thing. I mean, I originally grew up in
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:14.720]   Alaska. And you know, cabin fever is a real big deal up there. And there's a really high alcoholism
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:20.400]   rate, a lot of drug, you know, drug usage in dark, cold climates, because there's not a lot
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:25.200]   else to do. You know, and so people get a little depressed. That's what's called cabin fever.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:32.560]   And so, and you know, this light really, really makes a big difference towards that. It really,
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:37.600]   you know, getting that light produces endorphins. But then from, again, going back to this right
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:48.640]   here, nitric oxide is one of the top five anti-aging focuses that, you know, in all the research I've
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:53.120]   done on biohacking. I mean, it's like, there's, it's like one of the holy grail things to do. And
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:29:00.080]   there's this big thing. And if you look it up about, you know, taking NNM, which is nicotinamide
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:05.040]   mononucleotide, you know, it's this big thing, you know, the anti-aging biohacking guys are all
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:11.760]   about NNM, because what is so big about NNM, it, it creates nitric oxide. It helps your body
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:18.640]   produce more nitric oxide, nitric nitric oxide is a huge thing when it comes to longevity and
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.960]   anti-aging and your health. And so what's most interesting, I mean, this is really the most
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.920]   interesting thing that popped out of my research when I was doing this was like, Whoa, this like
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.960]   does that? Because you know, I take NNM, but now I'm like, okay, now, now I know that the lamp
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:39.200]   and sunlight is also anti-aging. So I hear, you know, it's just another plus that, you know,
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:44.160]   I wanted to share with you. I learn, I share, I communicate, and I just really wanted to
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.160]   put all this together and share with you today. So hey, man, I really want to say thank you very
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.320]   much for watching. I hope you learned something. Hope this was educational. You know, the big
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:57.520]   sea wave is coming at us. Winter's coming. Make sure you keep your vitamin D levels up. Take
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.960]   K with it and consider getting more sunlight. And if you can't, you know, get a lamp if you're stuck
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:08.080]   indoors all the time and stay healthy. Okay, don't let them get you. So thanks for watching. Really
