[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K Almer and this video
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.360]   is another installment in the video series. Welcome to Layla Q, also known as Layla Quantum Tech,
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.200]   where I'm going over a lot of the frequently asked questions from new and existing customers
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.880]   as it relates to Layla Quantum products and services. So this video is about quantum upgrade or a block
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.520]   or capsule, which is best for me. So what I mean by that is that when you are in the kind of,
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.680]   you know, you're, you're just heard about it in an interview or someone told you about it,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.640]   or you ran into it at one of the biohacking conferences and, you know, it meaning quantum
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.800]   energy and you want to give it a try yourself. Well, there's a lot of there's actually a couple
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.240]   lot of options, but they kind of break down into two main things. So you've got over here on the
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.200]   left, you've got the quantum upgrade service, which is quantum energy being sent to you,
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.360]   and that includes frequencies or two separate things, or you can actually buy your own quantum
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.760]   device called a block, or you can get a quantum capsule. And those are the two main ways to
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.960]   experience the, you know, the benefits of quantum energy and vibrational medicine,
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.040]   also known as frequency. So now let's talk about the differences of the choices and kind of walk
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.200]   you through, you know, what is best for you if you're interested in doing some of this or trying it
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.200]   out. So the first thing, obviously, you know, the main considerations clearly are your budget.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.120]   So if you're the kind of person that likes to subscribe, pay a monthly fee and kind of start
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.240]   small and pay a little bit every month, and you know, then the quantum upgrade services for you.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.240]   But if you're someone that just wants to buy something outright, you don't want to have to keep
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.800]   paying for it over and over and over, then clearly, then you'd want to buy the device.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.560]   And there's a little bit of difference between the two and I'll cover that in a second. But
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.280]   that's really going to be, you know, what it comes down to in your budget considerations. Are you a
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.880]   subscribe kind of person or a buy? And then also how much do you have you're willing to kind of,
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.520]   you know, commit to this? So those are the two things about budget. I'll cover the next one.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.920]   Now the convenience issue is kind of a big deal as well. Because with the quantum upgrade service,
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.600]   it's all done via a website. And it's kind of like if you're the type of person that likes having an
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.480]   app for everything, you know, whether it's your thermostat at home, or, you know, there's apps
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.040]   for everything now, and you just run it off of a website and you can tweak all your different
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.600]   settings and customize it, you know, the way you want, then, you know, then you're going to really,
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.720]   then you like that convenience of having that kind of digital access to whatever you're working
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.440]   with. Well, that's quantum upgrade. Now, but if you're like me and you like to get your hands
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.000]   into something, you like to, you know, kind of tinker with it yourself and kind of, you know,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.960]   manage it yourself at your, you know, however you want, and you want the ability to have a
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.000]   a lot more customizable options at your at your fingertips. And you want, you know, you don't mind,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.360]   you know, working with it with your hands, and you don't mind, you know, babysitting it and all
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.960]   that kind of stuff. But you like to get your hands on something, and you don't like really
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.960]   having an app for everything, then, you know, definitely the device is the way to go. So convenience
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.280]   plays a huge part of all of this, you know, once you get past the budget issue. And then the last
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.920]   thing, and I'm going to go over this in detail here are the use cases and the use cases is just a
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.040]   fancy term for how are you planning to use this or what do you want to do? What do you want to
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.920]   accomplish? Okay, so let's go through that list in a couple of slides. But the first thing I'm
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.560]   going to jump into the money part. Now, you know, obviously budgets, the biggest deal for all of
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.800]   us, and that kind of is the limitation of what we can and cannot do, or not all of us, but some
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.680]   of us are most of us, right? So I kind of want to just give you as of now, which is 2024, here are
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.960]   the prices. So now if you wanted to experience quantum energy, you could go ahead and do that
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.200]   with quantum upgrade, that's the lowest price point to enter into this kind of world. If I want
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.680]   to try quantum energy, what's the cheapest way to do it, we'll definitely signing up for quantum
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.160]   upgrade. And now we're just going to be talking about just the you experience, just for you,
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.440]   quantum upgrade also does businesses, it does cars, it does homes and property. But you know,
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.560]   let's just talk about you. So if you want to experience quantum upgrade, then it's $35 a month
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.400]   just for you. And if you want access to the frequencies, they're $10 a month per different
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.640]   group. But you know, if you want to just get them all, you just want to try all of them. And then,
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.880]   you know, it's $25 a month for it. So so for a total of $60 a month, you have full access to all
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.520]   of the frequencies and a subscription to quantum upgrade for you. And that's the lowest price
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.960]   point and it's the easiest thing to do. Now the next one up now, if you are, you know, in your,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.760]   that kind of subscriber person, but now if you just want to jump into the deep end of the pool and
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.640]   you're and you know, you understand this stuff, you felt it stuff, you've done, you know, all this
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.800]   kind of like free trial stuff, then hey, you know, if you're ready to commit, you want to do it,
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:05.040]   then a block, the most popular block is called the infinity block. And that runs at $1,599. And so
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:12.560]   kind of give you a comparison. If you bought a block for $1,599, that's almost the same as running
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.720]   quantum upgrade for like over two years, like 26.7 months, you know. And so if you are really kind
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.200]   of committed to this and it's already part of your lifestyle, or you plan on keeping it as part
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.160]   of your lifestyle, then definitely, you know, for the price of a block, you could run quantum
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.840]   upgrade for two years. But if you know that you're going to probably run quantum upgrade for a
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.400]   couple of years, then you might want to go well, why don't I just buy the block, right? It's the same
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.520]   price as two years of quantum upgrade. So, but you know, that's two years, right? So the whole idea
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.680]   here is I'm just trying to give you some like, it's called a return on investment, you know,
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.120]   comparing monthly versus just buy it outright. And then the last part is the glala capsule.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.320]   You can do a lot of the same things that, you know, these other two things can do,
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.040]   upgrade in block, but you know, with a lala capsule and just wear that around your neck just
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.280]   for you. And those run $145. And so that's also a really low price point to enter into the quantum
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.520]   experience. And so, you know, and just to kind of give you an example, you know, if you did quantum
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.520]   upgrade for two and a half months that break even, you might as well just buy a capsule if that's
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.720]   kind of all you wanted to do and we'll get into the what do you want to do part next. Okay, so
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.360]   those are your price point considerations. And always keep in mind, I think the important thing
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.720]   here is, you know, are you a subscriber or are you a, you know, purchaser? And you know, if you know,
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.040]   you're going to do this long term, then you might want to lean towards buying the block, you know,
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.880]   that's kind of what, you know, that's kind of how it plays out. So let's talk about the features
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.520]   or really what are the use cases now when I talk about use cases, it's the different features
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.680]   and what all of this can do for you. And so let's talk about each one of these things. So here's a
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.360]   list of the features in this features matrix. And then the green checks are yes, it does that
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.680]   in quantum upgrade or the Xs or the red ones mean no, you can't do that and the dash is mean.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.920]   You kind of, but you know, there's some you have to do a little bit extra. So there's the quantum
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.520]   upgrade, the block and the capsule. So let's start off with the very first feature in comparing,
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.240]   you know, what do you want to do? And how do you want to use this and what's your objective? Okay,
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.600]   so the first one is the quantum energy. Can I expose myself to quantum energy and raise,
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.560]   you know, my life force energy and my vibration with exposure to this pure natural energy, you
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.000]   know, that's amped up and concentrated. And so now obviously, yes, you know, whether it's quantum
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.800]   upgrade or you're exposure to a block or exposure to a capsule, you're definitely going to be getting
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.680]   quantum energy. And it's the same way with frequencies. If I want to, you know, try different
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:54.000]   frequencies, quantum upgrades got numerous frequencies that come with it, a block, and also the capsule,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.120]   you can have numerous frequencies, but you have to purchase them separately, like you would do
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.240]   with quantum upgrade. Or the difference really here, there's a huge difference is that with a block
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:10.160]   and a capsule, you can experience all the frequencies you want to experience. It's fully customizable,
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:16.080]   way beyond the list of frequencies and quantum upgrades. So quantum upgrade has a finite list.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.280]   Now they do add frequencies to that regularly, and they don't charge extra for them. They just,
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.440]   they've been just making the product better and better and better at no additional cost, you know,
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.560]   kudos to them. However, you know, if you kind of just want to make your own, like, you know, let's say
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.440]   you're, you're, you have a special supplement that you want to have the frequency of or whatever,
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.720]   then, you know, you can't customize with quantum upgrades. So that's kind of one of the biggest
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:47.440]   pluses for the block and the capsules you can customize. Now the idea here on sharing. Now,
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:53.200]   if you want to share your quantum upgrade, it's really quite simple. It's actually built into the
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.080]   software. You can actually, let's say you're using the you for you, and you want to, like,
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.720]   let's say your mom, you know, you know, and she lives in another state. Well, you would just,
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:08.000]   you would get another subscription. And there's a sharing feature, and it's really easy to set
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.880]   your mom up under your subscription, and you would pay for it. And then you can then, you know,
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.120]   then you could quote, that's how you would share quantum upgrade, but you have to pay for it.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.520]   Now with the block, it's unlimited sharing, because you can put, you know, you can put someone's
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.560]   picture in it and send them quantum energy. And so once you buy the block, you've got unlimited
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.040]   sharing, which is a really cool aspect of it. Now the capsule, you know, yeah, you could share it,
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.360]   but you'd be giving your capsule to somebody, and you wouldn't have it anymore. So it's really
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.840]   doesn't, you know, sharing doesn't really come into play when you have a capsule. But with quantum
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.640]   upgrade and block, you can definitely do sharing. Now broadcasting is a simple term. It's called
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:50.400]   quantum broadcasting. And that's simply being able to kind of broadcast out like a radio station,
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:57.600]   right? Quantum energy to people, places, things, plants, whatever. And yeah, absolutely. Quantum
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:04.160]   upgrade has a subscription for locations and properties and, and you know, and people. So you
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.880]   can definitely set up subscription that will broadcast. That's actually the whole purpose of
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:14.640]   quantum energy is broad or quantum upgrade, which is broadcasting that quantum energy and frequency.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.880]   So yes, definitely, that's what it's designed to do. A block is the same thing, but it has a
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:24.160]   limitation of how big its field is. But you can, you know, but I'll tell you what, an infinity
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:30.160]   block, the field size is about two kilometers. So it's a big field. So you know, it's like your
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.560]   whole neighborhood kind of thing. So it's definitely a really big field and anything you put in that
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.320]   block is going to radiate out into that field and surrounding your own home, your property,
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.480]   your neighborhood, you know, that sort of thing. So definitely you can do quantum broadcasting
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:50.000]   with either the quantum upgrade service or a block, but there's no such feature for that for their
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.560]   capsule. Now, another thing again about, you know, customization, which is the idea of can I copy a
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.400]   frequency? You know, we're, we're, you know, that's a huge feature of, you know, of tinkering around
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.800]   with quantum energy is can I copy frequencies and do in the customization? Again, there is no
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:15.200]   copy frequency functionality in quantum upgrade, but obviously you can clearly do that with a block
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.800]   and you can do that with a capsule as well. Now for charging food and charging water and charging
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.600]   stuff, you can't charge anything with quantum upgrade. It's only going to be, you know, the
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.800]   energy's only coming to you or your house or your car or your phone. And so it's only coming to that
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.720]   very specific thing, but you can't like take the energy and put it into something else. Blocks are
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.200]   meant for that. That's what it's designed to do. And a capsule, you can just, you can only charge
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.280]   food and water with a capsule, but you can definitely use it to charge food and water. Okay. Now another
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.800]   thing about quantum upgrade that's just really cool. And it's part of the customization aspect of
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:58.000]   it, which is can I boost up the energy? Let's say, you know, like I'm running at, you know, at 500,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.880]   can I kick it up to 1000, you know, in terms of just scale, right? Well, that's one of the greatest
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.560]   features of quantum upgrade is it has a booster feature where you can boost up the amount of energy
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.040]   that you're getting at certain periods of time during the day. If you actually need it, like,
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.280]   let's say you're at work and you're, you're about to give a presentation, and you want to, you know,
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.440]   you want to juice up, right? And that's one way to do it. If you're an athlete, and you know,
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.240]   you're about to compete, you want to juice up with your energy. And so you can actually set a timer,
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.200]   set a booster energy booster. And then you can get more than just your regular, you know, run,
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:37.040]   you know, run-of-the-mill daily level of energy that's coming to you. And there's no such feature
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:42.320]   for that for the block or the capsule. They are at a fixed level of energy. When you buy them,
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.960]   they're just fixed. And that's the energy that they're going to be at. So you can't increase it
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.720]   more than it already is. So, you know, but it's, it's a lot, but you can't go higher and like get
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.000]   little boosts, right? Like I just described. Now, there's an issue like I just mentioned,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.960]   which is a time exposure. And that's part of the quantum upgrade. As I just mentioned,
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.680]   you can time your boosters. You could time what you, what you consider day and night.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:13.440]   I could set different levels of energy during the day. I can versus night. I can set frequencies
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:19.280]   during the day or versus the night. And I can boost my energy. So there's a lot of, of the ability
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:25.120]   and quantum upgrade from the convenience and customizable experience standpoint, where you can
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.880]   set timers to things. But you cannot. There's no concept of that with blocks and capsules.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.680]   Unless you, of course, you do it manually. You know, if I want to, let's say, boost myself
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.640]   and use my block and, you know, let's say for a work presentation, then I just stick my picture
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.920]   in the block for, you know, for that period of time and then take my picture out and, you know,
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.720]   and that's kind of how I would do that. So yes, you could do it, but I'm putting dashes there because
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.680]   it's completely manual. And there's, it's not as convenient and you can't set a timer.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.000]   You're going to be doing it all by yourself. You know, now the other thing too is in terms of,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.440]   like I mentioned, with quantum upgrade, you can adjust the energy level. You can turn it up and down.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.760]   You can even turn it off. You can pause it. So there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:15.200]   flexibility there in the experience of exposing yourself to this, you know, life force energy.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.560]   The blocks are not once you assemble that block and it's in your house or in your car or wherever
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:27.760]   you carry it. It's on. It doesn't turn off until you disassemble it. So that's a key consideration
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.760]   for people who are like really sensitive to this stuff. So there's no turning it off. And you
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:37.760]   wouldn't want to either. I've got five blocks and they've been assembled for years. But now the capsule
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:43.600]   has a feature to volume up and volume down the level of energy. And it's based on the number of
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.000]   spheres that the capsule comes with. So a lot of people that are new to the energy, they just put
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.800]   one sphere in there. And every one of those spheres is it just kicks up the energy a little bit more,
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.040]   a little bit more until you have all five spheres. Or if you have the petite capsule,
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.440]   there's three spheres. But when you have all of the spheres that it comes with, that sits maximum
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:06.720]   energy level. And so that's, so there's a way to kind of adjust it with a capsule. So there's a
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.040]   definite green check for that. So there's that. So that's all the different ways you could use
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.600]   it. And you can kind of see what the, what what's included and not included on the there on the
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.680]   various options here. If you just want to take a screenshot of this, this is something you can
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.320]   reference back to. And also I've made a German version for our German friends are there.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:30.240]   Out there in Germany and in Europe. So here's a version for you. You can go ahead and take a
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.600]   screenshot of this. It's the exact same features matrix on the prior page, but in your language.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.360]   Okay. Now let's talk about the last thing. And I kind of want to just wrap this up kind of just
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.840]   to help you decide what's best for you and what to think about. But you know, when I
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.320]   would thought about making this video, you know, there's a couple of things that really pop out
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:55.200]   as the big pluses as you know, one of the really key differences here, you know, in the two quantum
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   upgrade or by a block slash capsule. And honestly, you know, quantum upgrade is so convenient. I
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.200]   actually have them both. I actually have quantum upgrade and I have all the blocks. I'm kind of a
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:12.480]   super user. And so, you know, I know the difference and I use both all the time. But you know, it's
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:19.120]   just that quantum upgrade is so convenient. And it goes with me wherever I go. I mean, no matter
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.480]   where I go, it's following me around. Okay. Whereas, you know, if I'm wearing a capsule and I forget
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.960]   to put it on like I did this morning, I just realized I'm not wearing my capsule. Then, you
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.280]   know, I go out, I leave the house and I don't have it with me and I don't have my capsule with me.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:38.640]   I do have a travel block in my truck. But you know, bottom line, though, is if I go into a store and
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.920]   I forget my capsule, unless I had quantum upgrade, I'm not, you know, I'm not, I'm not staying within
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:49.120]   a quantum field. So that's why quantum upgrade is so convenient. It just goes everywhere you are.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.480]   So this convenience piece is huge. The boosters piece, making it simple to use that as opposed
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:00.960]   to the manual way I described big plus. But the biggest plus I got to tell you, if you really
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:08.160]   want to tinker around with the frequencies, then the key that the biggest plus for quantum upgrade
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:16.640]   on top of what I just described is the frequencies. Now for $25 a month, you get access to all of them.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:23.200]   And I do want to caveat, let me disclaimer, okay, the list of frequencies available on quantum
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:31.760]   upgrade is not as extensive as the list of frequencies in on the product site. Okay, so they're just a
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.720]   little bit different than each other. But you know, in other words, there's some on the quantum
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:41.200]   upgrade site and there's some on the device site, you know, the product site, and they're a little
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.560]   different than each other. But for mostly, you know, you're going to get exposed to or have access to
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:54.080]   the majority of them. And the idea here, meaning that why it's so cool on quantum upgrade is that
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:59.680]   for $25 a month, they have this thing called all in one frequency bundle, you could just use any
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:06.160]   of them anytime you want. And that's $25 a month, right? Now if you wanted to do that with the same
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:13.440]   frequencies as on a device, or you want to use it with your block, then you have to buy each one
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:20.160]   separately. And they're they're not cheap, you know, they're like $145 per frequency,
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:27.040]   if you just wanted to buy separate frequencies and try them with your block. So it can be very
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:34.800]   expensive to do with a block versus with quantum upgrade, boom, you just get access to all of them.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:41.360]   However, so that's a huge deal. However, though, if you have a block, you can customize and make
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:47.360]   all your own frequencies. And so, you know, I do tutorials on how to do that. And you know,
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:53.280]   in other words, it's unlike quantum upgrade, which is great because you get all the frequencies for
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:58.800]   really super cheap. You only get those frequencies. Okay, so that's like, okay, there's always a plus
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:03.920]   and minus. And you know, but the downside is you only have access to those frequencies on quantum
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:09.440]   upgrade. But if you go with the block, you might have to pay for like, if I want to try abundance,
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.160]   or I want to try, you know, pain management, or I want to try, you know, any one of these
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:20.320]   specific frequencies that are available, then you got to buy it for $145. And there are sales,
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.680]   definitely, you know, you know, I would say, if you're interested in that, you know, just wait for
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.720]   a sale. There was just this awesome sale on frequencies just a month ago. So just, you know,
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:34.240]   there are sales. However, like I said, you got to buy them one at a time. But but but you can
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:39.120]   customize your own. And so I do tutorials where I'll show, you know, where I show people how to
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.600]   go out in the world and find frequencies and make up your own little frequency sets. And so
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:50.800]   forth, I do that all the time. And so you can actually customize any frequency you want. So the sky
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:56.880]   is the limit on frequencies. You know, if you're into that kind of like make your own and customize
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:03.920]   your own. So that's that's the huge plus about frequencies on the product side that is not available
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.120]   on quantum upgrade. So it's kind of funny, you know, as it relates to frequencies. Each side,
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:15.120]   quantum upgrade has a huge benefit because of all the frequencies for $25. But the blocks on
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:21.120]   their side of the fence have a huge benefit because it's fully customizable. You know, so that's kind
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.760]   of how those two things go. And lastly, though, the blocks, which is something, and to me, this
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.320]   is a big deal because I'm a tinker, meaning I like to just mess around with things. I like to see
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.960]   what I could do with stuff. I like to get my hands on stuff and just try all these different things
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:41.200]   and so forth. And all my videos are all my things that I do. And so I'm really into that. And so I
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:47.120]   like to charge stuff. And more importantly, though, as just a regular person, I charge all the water,
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.800]   I drink, I charge all the food I eat, I charge all the food, my and water, my dogs have, you know,
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:57.920]   I charge everything. Whenever I'm giving a gift to somebody, I charge it, you know, I even charge
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:03.600]   all my loose change before I take it back to the bank or spend it, I charge everything. I'm spreading
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.880]   quantum energy everywhere I go. But more importantly, though, the most important thing is I definitely
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:15.200]   want I want to shoot charge my food and water and also my for my dogs. And that's a big deal for me.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:20.240]   And I really, you know, I think that's important for me. And if that's something that you wanted
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.720]   to do, that's one of your objectives, one of your use cases, then clearly, you know, get a block.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:29.360]   You know, again, you know, so there's this plus and minus thing, right, like, you know,
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.000]   what do you want to do? So it goes back to what are your considerations? And so if you're going to
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.440]   make this big, you know, dollar amount decision, there's an easy try before you buy, which is just,
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:47.200]   you know, really doing the quantum upgrade. So think about your budget, think about subscribing.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.360]   And then of course, the convenience and of course, all these use cases and just kind of think all,
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.520]   you know, think it through. And then lastly, before I leave, I just kind of want to leave you with
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:02.960]   one more thing. And that's the, this is a little tip that if you go into the website and you go
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:10.720]   look under media or press, you know, you'll find a list of all the prior podcasts that that fill up
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:16.880]   the owner and operator has done. And so one of the cool things there is the quantum upgrade site.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:23.760]   You can try for free, which you obviously can't get a free capsule or a free, you know,
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:28.880]   block, but you can definitely try quantum energy for free. If you go to the quantum
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:34.320]   upgrade website and there's a seven day free trial. Okay, so I highly recommend anyone who's
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:39.760]   completely new to this, do the free trial. Obviously it's that's why it exists. However,
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:45.840]   what I wanted to share with you is that if you check out the recent Luke story or Dave Asprey
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:53.520]   interviews, they gave out a 15 day free trial code that you could use when you sign up that you
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:59.840]   can get an extra week. Okay, so if you can get a just right off the bat is a one week free trial
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.400]   for anybody, or if you go look it up and you have to figure out, you know, what the code is.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:10.480]   But if you look at those interviews, they provide a two week free trial code. So you can give it a
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:15.040]   try for two weeks, you know, before you make a decision whether you want to subscribe or buy a
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.160]   product. But other than that, that's really it. And so like, I'm one of those people that uses both.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:27.280]   If I had limited funds, I still probably would buy a block. Because like I said, I am a tinker.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:32.080]   So anyway, hey, thank you very much. Villain dong for watching the video. I hope this was helpful.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.800]   This is for all you new customers and you know, and even for existing ones. You know,
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.280]   if you if you ever wanted to think about trying, you know, trying the other, the other product,
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.440]   if you bought a product, you want to try upgrade vice versa. So again, you know,
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.680]   thank you for watching the video. Hope this was educational for you. All the links to everything
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.360]   is going to be in the video description below. If you got any questions about that stuff,
