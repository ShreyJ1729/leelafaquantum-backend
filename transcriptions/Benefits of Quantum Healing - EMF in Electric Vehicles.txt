[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   Aloha, everyone, and welcome to another Tinker's Academy video. I'm your host, Kay Elmer,
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.120]   and this video is another installment in the series Benefits of Quantum Healing,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:17.840]   specifically to EMF in electric vehicles, and the effect of not only the effect of that EMF,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.640]   why you're inside an electric vehicle, EMF, standing for electromagnetic frequencies,
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.200]   but also the application of quantum energy to mitigate those effects. So, there's four new
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.600]   studies that just got released. They're actually, you know, written in German, so they have to
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.640]   be translated to English. I got the first draft, and then the first draft usually gets edited and
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.120]   proved, and then they have a final draft in English that eventually will then get published to the
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.000]   Leila Quantum Tech website. So, they're not on the website yet. I'm just going to be sharing with you
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.880]   one of the four studies that have been just released because I just want to get that information out
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.720]   there. I think it's really profound because at the end of the day, I'm going to give you a quick
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.800]   executive summary. Driving around an electric vehicle is really bad for your health, and then
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.160]   the other summary point of the summary is that, you know, you can mitigate that effect with quantum
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.480]   energy. So, now, if you'll bear with me, I do want to level set and provide some context for
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.760]   these studies so that you understand, you know, basically, you know, how they were conducted and
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.880]   what the meaning of the information is. I think it's really important that I share that so that you
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.440]   kind of, you know, have the context to understand, you know, what the results actually mean. So,
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.840]   the first thing, you know, is that I think is so important, is like, you know, who is doing these
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.400]   studies, you know, and how, you know, how, you know, qualified are they? So, I guess that's the best
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.160]   phrase. So, I just want us to stipulate that the company is that handles these studies is referred
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.000]   to as BESA, and what BESA stands for is the International Association for Bioenergetic Systems
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.880]   Analysis, the IFV BESA, and it's really run by two seasoned and veteran clinicians
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.120]   in holistic practices who have just been spending decades of their career under the
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.440]   guise of bio-systems analysis, which is also referred to in the industry as Iranian Stress
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.040]   Assessments, okay. Now, the two individuals are Wolfgang Hangs, Albright and Eva Cranki,
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.960]   and their clinician, or their clinic is located in Austria. Now, this, what they do is they provide
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.920]   services to all a range of different industries and different technologies from agriculture to
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.560]   technology to products and so forth, where they study the effects of these products
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.240]   and these practices that people want to have evaluated on what's the effect of people and
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.000]   animals as they're interacting with these products. And so, that's why, you know, just to give you
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.240]   some background, that's all these people do is they conduct studies, they've been doing it for
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.440]   decades, and they're very, very accomplished at doing what they do in terms of evaluating the
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.560]   health risks of all sorts of different things. And these folks have been doing this in Europe,
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.720]   and they're one of the most highly qualified clinics in Europe that conduct studies for anybody
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.920]   who wants to see the effects of what they do in their products and their practices, you know,
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.920]   on humans and animals, okay? Now, what they actually use for their materials and methods
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.760]   of their studies is they refer to as, you know, again, as biosenergetic systems analysis,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.000]   which is a, I'm going to say, a deco vol type of device, and I'll explain what that means,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.520]   where it scans roughly around 60 points along the surface of the skin. So, in other words,
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.360]   you know, an individual or an animal, if they're testing against a product, in this case, the
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.240]   product was an electric vehicle, then what the investor will do is conduct multiple
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.600]   redundant studies, you know, usually, you know, several studies across the road with different
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.880]   participants that they call proponents, I guess, or respondents or something, sorry, I'll get into
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.160]   it. And then so they take these individuals, you know, the test cases, and then they'll measure
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.200]   them with before, you know, before they're ever exposed to something, then they'll measure as
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.240]   they're exposed, then afterwards, and they measure 60 different points along the surface of the skin
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:21.440]   using their own proprietary, you know, analysis device. And what those measurements will do
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.040]   is analyze the effect of the thing, you know, in this case, again, you know, it's electric
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.840]   vehicle on its effect on the energetic systems of the body as it relates to the, you know, the
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.720]   condition of the lungs, the skin, intestines, connective tissue, stomach nerves, organ, bladder,
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.680]   liver, abdomen, heart, etc. So there's all of these different things that they'll test for
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.360]   to see, you know, what is the impact of this thing on the person or on the animal in all of these
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.080]   different categories here you see in the bottom of the slide. So the thing that's really important,
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.800]   though, if you've never heard about bio-energetic systems analysis, or if you've never heard about
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   meridian stress assessments, I want to give you a little background about the science and the
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.120]   technology and the validation of this practice. Now this was developed. The idea was developed by
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.080]   a Dr. Reinhard Wohl back in the 1940s. This was 80 years ago, and this doctor, he was a medical
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:25.600]   doctor at the time, and he became very dissatisfied with the diagnostics, you know, methodologies
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.800]   that at the time in the 40s that the medical establishment had in terms of trying to diagnose
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.680]   anyone of his patients as to what their problems were. So then he could then, of course, you know,
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.240]   develop a treatment plan. That's your standard MO for any doctor. It's like, you know, they need
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.480]   to do a diagnostics, and then they need to figure out what's wrong with you, or usually they guess
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.960]   based on a bunch of test results, and then they come up with a treatment plan. And the unfortunate
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.360]   part in today's environment, in my opinion, is that, you know, they have to guess at what would
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.360]   be the best treatment plan for what they think is wrong with you, and then you always get that
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.920]   speech right at the end of your doctor visit, which is, well, if nothing happens or it doesn't work,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.640]   you know, in a week, come back and see me, we'll reevaluate your dosage or your prescription,
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.560]   you know, that whole thing about, you know, let's try it for a week and find out, because they really
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.720]   don't know at the end of the day what is really, really, really wrong with you, or, you know, your
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   condition, and then, of course, they're, you know, because of that, they're guessing at what's going
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.720]   to solve that problem. So now what Dr. Reinhard Wohl spent decades doing was trying to figure out,
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.480]   okay, now how do I improve the process of diagnosis, so that I can then really understand what the
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.320]   problem is so that I can then, you know, develop treatment plans that would be appropriate for
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.080]   that problem. So then what he did was, is he, he went and started looking at traditional Chinese
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.680]   medicine, because what he wanted to understand was, okay, what's a better way to diagnose,
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.920]   instead of doing all these blood tests and, you know, all, you know, the stuff that they do,
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:59.440]   right. And then so what he discovered was, if you applied the concept of traditional Chinese
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.480]   medicine, because for thousands of years now, right, I mean, this is what's really important.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.640]   If you understand, the general idea of health care is that, you know, how long has, you know,
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.800]   the traditional medicine practices that we kind of are, you know, subjected to in our current society,
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.680]   which is standard American, you know, the standard American care, American medical association,
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.440]   they develop a standard of care, and that's only been around maybe 100 years, right. It's only 100
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.000]   years, but when you look at Chinese traditional medicine, that goes back thousands of years.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.720]   So that's why he looked towards that. And then basically working with those practitioners at
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.080]   that time, they were able, now they're able, because of their training and their experience,
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:49.920]   able to diagnose with quite incredible accuracy. So he figured out that, you know, the method that
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.640]   they were using was actually having the body tell you what's wrong with it, because the body can.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:01.280]   And they discovered that, whereas a traditional acupuncturist can then, if you've ever been to
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:05.760]   one, they'll basically look at all these different things about you, and but they're going to be
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.480]   putting their hands on you, and they're going to be with their hands, they're trained to basically
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:16.160]   feel the energy flow through your body through a system of your body is like a very complex,
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.520]   beautiful machine with tons of wiring in it. And there's, and it's energy, and that energy is
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.320]   flowing all through that wiring, and all those wiring of, you know, those, those energy, what
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.320]   they call meridians, they reach out to all the different organs and all the different parts of
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:36.000]   your body. And you are basically this really complex, you know, machine that's really wired,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.360]   and everything's wired together. And if they get, and they put their hands on you,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.880]   and they can sense how well that energy is flowing from point to point. And so what he did was he
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.800]   took the, you know, basically being a westernized doctor, he decided, well, if you know, is there
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.920]   a technology that could do that for people like himself and other doctors who aren't trained Chinese
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:02.480]   met, you know, practitioners? And so then what he did was he developed a device that could then
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:09.680]   send a particular level of voltage and current, like we're talking microvolts, microamps, right,
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:15.920]   that this device will then basically transmit into the body. And then he would measure it at the two
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.480]   points, the beginning and the end of any one of those particular wiring points, because now the
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.320]   wiring points are all meridians. And to kind of give you an example, there's, you know, here's the
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.880]   map of the body. And so you've got your meridians, let's say here, I'm just going to give you the
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.280]   top one here, the stomach one, it starts up here in the, in the, in the forehead, and it comes all
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.680]   the way through the body, and it ends right here. And this is the thousands of years of Chinese
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:43.120]   traditional medicine has discovered how the body is wired. So he already had a blueprint. So then
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.440]   when he took the technology and he put like one probe up here and one probe down here,
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.720]   and then he would measure the current and the voltage going through the body through that one
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.640]   particular, you know, meridian. And based on the information he got back from the measurement of
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:05.040]   that, he would determine the actual condition of the stomach. And so now, and this is where he
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:11.840]   applied traditional, you know, doc, you know, basically healthcare practices or diagnoses practices
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.560]   against, you know, using this technique based on the Chinese traditional medicine. All right.
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:23.920]   So what he discovered based on just decades of analysis and experimentation was that when he would
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:29.360]   apply the current and voltage at one point of the meridian and then measure it coming out the other
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.720]   end of that meridian, right? If the, if the, if the voltage and the current remain the same,
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:42.480]   then he discovered that it, what it meant that that particular organ and that particular meridian
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.600]   was an optimal condition. That was a healthy person. And this is from measuring the both,
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.480]   right? He would basically measure using, using this, you know, this meridian stress assessment
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:58.080]   methodology. And then he would apply traditional diagnoses to it. And then he would compare the two
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.880]   and over time, we're talking decades, he spent his career doing this and developing this.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.840]   There's actually a device out there, out there in the world you could buy called the decavol
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:13.360]   device that actually is what he developed. And so it's still out there on the market and tons and
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.800]   tons of holistic folks use that in today's world. But there's other devices now beyond,
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.920]   you know, just his device as, as shown here in this slide, you know, Bessa Institute developed
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.960]   their own decavol device. You'll find other decavol devices, one's called a bioscan. So there's
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.720]   other devices out there that are now being used and not just the one that he developed,
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:40.320]   but I digress. So going back to his actual results where he would evaluate using the, you know, his,
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.720]   you know, basically his meridian stress assessment methodology, then he would compare that to your
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.280]   standard diagnoses, where he would actually test, let's say, this example of the stomach,
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.040]   all the different ways you would test the stomach, you know, if you were just a regular doctor,
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.320]   and then he would match the two results and the results over decades of time, he developed
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:04.400]   this device and this methodology. So at the end of the day, if the current coming in
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.560]   is the same as the current coming out, you're healthy. That, that, that part of your body is
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.840]   good to go and you are in a good optimal state. Now what he discovered was if he put that current
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:20.000]   and that voltage through a meridian to a specific, you know, let's say a specific part of your body,
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.640]   spleen, gallbladder, heart, blood circulation, lung, all these different meridian points
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:30.000]   that tied to different organs. Now if it came out and the voltage at the end of the meridian,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.320]   he put it in on one end and he'd take it with measurement on the other end. Now if it came out
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:40.480]   and the actual voltage decreased, then, then when he would go in and actually do an analysis,
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:46.000]   regular, you know, you know, doctor analysis, then he would discover that that particular part of the
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.680]   body was in a disease condition. It was actually damaged. It was diseased, right? And then, and
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.280]   that's how he determined that, okay, if I see the voltage come out lower, then it's going to be
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:04.400]   where I'm, what I'm looking at is diseased, that it's definitely damaged and it's got a problem
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:11.200]   that needs to be treated. Now the other end of the spectrum is if now if the voltage increased,
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.680]   so he put in, you know, a set amount of voltage in current and one point of the meridian and he
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.320]   measured it at the other end of the meridian. If the voltage increased, then he discovered through
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.200]   all that study that then when he went into the look at that specific organ or that specific
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:31.280]   meridian area, then the condition of that organ was in a degenerative condition. And that's just
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:37.920]   the words he used. Degenitive means that it was stressed, inflammation, it was starting to show
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.080]   the signs of weakness. In other words, this was under a lot, you know, that you're having a lot
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:47.040]   of problems with this thing. You've caught it before it got damaged. That's what's key here.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:52.560]   You've caught the problem before it's damaged and then he would develop a treatment plan for that.
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:58.400]   And so that's the actual way to do it. That's the scientific approach that he developed called
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.680]   the meridian stress assessment using a decouveau device, which then you look at the Best Institute.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.760]   They developed their own decouveau device. They do the same types of measurement. They measure the
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.520]   meridian points. They evaluate the organs and then they come out with a treat, you know,
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.240]   basically, well, they don't develop the treatment plans. They just would create the study that says,
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.400]   hey, this is what it's doing to the body. Okay, so they're doing the studies, but this is what
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.840]   it's based on. So when you see the results in the study, I'm going to share with you. I wanted to
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:32.720]   let you know that's how you interpret the results, that this is a science that has been around for
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:40.000]   80 years. Now, as to why, you know, our, you know, the health care industry does not adopt this,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.400]   I can't answer that. But I'll tell you what, that based on all of his work and all of the
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:51.280]   different doctors that have followed his work in the last 80 years, this methodology is spot on
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:57.280]   and it marries directly to, you know, what the Chinese have been doing for thousands of years.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.560]   So the device now, and when you look at the results of the study, I'll be sharing in a second,
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:08.160]   you'll, they basically color coded it to make it way simpler to interpret. And so the four different
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:14.880]   color codes from the results that are coming from the analysis is going to be green that basically
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.920]   shows that you're an optimal energy state, meaning that the current in the current out is the same.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.920]   You're, you're healthy, it's good, you're good to go. Yellow is that it's inflamed,
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:29.440]   it's starting to go, but you know, starting to get stressed out. The blue is degenerative. It
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:34.400]   actually means that, you know, you've got damage, you're being damaged. It's not just a little bit
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.280]   of inflammation and discomfort that you've got some damage and that there's problems. It's a
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.600]   serious, you know, it's a very serious to understand that there's, you know, you're being damaged.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:49.520]   And then the, the red, it comes out, it just shows as your total deregulation. So if you see red,
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.720]   that means bad. That means like, okay, you've got a chronic serious problem with that area,
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.040]   okay? You know, so you can, you know, obviously you can realize, right? Damage does not name mean,
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.200]   damage does not mean you're, you know, like severe, right? So it's just, that's the scale,
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.640]   right? It goes from perfectly healthy to being affected to blue being, hey, you're being damaged,
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.120]   you're flat out, you know, being damaged. And then red means you are completely damaged at that
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.960]   point. So that's kind of how they did the scale. So let me get into the study now.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.400]   Thank you for listening to that. But I think it's really good context for the study.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.600]   Now, there's been four studies that popped out. So let me just kind of show it to you. Here's my
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.560]   Adobe reader. And so there's been four different studies. And so there's, they kind of number
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:37.920]   them so that you've got, they call the study P76 1.0, where they study the EMF in an electric
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:43.680]   vehicle via quantum entanglement using an Laila infinity block. Now they use the Laila infinity
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:49.760]   block for all four of these studies. And for those of you who have blocks, the Laila infinity
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.120]   block is the same power level as a travel block, which is sort of why the travel block was invented.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.760]   So these little travel blocks or the infinity blocks have the same potential as, you know,
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.560]   for this study, you can put that in the same category. So there's just one, there's 76 1.0,
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:09.920]   there's 76 1.1, which is subject number two. That's the second person that was evaluated,
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:16.720]   again, using an electric vehicle, electric car, the 76 2.0. Again, this is another individual.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.000]   And then of course, there's a fourth study on a fourth different individual, 76 2.1. Now,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:29.840]   I'm gonna just share with you 76 2.0, you know, because all four studies show similar results. So,
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.120]   you know, if you read one, it's sort of like reading all of them. So I kind of want to share
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.600]   the study with you so you understand, you know, how it was done, you know, in terms of actual,
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.440]   you know, study on the persons. But before I get into that, I kind of want to explain
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.880]   what the study is. So the objective of the studies was to prove the functionality of the
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:52.160]   glala quantum infinity block by test results obtained by confronting the subject, the person,
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:58.240]   with exactly selected EMF, EMSF. I don't know why they call it that. Carrying objects in the
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.960]   electric vehicle and the electric vehicle itself in order to significantly prove and compare his or
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:09.040]   reactions without, right, this is the before picture without the block and then with the block.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.880]   Okay, so that's really kind of as simple as it gets. You know, before you drive that thing,
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:17.360]   let me see how you look, you know, and let me take an assessment of how your body is, you know,
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:23.200]   telling us how, you know, how you are, which your level of wellness and health. And then
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.680]   they put them in the car for a different, very experience of time. And then they evaluated them
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.400]   after to see what the effect of being in the car was. And then they did a third one where they
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.440]   said, hey, okay, now you're, we test you before you get in the car, you drive around in it for a
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:41.360]   little while, then we test you like what, you know, what's happening to you as you're in that car.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.920]   And then thirdly, okay, now we put an infinity block in there. And then you'll see, you know,
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.800]   see how you're doing after that. So now the different individuals, you know, subject one,
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.880]   two, and three, you know, so they've got different people in the different studies. But I'm focusing
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:59.200]   on subject three right now, but you'll kind of just see where there's different people. There's a
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:06.000]   female, a pensioner is an older lady, another individual was a male 37. But this one that I'll
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.680]   be sharing with you is a female age 62, who actually lived in, they made a comment that she lived in
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:18.160]   the vehicle. Okay, so they took, they just took, you know, the individual, again, 62 year old female
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:23.840]   is the study that I'll be covering. And so let's talk about that study now. So this is 76 2.0.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.800]   All of these are going to be eventually posted on there. So you can easily read the other ones
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.360]   when you want to, once they get posted to the website. So now I'm going to just jump ahead,
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:36.320]   I'm going to make this a little bit bigger so you can read it as well. Make it a little bit bigger.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:42.960]   And let's jump ahead to the section of the study that kind of just explains, okay, what they did.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.600]   So now this is what they did. They went here, position one. So there's all these different
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.720]   measurements. So they're taking lots of different measurements of the person. So the very first one
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:59.120]   is about half an hour of driving, I'm sorry, that's position four, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:05.520]   position one. So this is when they start. So a basic test was created by the test person
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:10.960]   outside the luxury class vehicle, okay, electric vehicle, electric car. So they know this is where
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.600]   they take up measurement, and you're going to see the results here as I scroll down. You know,
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:21.360]   these things are like 34 pages each, so that there's a lot of information here. A very detailed study
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:27.360]   was done. And you know, you can see how they really detailed oriented. So they basically test the
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:33.680]   subject before or outside the luxury class vehicle before they get into it. And then position three
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.080]   is where they're in that vehicle, and they're driving it and they're writing in it for five
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:43.280]   minutes. That's the second measurement. The third one was about a half an hour after driving,
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.440]   right? So half an hour after they drive for five minutes, they do another measurement.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.720]   And then in this case, they actually had the person turn on their smartphone. They had a
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.960]   generation 4G smartphone, they had that person turn their smartphone on inside their vehicle
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:04.720]   while they're driving it, okay? To see, hey, you know what? Does the smartphone being on make it
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.520]   worse? And then after that, then they took another measurement, and then in position six here,
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.080]   this was their sixth measurement, they took a look at the person and said, okay, now
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.480]   you're driving around, and then what we're going to do is we're going to put the infinity block
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.760]   inside the car with you. And then after five minutes, five minutes now after they put the
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:29.360]   infinity block in the car with the person, they did a measurement. And then in position seven,
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.880]   the seventh measurement, after another five minutes, then they turn the phone back on.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:41.440]   And then, you know, in this specific case, they actually had the person put their phone,
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.800]   you know, lay it on their thigh, which is apparently where this individual, you know,
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.400]   this was their habit, right? They'd have their phone put it on their thigh, they're driving in
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.720]   their electric vehicle, but this time again, you know, they're looking at it like, okay, well,
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:58.000]   what happens when you do that with the infinity block in your car? So let's jump right into the
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   results. And remember now what the colors are, so I want to remind you one more time what the
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.240]   colors mean. So you've got green is good, yellow is is you're starting to go bad, blue, you're
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:14.560]   definitely in a very, you know, you're being damaged. And red is really, really, really bad.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.920]   So let's go back to the 62 year old lady who was in her car. And again, so let me,
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.960]   hopefully I'm going to try to remember where we're at on this one, because there's a lot of
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:28.160]   information here. So the very first thing is the very first thing, right, she just outside of her
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:33.360]   car, and has, and just okay, before you start driving. So then let's take a look at it. So now,
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.480]   right off the bat, the person is in green. So if we've got, I just want to point back again,
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:43.200]   what is green mean? Green means great blue means you're, you're not doing too good. And so right off
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:48.240]   the bat, this person is mostly green, a little bit, you know, and partially blue. There's some yellow
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.880]   in there. So there's definitely some inflammation, but the blue. And so I want to point out here
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:57.760]   before I get going too far is that if you look at every one of these other best of studies, and
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.680]   there's been a bunch of them, they've been, they've studied the heel capsule. They studied the
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:06.560]   different quantum block, the infinity block, without cars, okay, with all sorts of, but there's been
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:12.960]   over a dozen studies and every, and even on pets, every single one of them showed that they were
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:19.360]   living in a degenerative state. Every one of them was blue, had some blue, you know, on their
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.360]   measurements. And that just goes, and then, you know, so of course, when you ask them, well,
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:29.200]   why does everybody have problems? And nobody's just, you know, like walking around in a good state
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:34.880]   and bottom line is because of the environment we live in. We live in a 24 hour electro smog,
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.400]   constantly subjected to radiation from every possible device that we're interacting with,
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.640]   plus the chemical soup that we live in, whether it's in the food, in the forms of
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.840]   preservatives where glauphosphates and, you know, pesticides and fungicide, even the bread you eat,
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.200]   you know, if you ever wonder why your bread doesn't mold after two weeks, well, that's because it's
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:58.400]   full of fungicides, and, and that they basically keep the mold from growing. Well, it's a toxin
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.440]   to keep the mold from developing, wouldn't you know, so imagine what it's doing to your cells. So,
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:09.200]   you know, we live in a very toxic soup, every single thing from the food, the air, the water,
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:15.360]   the chemicals we use in our home, the soaps, everything is a constant assault on our bodies
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.480]   in terms of we are always in somewhat of an inflammatory state. We're always overcoming the
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:26.480]   damage that's being done to us, and, and basically fighting off the, the assault of all these toxins,
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.880]   all these different toxins and radiations that we're exposed to. So that was, you know, so at the end
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:35.840]   of the day, I mean, bottom line, we should all be very concerned that that is the condition
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:43.840]   by which we exist is in a degenerative state, right? And to what level defines your level of health,
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.560]   and of course, degenerative state leads to damage states, which leads to disease and chronic
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.880]   conditions. So, you know, you can just kind of figure that out from there. So again, the lady,
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:59.200]   before she starts driving her car, she's 57% in, again, the green, 42% in the blue, which means,
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.120]   you know, more than, you know, she's in a pretty good shape. I mean, for someone who is, you know,
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.800]   any one of us is this is a good, actually a good picture, because we're more healthy than we're not,
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:14.240]   you know, and, you know, living in the environment we live in. So you can see where the, the results
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.320]   show, you know, the condition of the lung, the skin, the large intestine. So these are all the
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.280]   different radians that they're testing to see, you know, what the impact is on every single one of
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:29.040]   these radians. So you can imagine how long this takes to do one study, because they have to measure
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.600]   multiple times. And then for every time they measure, they measure 60 different
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.000]   radians, okay, or 60 different points. So in this case, this lady, you know, definitely,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.240]   there's issues with lungs and skin, but she was looking good, large intestine was okay,
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:47.520]   connective tissue was okay, nerves were okay, or organ degeneration was not, you know, was green.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.200]   So not so bad, sets and problems with stomach, but you can kind of see just, I won't get into
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.560]   too much detail, because you can see the colors and that's the whole point, you know, so we make
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.280]   this video as short as possible. So that was before she got in the car. Now she gets in the car,
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.960]   remember now this is the second time she gets in the car, she first time she gets in the car,
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:09.920]   she's driving around for five minutes after five minutes. She's only two percent in optimal health,
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:20.400]   and now she's 97% measured to have, she's now being basically exposed to a radiation that is
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.720]   seriously affecting her, is beginning to seriously affect her health. Now every one of these,
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:30.720]   look at the level of blue on every single part of her body has now shown that she's in a degenerative
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:36.160]   state, her body's being inflamed, it's being, you know, and if you look at, again, if you look
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:41.280]   at the blood tests that were done by Dr. Rubik on the exposure to Wi-Fi, which is another,
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:47.280]   you know, it's another EMF radiation, you'll see the actual blood, the effects on the blood is
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:53.520]   coagulation, lots of, you know, lack of oxygenation, and, you know, basically a decrease in immune
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:59.440]   response and so forth. So the blood is being directly affected in the exposure of EMF.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.840]   So not only is she inflamed, but she's got all sorts of different, now all of a sudden,
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:09.840]   you can see the extent of being in this electric car is pretty, pretty intense. And so it's right
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.680]   there. I mean, the bottom line is, I personally have never been in one, I've never driven one,
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.680]   and I don't ever want to get into one after looking at this study personally.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:23.440]   Okay, so that's five minutes now. Now you look at it, okay, now remember now she drives now,
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.720]   the next time they measure her, she's been driving around, I believe it was for 20 minutes, and so
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:36.800]   now she's like literally, it's 95, now after 20 minutes, she's 95% degenerative, and now 5%,
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.280]   she's being there, she's actually experiencing damage. There's actual damage
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:46.480]   happening to her body from the radiation from this car, EMF radiation. So this is pretty,
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:52.320]   pretty eye opening. For those of you who have an electric car, I'm sorry, but this is what's
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.240]   happening to your body when you're driving that thing. Five minutes and then, you know, 20 minutes
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:04.720]   later, you are 95%, you know, being exposed to a very harmful EMF, and 5% of you is now starting
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:13.280]   to get damaged. So then they measure her again, and then, I believe this was, I'm sorry, I'm trying
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.640]   to keep it in memory, it's like five minutes. Oh yeah, this is the third one, where she turns
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:25.680]   the phone on, and so now it's 92 and 7%. So now, remember it went from 5% red, now to 7% red,
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:32.000]   after she turns the phone on in her car. So it just made it worse, you know, so it's just like,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.280]   okay, well, how do you make, when you're, when you're exposed to severe EMF, and your body is
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.840]   starting to be assaulted by the radiation, well, let's turn the phone on, and let's make it even
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.400]   worse, which is what, you know, which was what happens if you leave that phone on while you're
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   inside this EMF box. So then what happens? So then they put the, after five minutes, remember,
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:58.240]   they put the infinity block in the car with this person, and then all of a sudden, boom,
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:06.320]   this is the benefits of quantum healing. This is the effect of quantum energy on the body
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:13.040]   by literally not just reversing the effects mitigate. Oh no, this is on your body now,
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.200]   we're not measuring EMF at all, we're just measuring, or this is best as just measuring
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.920]   what your body's response is. Now your body's response after you put the infinity block,
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.720]   or again, if you put the travel block in the vehicle with you, then all of a sudden, boom,
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:32.320]   you go into 100% right there, I don't know if you can see it, 100% in the green. So you have been
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:39.680]   completely on from a bio energetic standpoint, the effects on your body have been 100% reversed,
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:45.600]   not just the blue, but the red as well. So the damage stops, and the effect, the assault on your
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.720]   body stops, and you're back, and you're back to running at an optimal state. This exact
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:58.240]   measurement is the same results as if you look at the Dr. Rubik study in EMF,
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:04.320]   you know, quantum benefits for healing, I'm sorry, benefits of quantum healing, EMF part one,
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:09.600]   where they looked at the blood, and you'll see this incredible 180 turnaround in the performance
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:15.440]   and the health of the blood. Immune response goes up, right, coagulation almost disappears,
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:20.880]   oxygenation's good, you know, so it just really just does this incredible health benefit
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.360]   of the quantum energy on the blood, but then you can also see what the incredible effect of
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:30.400]   the quantum energy on all of the different organ systems within the body as measured through
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:36.320]   bio energetic. So it turns it around 180, this is five minutes with the infinity block in the
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:40.160]   vehicle. Okay, so every single one, you can see it's completely turned around 180,
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:45.680]   and the effect on your body is gone. There's no effect on your body at this point from the
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.320]   radiation. And again, they measured it one last time, where she turned the phone on, and she,
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.040]   you know, this is with the infinity block in the car, then she turns the phone on, and again,
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:31:01.040]   it's still at 100%. So even if you amp up the EMF, right, this is what it means, you're in the car,
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:06.080]   you amp up the EMF, it's even worse for you, but this time she amped up the EMF by turning on the
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:12.560]   phone, but it had no effect on her body because of the infinity block sitting in her car.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:18.880]   I think that quantum energy has this incredible healing effect on the body to basically prevent
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:27.200]   your body, you know, prevent. Well, that's actually the way I look at it. It's, it's, it gives your
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:36.480]   body the energy, right, to basically block the effect of the radiation. So the radiation's still
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.640]   hitting you, but you're not getting any, you're not, you're not being impacted by it. And that's
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:45.520]   what's key here. So then at the end of the study, it's just a summary of the results of the different
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.480]   measurements that were taken. So again, I kind of want to just stipulate that, you know, it's such a
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:55.760]   big deal. This is such a big deal, because, you know, and, and if you look at the actual study,
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.840]   it shows this. So let me just read you what the official quote definition of blue
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:04.960]   means is that basically they do a measurement. It's 50 to zero on the, on their, on their machine,
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:10.000]   but it's so called the genitive measuring the range or a lack of energy as reaction to the
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.880]   stimulation of the system by corresponding environmental signals. Okay. So you're basically
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:20.320]   being affected. And then it moves up to green. And then you are now in an optimal state where
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:25.680]   it's measuring a range of 50 to max. I think it's, yeah, it's 50 to zero, but then, you know,
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:32.080]   50 to max 70 still count as natural, meaning the higher the number, the, the better the energy is
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.960]   flowing through you. And you want that, you know, you want, you want to have a flow of energy,
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:41.440]   the flow of energy throughout your body means you're healthy. And that's what that means. So
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:48.720]   that's the study. Again, there's four of them that we published in the near future. Today is
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.840]   March 26, 2023. So hopefully by April, you'll be able to access all of these studies. This was
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.160]   one of the four, the other three studies, very similar results, if not the same results.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:03.920]   At the end of the day, the summary, I believe that you'll get from looking at these studies is,
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:10.080]   if you're in an electric vehicle, don't turn on your phone. It's bad enough that you're in one.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:15.680]   It is very unhealthy for you to be driving a one or driving around in one or riding around in one.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:21.120]   And if you are going to be doing that, then you really should consider, you know, anything. I
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:25.760]   mean, whether it's EMF clothing or Leila Quantum Tech product, but please, you know,
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:32.160]   do what you can because it is not good for you. And you should try to be doing whatever you can
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:38.880]   to either get a different car, you know, honestly, or, you know, you know, try to mitigate it through
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.960]   one of these technologies that'll help you. And again, you know, EMF clothing is one,
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:48.160]   C60 is another one. But then again, this is the video about the benefits of quantum healing.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:53.520]   So if you want to learn more about quantum energy, I'm sorry if I scared you, but this
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:59.040]   is the result of the study. And it's true. It's valid. It's based on an 80 year old
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:04.880]   scientific methodology and done by a very, very professional clinician. So, you know, at the end
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.600]   of the day, you know, do what you can to protect yourself, especially if you have children. Children
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:15.280]   are extremely even more susceptible because they're growing your pets as well. So anything that's in
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:20.240]   that car with you is being exposed to radiation. So, you know, I encourage everyone to do what you
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.400]   can. It not just, you know, with quantum, but do what you can. So if you want to learn more about
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.400]   quantum energy, you want to read the studies in the future, you can go to the Layla Quantum Tech
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.400]   website. I'll put the links below in the description. Of course, if you're interested in getting,
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.320]   you know, an infinite block or a travel block, you know, that again, that's on the same website,
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:42.000]   link below, or you can find me. I have a huge section of my blog about quantum energy. And it's
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.560]   my blog. It's called the Tinkers Academy. And if you just type in tinkers.academy and you are all
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.400]   window, it takes you right to my blog, of course, the links in the below in the video description.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.800]   So that's how you can learn more about quantum energy. You can take a look at some of these studies
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:35:00.080]   yourself. And if you have any questions about anything that you're seeing or hearing here,
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:05.040]   then please join us. I'll put the links as well in the telegram chat group. Ask away. You should
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.720]   be asking. You should be skeptical, you know, and you should out there, you know, definitely
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.800]   encourage everyone. Ask and ask questions. Ask all the questions you want. You know,
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:19.680]   because this is real. It is validated. It's a third-party independent study that Leila commissioned.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.400]   So there's no, there's no bias. It's third-party. Leila did not do the study themselves, you know,
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.880]   is the best institute that had, would that have been commissioned to do that. And so there you go.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:34.000]   I hope I appreciate your time today. I hope this was something you learned and that you found
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.880]   interesting. And again, thank you for your kind comments. And Aloha. Have a great day.
