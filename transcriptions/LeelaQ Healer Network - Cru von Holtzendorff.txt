[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.040]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and I have got a super special treat for you in this video.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.800]   This video will be highlighting one of the Layla Heeler Network healers, and her name
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.120]   is Kruv on Holtzendorf, and I just want to say welcome Kruv.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.920]   Such an honor and such a treat to speak to you today.
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.080]   Hi, Kay.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.080]   Hi, everybody.
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.720]   Yes, it's an honor for me to be here with you guys.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.620]   Yes, so for those of you who aren't familiar with this aspect of Layla Quantum Tech, just
[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.640]   to kind of show you that, you know, the idea here is it's not just one individual, it's
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.160]   a group of people.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.600]   If you go to the About Us section of the website and you click on healers, that's what this
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.600]   is.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.920]   There's a network of healers that have all come together to share their unique talents and
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.280]   just the energy that they have as one team of individuals that have been producing and
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.120]   helping develop the products, also helping to produce and share their frequencies with
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.040]   you as part of the products that are sold on the site.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.440]   So if you go to this page, you'll find the six main healers right now, and there's a
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.400]   couple of guest healers that have been contributing to the frequencies and to the products and
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.880]   the product development that you are experiencing as a member of our Telegram and our member
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.080]   of our Layla Quantum Group and our Layla Quantum Upgrade Group.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.600]   So I just want to say, you know, these are the healers behind that.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.320]   And so now, Philip has been doing interviews of other different healers, and I've kind
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.160]   of jumped in and I'm helping.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.480]   And so today, we're going to feature Cruev on Health's Endorph Felling.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.360]   And Cruev happens to be married to Philip, and so Cruev has.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.960]   And you'll hear about Cruev every now and then, but she does have, you know, obviously
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.240]   every one of the healers has their own, you know, their own thing going on, and they've
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.600]   been doing it for years and years and years.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.000]   And so here's Cruev's website, and this is her happy face.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.520]   And by the way, I do follow you on Instagram, and I just love your reels.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.040]   You know, I think you're just so happy and it's just, I just love following your reels
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.360]   because every reel just is uplifting, and it makes me feel good.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.520]   And I think one time you're just so at peace and happy on the beach in Costa Rica that
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.040]   I think I posted something like, you know, you just wait to relax and happy.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.280]   I think you need three toddlers and a puppy come back to earth, give this lady a puppy.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:43.000]   Well, I have had those days, my puppies are nine years old, and my toddlers are now 20
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   and 15.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.760]   So I have a very different than, you know, so.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.000]   Oh, yeah, I think, like, yeah, my daughter, my daughter's finally, you know, older in graduate
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   school.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.080]   And yeah, it is, it's hard to find harmony and peace and your true self when you're surrounded
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.960]   by children and puppies.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.040]   But yeah, so this is crew on Holton North, and her website's called crew as in.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.320]   And this video is to kind of share with you who crew is and her journey as a healer.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.880]   So welcome crew.
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.520]   It is such a pleasure to speak with you.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.040]   And so I guess my first question is, okay, so you are a healer.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.560]   So what would, how would you describe, you know, what you do as a healer?
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:41.000]   So healer is a big word, you know, like in general, I, I, I actually like to not be identified
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.040]   as anything other than just me being me and doing me and when you, when you meet me in
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:59.920]   the context of that you want help, you know, what I like from me, then I will, there's
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.840]   not a concept that I work with.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.960]   It's really me reading what is what needs to happen for you.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.880]   And then apply to that.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.840]   So there's, of course, every one of us comes with a certain skill set, right?
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:22.880]   We, we all have core competences, every one of us humans has come here with a set of core
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.880]   competences.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.720]   And some of us develop those core competences over the course of a, of a lifetime, maybe
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.800]   one, you know, maybe two.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.080]   The most of us have between six and seven.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:45.040]   And I was fortunate enough because I started very early to be able to complete all six of
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.280]   mine, you know, like, and, and, and if you know them all, you know, like, then you kind
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:58.000]   of see a threat that goes through your own being like you, I think a big part of being
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   a healer is understanding deeply who you are as a, as a self, you know, like, and then live
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.880]   that and don't try to be anything else than that.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.360]   This is, this is what it is for me anyway.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:21.160]   And I have been very successful with only delivering what my skill set is and leave other
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.680]   things that someone else has a much better skill set for to them, you know, so it's a
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.280]   again, here's the networking aspect.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:37.440]   Like I'm not a single healer in this world that needs to do it all alone, like, there's
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:49.000]   a whole network of amazing skill set out there that should be accessible and, and shared,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.200]   you know, so, which is also what we're doing with little quantum tech.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.000]   And that's why we're like, part of, part of what we're doing is to bring this together
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.760]   to bring everybody together because we, we have so much need in this world.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.200]   So it's great to use everybody's skills and to bring them together and that everybody
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.760]   do what they're really good at.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:27.680]   So my theme in, in my being a healer is to really make you understand that you are an
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.320]   abundant being that, that has everything that it needs in order to live an abundant
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.480]   life, which is actually the most natural state of existence is abundance.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:50.600]   And in a human life sensory experience, abundance is something that is impossible to fit in
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:07:00.960]   because we have the abundance in each one of us is so much more in a hole rather than
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.960]   just in, in something that is so handicapped like the five sensory experience.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:12.600]   So there's a lot of walls that we have to break through in the beginning to open yourself
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:21.480]   up to that there's more to you than just those five senses and that because we are so limited
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.080]   in the way of experiencing it all, we believe that we don't have it, like, and then we are
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:34.360]   looking to still it with all sorts of things, you know, like, I mean, just to name one is
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.120]   like partnerships, you know, like we're looking for a partner that fills that hole within us
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:48.000]   or we're looking for a career that's supposed to fill or consumerism or whatever like there's
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.240]   so many ways how to try to still what is missing.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.440]   No one comes has this idea to look inside and think, hey, maybe this is actually within
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.960]   me and I just don't know where it is, you know, like, how can I access it.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:09.000]   So, so my practice is revolves a lot around understanding first that really it's all within
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   you.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.480]   You don't need anything from the outside that doesn't mean that you can't have love and
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.440]   career and beautiful things and all of that.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.080]   It just means that you don't need them, it's more like you have them because your natural
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:32.280]   state of abundance is, it's already established within you, you know, the universe is a mirror,
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:38.040]   so of course it will be the same in the, in your outside world.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:45.760]   And so that's really what, what my practice is all about is to make you understand what
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:54.640]   the magnificent and divine and abundant being you are and create like the lasting change
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:06.080]   of mindset towards that and then access those all these storage places where you have been
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.840]   stacking your abundance and level and balance out where to all these places where you have
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.640]   creative deficit and that's now a very general, you know, like that's very individual for
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.400]   everybody and so that's why there is no concept with me.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:30.560]   You are my concept as the client and I will go where we can move things and we will move
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.960]   them as long as they need to be moved until something else is able to move and so most
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:44.600]   clients stay with me for a longer period of time, like I don't sign single sessions
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.840]   and you can book a single session to get an impulse but usually people stay with me for
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:58.280]   a year, it's a very intense, intimate, powerful year that will create a lasting change which
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.280]   is what I really love.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:06.560]   I love when things are not just and that's why I love Leela products because this is
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:13.240]   something that it does the same thing, like if I were to explain what it feels like that
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:22.800]   does in a non-scientific way, I would say it reminds you constantly of your divine existence
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:30.160]   and it's like this, if I tell you every single day that you are ugly and stupid and worthless
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:36.680]   you will believe me, eventually you will believe me and you will believe to be the truth and
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:42.360]   if I tell you from the beginning of your life, before you have even any other concepts that
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:51.200]   you are beautiful and divine and that you can do whatever is within your own self-skills
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:11:01.920]   that power you will also believe me and so you see how much what we believe about ourselves
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:08.240]   becomes our reality and the quantum field is a constant reminder now that we have heard
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:16.400]   most of us have not heard that we are powerful, magnificent, divine, abundant beings like we
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:23.880]   have to function, we have to listen to so many rules from the beginning like apply to the
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:31.360]   society that we grow up in which is so different depending on where you are born, so who is
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:38.200]   right and who is wrong, right like in the end, there is no right and no wrong, there is only
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:43.920]   what you are and to understand that and to make that work for you and then you will be
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:50.280]   a gift to this world, a gift to yourself and you will experience a beautiful life of purpose
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:58.840]   without intention because all you need to be is you and that is completely different
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:05.600]   than what someone else needs to be, so to be reminded after we all heard we need to be
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:11.320]   this and we need to be that and we are worthless if we don't do that and so all of these kind
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:21.720]   of things are now in our subconscious mind you know whether you believe in more than
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:29.160]   one life or not you know like for the ones that do believe in more than one, we carry
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:36.880]   on those patterns you know we have heard this for lifetimes you know like how incomplete
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:43.760]   beings we are and how we need to be certain things in order to be accepted and loved
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:53.520]   and all of those things and so there is a pretty big iceberg under our underwater surface
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:03.280]   that believes to be incomplete and like faulty or like I don't know how to say it in English
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:11.640]   right but like to be not good enough basically and now here comes a field in that tells you
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:21.280]   every single moment of presence that you are within this field that you are actually divine
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:30.360]   and whole and beautiful and worthy that you're pure love basically that's what that does
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:40.360]   you know like on a non-scientific way so eventually you start to believe this because
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:46.920]   it's so strong you know it's not just like a tiny little reminder here and there it's
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:54.440]   like these fields are extremely strong so they have a presence within your existence
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:05.360]   constantly reminding you of this and outnumbering or like maybe out voicing the voice that has
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.080]   learned to believe different you know like within your subconscious mind and so when
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:19.680]   you start to believe more and more what that field is reflecting to you because that's
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:26.800]   what it does it reflects back to you that picture your divine matrix you know like there so
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:32.280]   the more you understand this on a conscious level as well and then you start to think
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:39.080]   differently about yourself and and you create a lasting change because really the way how
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:46.920]   we think about ourselves the way how we treat ourselves the way how we love ourselves determines
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:56.920]   the reality in which we live in it determines everything that happens to us oh yeah yeah
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:03.720]   yeah so this is really my that is what my practice is about it's all about yeah bringing
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:12.680]   you back to you making you understand that you are all that you need and I am just a bridge
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:23.600]   or well I know that you you've got some incredible naturally gifted talents and so I think Philip
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.680]   is I think he's described you as a clairvoyant once and I'm just kind of wondering so have
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:34.760]   you always had this ability to bring that out within people I mean what did you what did
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:40.280]   you do like how did you start your journey and discover yourself and your ability to help
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:49.760]   people so I I've been born like this and I I was born to a mother that was amazing she
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:56.880]   was on a spiritual path already and even though she didn't see what I saw when she noticed
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:10.520]   that I see the world in a much more complete version you like or like also the energy feels
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:18.880]   she started to foster this within me like she told me this is not wrong or like I think
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.720]   that a lot of children actually are born like this is just that the parents don't know what
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:34.080]   that is and they you know like turn it down with fantasy or with imagination and things
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.400]   like that and eventually you know that they make their kids grow up and say stop fantasizing
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:44.760]   you know like become real you know like so they lose this ability like I was lucky to
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:52.040]   have this beautiful mother that helped me to keep this gift alive and not have to forget
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:58.920]   myself so that is really been something that has always been with me like even as a child
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:06.560]   I was already asked by a relative you know when we had family reunions and things like
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:12.360]   that like adults came to ask me questions what is suddenly started to talk about things
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:21.320]   that you don't talk normally to a kid about you know like and and I had answers I didn't
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:26.600]   know where these answers come from as a child you know like I just answered like I just
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.640]   knew the same thing today you know like I'm never I don't have a concept in my mind like
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:37.520]   I'm just I'm just answering when you ask me something that you need to know about yourself
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:45.160]   then I'm in contact with your highest truth and I'll answer from this it's not my opinion
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.880]   that that I'm sharing so it was like this is that as a child it's harder to have an opinion
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.600]   as a child because as a child you have so little concept so actually children are really
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:02.960]   good healers very truthful yeah yeah they're truthful and they're they're conceptless
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:11.200]   you know like it's a very it's the concepts can be big traps on this healing path so it's
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:20.560]   good to have little intention and I know that a lot of screaming could come from this sentence
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:27.760]   that I truly believe that if you're intention if you have one intention it should be you
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:34.760]   wanting to be you whatever that entails and and to allow what needs to happen in order
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.680]   for this to really unfold you know like and that is not always just nice things you know
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:48.960]   like if we intent so many beautiful things in our into our lives and then we might miss
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:56.240]   this really not so beautiful experience that would have pushed us a grand step forward
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:03.920]   you know like so like it was for me like that I had with some time I realized that this gift
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   is unique like that there's very little people around me that are like that and of course
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:16.280]   I didn't want to be different you know like I grew up in a small little village in Germany
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:24.400]   like really small like I think we had 2,000 people living in this village and yeah that
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:36.580]   was a very colorful being in a very monotone setting and that was also not perceived always
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:42.880]   as very well you know so I struggled with being different even though I had this mom that
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.880]   told me the whole time different is not worse it's also not better you know like it is what
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:54.020]   it is and it's just different but I wanted to be like everybody else and for a while I
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:20:02.360]   tried to shut that down in my teenage years to maybe also make experiences that everybody
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:08.480]   else made and not know everything better all the time you know like I have to tell you
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:15.520]   like I never really went into these excessive you know like drinking partying none of these
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:24.560]   things made sense to me because from someplace higher or I don't know what like more awakened
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:32.680]   within me I knew this is destructive behavior like why should I do this you know like what's
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:40.480]   the benefit from this like yeah so so I missed a lot of things that other people experienced
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:47.160]   because they didn't make sense in a grander picture like a lot of suffering that other
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:21:00.640]   people had was missed on me because I just I think something was already so I recreated
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:10.440]   suffering you know like on in an artificial way you know like which was my early twenties
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:17.000]   I was an extreme sport person you know like I went to the edge extremely like this was
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:24.680]   all my life you know like I was climbing and extreme skiing and things like that just to
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:31.400]   test how far I can go so there were there was definitely a time when I didn't want to
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:39.720]   take any of this on to and and me being me is not what I wanted you know so and and then
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:47.760]   I got pregnant with my first baby and that called me home like I was about to be a mountain
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:58.480]   guide in Shawnee in France and got pregnant very surprisingly and in this moment of knowing
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:05.680]   that I will have a baby which I never wanted I wanted to be free and not put my feet on
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:12.200]   the ground and I turned around 180 and put my feet on the ground like the minute that
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:18.760]   I knew I was going to be a mother and that was the greatest gift that I have incinerated
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:27.840]   into my life is this child which is 20 years old now because everything that came out like
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:34.240]   to be me and to be nothing other than that didn't take away that I can still do all the
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:39.640]   fun things and that I still had all these beautiful experiences that you can have as
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:45.560]   a human it's but it's so full it's so it's so much better than anything that I could
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:52.560]   have ever thought it could be because being you fully here on earth means also having
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:23:01.000]   to be human and I was very arrogant towards that and I got Lyme's disease to humble me
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.600]   which was one of the best things that could have happened to me and that this trained
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:15.840]   me on this path of really being the healer that I am today or being that me being me
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:25.320]   person that helps when it's asked for you know so it's a it's been a very interesting
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:32.320]   journey but it was a wide awake one all these 49 years that I am old now in one month I'm
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:41.080]   49 years old in this life and I think all of it all of it every single experience even
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:51.560]   the not wanting me to be me is a very vital part of the ability and the power that I have
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:59.160]   today in the healing that I do so that's what I meant you know like like allow the bad things
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:04.200]   to happen as well because they will make they will give you a strength and a muscle that
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:12.320]   that you will eventually use in a very beautiful way and I think that's the same for everyone
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:19.560]   and really everybody around me always my whole life as a child as a teenager is a twin you
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:27.340]   know whenever I was wanting to be myself or not wanting to be myself I've always created
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:34.300]   abundance around me like the life was always so vivid and and for everybody surrounding
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:42.200]   me like people started to change their their lives completely even though I didn't even
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   say anything you know like it's just I think this is so strong in me this this truth of
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:58.860]   what it's really like creation and every part of creation is of course that too as always
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:05.540]   overflow no matter whether I wanted that or not whether I said something or not and so
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:11.380]   I created a lot of wealth around me but I stayed like I said for a very long time in
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:21.960]   this mode of not wanting to do this for myself until I had to do and and yeah and started
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:28.460]   to put my feet on the ground and make this a business you know like I mean not a business
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:35.440]   but you know what I mean like to fulfill this yeah it's a life scholar my my my own journey
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:48.600]   yeah yes or how long have you been practicing as a healer like I said my whole life but like
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:56.280]   to really have a business it's about 18 years now okay um before I didn't do this as a business
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:02.220]   you know like I just was that person that everybody came to to figure out their lives
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:09.200]   and and I just gave answers and didn't make this a business you know like I didn't have
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:18.500]   meat for business because all I wanted was skiing and climbing and and living the life
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:27.700]   you know so in in my in my way like yeah so this is this is 18 years now in this practice
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:34.880]   and of course the practice has changed many times in the last 18 years yeah yeah your
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:39.280]   older website was called path of love but you're still doing the same thing basically
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:45.920]   right yeah yeah yeah it's like I mean I'm being me you know like no matter what it looks
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   like in the outside that that's always what it was and this is I don't do anything different
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:59.160]   than I did um only years ago you know like it's it's just that I know much better my
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:05.620]   skill set and I have developed I have completed these competences you know like in in a way
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:15.040]   that they are stronger more powerful and and the path of love is really also what we did
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:25.600]   is a combined work between Holman Philip and I and because the the skills that that we
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:32.840]   that the three of us have together is just insane like what we three can do together
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:40.720]   and like each one of us couldn't do in a lifetime alone you know yeah yeah it's it's
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:47.360]   really cool and you don't have that so often that something fits so well and creates this
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:54.580]   triangle in which really magic can happen and that's why we created path of love but
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:28:01.800]   the bummer is that real life is there as well and we have all three of us have so busy
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:08.880]   running businesses that we we don't do enough together like we should actually do more together
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:14.200]   and we keep saying that to each other that we are planning to do something we're actually
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:22.360]   planning a retreat here in Costa Rica and we have lots of retreat here in Costa Rica and
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:28.360]   that Philip and I run together and that I run alone but we have now one in the in the
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:38.240]   planning for Holman coming as well and do something grandiose and together here in this
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:46.040]   very abundant country oh yeah you know because I sat in on the last session the three of
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:52.920]   you had for the you know for the members of the community yes yes yes yeah it was so
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.240]   beautiful and thank you for sharing that with everybody and you know I do I can ask you
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.320]   a question though because like there were so many people that couldn't make that time
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.960]   and they kept saying you know are you guys going to record it and can we watch it later
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:10.440]   and and the answer was like no this is a live event and it's it's gonna it's like the magic
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:15.160]   that's happening is gonna happen live and I know but I wasn't able to kind of explain
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:20.200]   why that was such a unique aspect to those sessions right because there's been two of
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:25.160]   them now one was actually recorded the first one and that's available on YouTube I believe
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.760]   it's on Philips YouTube channel but then this last one you know it wasn't recorded but could
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:38.160]   you kind of elaborate the power of those sessions being live and why you know watching it later
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:43.680]   you just wouldn't get you know you wouldn't get the true benefit of it or the true feeling
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:50.920]   of it is there a way you explain how that's so yeah let me let me try to and take it away
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:56.040]   from this experience and into something else like it's like when you when you watch the
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.640]   movie about love like I mean it's a love it's a romance you know like you watch the movie
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:13.500]   you experience it through the you know cinematography like how that works this is a hard one for
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:20.100]   John yeah and but you know I mean like to do the pictures and the sound and and the beauty
[00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:27.340]   of the moment and everything it's like you are experiencing um definitely what's going
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:35.300]   on there if you if you open yourself up to it but then is that the same when you when you
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:41.540]   truly love yourself and you're in this when when you when you experience the the love and
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:47.300]   the romance and everything and like the beautiful surrounding and everything it's a very different
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:53.220]   experience when when it's in your own life rather than when you watch it on a movie right
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:58.940]   yeah that makes sense yeah oh yeah so and and this is the same thing with this that doesn't
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:03.100]   mean that the the movie isn't powerful I mean we all know that that sometimes all we need
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:12.660]   is good to get us in a better place again yeah sometimes things can be so simple um
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:18.300]   or something inspiring that we need to see you or hear something inspiring and then we
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:26.900]   get our hopes up again or so definitely it's totally beneficial to have it recorded and
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:31.660]   watch it afterwards because it will still do something but it will never do the same
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:38.820]   thing as if you were experiencing that moment yourself while it is happening okay you know
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:48.580]   so that's the difference I don't know why that was not my call to not record this it's
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:54.980]   I don't know that was between the guys and I was in Germany at that time and I jumped
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:32:01.100]   in like a little last minute and so I don't know what if there was any other reasoning
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:08.340]   then what I have just explained so that would be something we would have to ask Philip but
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:16.220]   definitely we want to repeat this we want to do this more often we keep saying that like
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:20.180]   like I already mentioned you know like we know that this is so powerful when we do things
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:27.780]   together and then take all of you in there and really create a powerful field that that
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:35.100]   is that's something we should do on a regular basis and we know that and we're we're on
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:43.620]   it you know like to do this more frequently and and I can ask Philip why he and then maybe
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:48.860]   next time recorded again and put it on YouTube yeah well you know your explanation is spot
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:54.260]   on I didn't really think about it that way but you're right because I've done it both
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.820]   ways like the first time I couldn't make it I just had an appointment or something but
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:02.500]   the second one I attended live and you're so right that when you're in the moment and
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:08.660]   it's live and you know you are connected to all of these incredible beautiful souls all
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:14.140]   experiencing the same thing at the same moment everywhere from the world and we're all connected
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:20.820]   that was so much more powerful in terms of me being connected to that then it was watching
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:25.300]   the other one like hours or days later you know I still enjoyed it was like when you
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:31.020]   get to participate that's where the magic really happens for I think for you individually
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:36.180]   so yeah you're right you're it is it's it's not bad to record but you're right it is you
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:40.380]   know because I did it both ways and I got to tell you I got so much more out of it when
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:46.180]   I was you know it was live and I knew everybody was connected right this moment on the on this
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:51.220]   planet together and we were just sharing this wow this incredible healing moment so yeah
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:56.220]   that's a good perspective thanks for sharing that so I got another question for you that
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:01.760]   comes up and this has come up quite a bit in the telegram chat group is when Philip has
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.260]   mentioned you know you had a line and that you overcame it and then I also ran across
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:13.460]   the video or you were up on a stage talking about that once and so that ties into the
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:18.620]   other thing that you and I were talking about before the video started which was you know
[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:23.940]   take you having a disease like that like yours you know it's it's sort of I guess the
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:31.180]   best way to say it's it's part of your life path and it's something you choose right to
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:37.260]   experience at at at you know at a soul level and it's also something to teach you something
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:41.260]   so a couple of questions about that the first one was and this is the one that most people
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:48.140]   ask is like you know how did you overcome that disease and then cure yourself and then
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:55.740]   the second one let's elaborate on that on what that suffering teaches people okay so
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:35:01.180]   there was not just one thing that helped me to overcome this disease you know like there's
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:06.260]   that that was a combined effort of many things and many trials and errors you know like there's
[00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:16.100]   this not I couldn't name one thing so it did the healing from a disease like this that
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:24.220]   also I have arrogant ignore ignored for five years you know like I I I increased the damage
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:33.580]   quite a bit that I had to then deal with by the ignorance and arrogance that I displayed
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:40.460]   to its physical reality when you are born the way how I was born it's very easy to disconnect
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:47.020]   from physical reality like pain and such and hunger and thirst and those kind of things
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:54.220]   they're they're so far away when you live in an energetic existence you know so they're
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:36:00.940]   more secondary so of course that a temple does not want to be treated secondary you know
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:08.580]   like but I didn't see that I thought to be free is to be in an energetic existence and
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:15.780]   not to be bound towards physical reality and I asked a lot from this body I was always
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:23.980]   very sporty very energetic like I have extremely much energy and that needed to go somewhere
[00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:32.580]   so I was in sports from the beginning of my life and I was always taking everything from
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:37.980]   my body that it could give and I didn't give back enough you know like because I didn't
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:43.060]   see that that needed to happen to like this this was not a cycle for me it was just me
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:54.460]   taking as I wanted and that that was my reason why I think in the end two years after I had
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:37:04.180]   loom I got Lyme's disease so that was already on the path towards me choosing to be in this
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:11.580]   human experience and so a very vital part of how to heal your disease is to understand
[00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:19.260]   why you have it you know like so no disease can be healed like by if you if you don't if
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:25.340]   not some part of you understands what what this is for because every single disease that
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:31.340]   you can get is something that will is is trying to tell you something it was there before that
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:36.260]   lesson was already there somewhere outside of your physical reality but you weren't listening
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.980]   because we're not trying to listen to all parts of ourselves we're trying to listen to
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:51.180]   our physical reality so we this this this issue moves through the energetic body like
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:58.180]   we call it all right well until it hits home in the physical reality as a disease and then
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:04.740]   we are being stopped in our tracks and we have to kind of find new ways you know some
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:17.380]   of us know that and they then adjust to whatever is trying to be taught from you to you know
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:21.220]   like because there's no one else it's just you your highest self is trying to tell you
[00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:26.300]   something and you weren't listening so now it's making you listen and then you start
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:33.140]   to listen and then you start to adjust and change and that's not like one thing you know
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:37.900]   like this is a path of many many things to apply that changed and there's people like
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:43.580]   me you know like that try to ignore this and say this is only happening to other people
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:53.500]   and create more damage so it's a little harder and yeah this is this in the end it was many
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:39:03.660]   things what really made me I can wholeheartedly say that Philip saved my life and because he
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:08.620]   was there when I wasn't there for myself like he was there he called me five times from
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:15.100]   work if I had drunk enough water if I had taken all my nutrition like if I had taken
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:23.100]   care of myself the way how I should have taken care but I have not known how to do this you
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:27.980]   know because I never had to do this so because there was always so much energy until you
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:37.540]   know I needed to learn to to become a human and really embrace that as something beautiful
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:44.780]   and nourish or nurture that as well and so he was very when I didn't want to do anything
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:56.460]   about it anymore he took me by the hair and dragged me to the next you know he had to hear
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:02.260]   it from me I have to tell you like I was not a sweet little patient you know like I was
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:10.900]   like leave me alone you were knowing me and I was very ungrateful in fact while I'm while
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:16.700]   I was deeply in this process of pain you know like limes disease creates tremendous amounts
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:23.940]   of pain and even though I was so good at handling a lot of it that was just even more
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:30.420]   than I could handle and yeah your patience goes down and your gratefulness goes down which
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:37.620]   is actually unfortunate because if I have to give you one recipe one medicine that can
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:44.860]   change your whole life and it costs nothing other than you doing it then it is gratefulness
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:53.780]   gratitude is a powerful medicine so I have endless amount of gratitude today fulfilled
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:41:01.540]   sticking this out it's very hard to see a partner suffer in that way and see them also
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:10.020]   not fighting for themselves and yeah getting did handed to him when he was fighting for
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:19.780]   me so it it was not a not an easy path and I'm endlessly grateful that he did never give
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:29.900]   up and that eventually his not giving up made me pick up myself and actually surrender to
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:37.460]   the physical reality and the funny thing is in this journey of me being so sick Philip
[00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:44.380]   discovered his passion for all of these things that can contribute to healing you know like
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:50.780]   so later quantum tech wouldn't exist if he hadn't or lead us to sixty wouldn't exist
[00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:58.380]   if he if I hadn't been so sick and he hadn't tried to find a solution for me so did the
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:08.140]   all these things are have have been born because he was so curious and on always searching
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:14.260]   for something that would help and that would heal and I tried them like I was a really
[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:21.180]   good guinea pig and tried them all and some were more successful and others were not and
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:27.860]   one of the ones that cured my the last pains that I just couldn't get rid of I changed
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:33.860]   to a vegan diet and no sugar yeah no added sugar so you know like I ate fruit and but
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:42.900]   I had eliminated a lot of carbs as well and that helped me a lot to come back to energy
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:52.540]   level what the damage in the organs you know I did a lot of work with 10 units frequency
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:43:03.700]   medicine nutrition like combined efforts but also a lot of work with my soul and I went
[00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:12.300]   to Dr. Klinghardt's practice in Seattle and he had a protocol that includes like constellation
[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:18.940]   work and I am somebody that works with this tool as well have been for many many I mean
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:26.820]   long time before I get sick so I started to do this more for myself as well so it's
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:32.660]   like a it's a mixture of many things you can't address it only on the body and you can't
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:38.860]   address it only on your energy system you know you need to really address it as a whole
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:46.420]   and do it all in order to overcome something so profound like Lyme's disease is a very
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:53.580]   difficult one to treat because it's so individual the way how it expresses in a in a in somebody's
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:59.300]   life you know like and then also what lessons are trying to teach right so for me it was
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:07.860]   definitely to get humbled towards and surrender towards physical existence and not see that
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:16.980]   as a limitation actually see that as yeah in the end this is a maximum freedom is when
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:23.980]   you're free within anything you know like I mean doesn't matter what it is so that was
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:32.060]   it for me and then C60 really cured the last pain that I had which which I couldn't get
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:39.500]   rid of and that that is something he found fairly at the end of my healing journey I
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:48.180]   was already back to doing much better and and actually really good at that point except
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:54.580]   that the winters were brutal because I couldn't get the pain out of my bones and that stopped
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:45:00.100]   completely with C60 I started that four months later the winter came it was the hardest winter
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:06.980]   in Memphis in a long time hundred years or so and it was I didn't have a single day of
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:14.820]   pain and since then I've never had ever again so that that really kicked me out of the last
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:21.900]   little bit and yeah otherwise it was a very like I said great mixture so everybody that
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:26.980]   is listening and has Lyme's disease what you need to find is somebody that helps you
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:32.620]   understand why you have it and what is it that you need to do because that is there's
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:36.820]   not one cure for Lyme disease I think that there's probably not one disease that has
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:45.260]   only one cure yes absolutely but but especially with Lyme's disease it's very with many of
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:53.780]   these autoimmune system diseases you know like you have to look at it very individually
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:59.220]   and then follow that path no matter whether it shows success right away or not you know
[00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:04.380]   like I had an eight-year healing journey like five years of not knowing that I had Lyme
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:10.660]   disease suffering tremendously finding all sorts of reasons why I could have that and
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:18.300]   then eight years to get myself out of that hole so it's not a short term I don't think
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:26.620]   it has to be that long today anymore because today we have C60 we do have the quantum feels
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:31.460]   you know like so there's we are in a very different time today Earth has changed tremendously
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:36.940]   eleven years ago so we have things available today that we didn't have that I didn't have
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:45.140]   when I was going through all of this and so it's it doesn't have to be that long of a
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:59.980]   journey and also I was very stubborn so that also doesn't have to be you are you yeah definitely
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:07.180]   you can yeah there's so much so many things available find that person that helps you
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:14.900]   to find out what works for you and then if you do the work every disease can be overcome
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:20.020]   every single disease because diseases and illusion is everything else you know like
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:29.140]   it's created in order to create an experience a lesson whatever by our highest self and everything
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:35.420]   that was created can be undone or brought back to whole because really nothing is ever
[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:44.300]   broken there's no one ever really broken we it sometimes looks like it but it's not I've
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:52.140]   been in this practice now for so long with so many people with the most diverse issues
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:59.020]   that what one can come up with and there's never a single session the same like another
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:08.020]   and I can tell you everything is in truth hold and nothing is broken I totally resonate
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:15.020]   with that I mean everything I know is that you know disease states are multifaceted and
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:22.620]   that it's not just biochemical it's also energetic it's also frequency it's also bioelectric
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:26.300]   when you're right you need to treat all of that but you ticked it typically though that
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:34.100]   I think every average person is pre-programmed because of our culture to look for that you
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:40.300]   know look for that pill look for that surgery right yes other problems but it's so singular
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:45.540]   in in in its action that it's never going to be the cure you know that's why of course
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:51.140]   allopaths don't use the word cure but it's it's your story is beautiful I I just totally
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:56.500]   resonate with it I'm so glad you're healthy now and keeping busy with all the things you've
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:02.260]   got going and you've got sons who are are at that age where they really need that direction
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:09.540]   as they start finding their own soul mates life and they don't understand women either
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:20.420]   mother you know the kind of guy so yeah like they I have really managed to be their mother
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:30.100]   and their friend and their confident you know like so that is a great gift and I have received
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:37.860]   from from both those boys I think they have become great great kids you know with also
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:44.140]   that was not always easy for them and to be open in this journey with them and include
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:51.020]   them in this journey so hear me parents that have disease don't exclude your children from
[00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:57.420]   this journey because there's so much so much they feel it anyways you know like they know
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:02.620]   that something is not right with you or that you feel miserable you know like and they
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:10.060]   can't handle it like they grow to be beautiful adults knowing what was what is going on
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:16.060]   knowing it being handled you know like knowing it can take time you know like allow them to
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:24.300]   be strong like because they are kids are not weak you know like they they are extremely
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:28.540]   strong if you let them and that doesn't mean just toss them in everything you know like
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:33.900]   but take them along like don't hide that from them like I have this experience with
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:39.820]   tool one was very little he was born when I already had Lyme disease so he thankfully
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:48.100]   didn't get it so for him it was for both of them it had a lot of effect because I was
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:55.780]   not functioning like maybe three hours every day I could be on my leg for years and but
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:51:05.620]   still like they have become such compassionate and reflected young adults like that knows
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:12.980]   so much about themselves and the world surrounding them I think part of that is because it was
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:18.100]   not always everything lollipops sticking out of the ground you know like it was it was hard
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:22.740]   and we talked about this and and I allowed them to grow with it and they did grow and
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:29.300]   they became very strong so that's amazing that it's just it's wonderful that they saw
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:34.900]   you overcome this challenge and that they know that there's it there is a way you know
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:40.260]   because they will ultimately they will ultimately find their own challenges but they'll know that
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:46.580]   there's answer you know yes that's beautiful that's a very valuable lesson for them to learn
[00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:53.780]   well that's been a just amazing story and thank you for you know sharing your time with me today I
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:59.860]   do have one last question the Philip wanted me to ask to keep it consistent with the other
[00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:04.260]   healer videos you know we've interviewed all the different healers between the two of us
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:09.380]   and that last question is you know there's there's so many people that come to
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:13.700]   that are attracted right to the quantum energy whether it's for
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:18.100]   EMF mitigation or medical problems and all sorts of reasons people seeking
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:25.300]   performance better performance and their sports or you know but the one thing that I
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:31.620]   just wanted to kind of ask you and as a healer is the is what do you what is your advice
[00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:37.780]   for people who you know I have just a lot of trauma and because that seems to be one of the key
[00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:44.580]   you know things that pop up in our telegram community are people seeking to overcome trauma
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:49.780]   and you know given the gifts that you have and your experiences you know what would be your advice
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:53:00.260]   on how to start that journey so the I think the first step with any trauma release or any kind of
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:07.700]   hearing is to accept you know like to accept that this is what happened you know like and then
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:15.540]   take the judgment out of it like this is this is not an easy thing you know like of course
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:20.180]   like I do know that like it sounds very easy when I say it you know just accepted and
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:27.860]   I know this is not but if you set your mind to this you know like if you if you reprogram your
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:32.740]   mind to think about this as something okay this happened I don't put any judgment on it you know
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:41.380]   like I accept this to be part of my reality and then the next step is I can overcome this you know
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:49.940]   like to really set your mind in not in an intention way but to reprogram oh no this terrible thing
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:55.380]   has happened to me you if I keep telling something was terrible I know it was terrible you know like
[00:53:55.380 --> 00:54:03.140]   I had a lot of trauma in my childhood it's that was real as real as it can get you know like
[00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:10.100]   and every trauma is very real for the person that experienced that trauma so I'm not saying
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:17.540]   it's not real you know like what I'm saying is stop putting a label on it like it was terrible
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:23.060]   in that moment but let's not call it that terrible trauma or that awful experience or something like
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:29.140]   that anymore because the more we name it the more it stays you know like as that we won't allow it
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:38.500]   to shift transform into maybe a lesson a chance an evolution you know like a trauma can be a stepping
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:43.140]   stone you know like it can be something that catapults you into something bigger you know like
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:49.060]   something that you would have never thought that could be possible you know like but we we will
[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:56.420]   never get there if we don't allow the trauma to first of all neutralize you know like a in our
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:55:06.180]   perception of it and then let it become transformed into this gift that was given to us in in in
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:13.060]   form of this trauma you know like so really acceptance take the judgment out and then
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:20.580]   start to slowly perceive it as a gift and then of course find somebody that helps you to work
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:26.340]   through this you know like it's but you can do a lot alone like I said gratitude you know like
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:31.540]   gratitude for everything that ever happened to you because for whatever reason it was meant to be
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:41.060]   yes it's going to change so much of the way how you experience your trauma and by loosening
[00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:48.900]   all of those really tight ropes that that we create with this judgment on the trauma is
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:55.460]   something horrible and all of that you know like by loosening those ropes we actually
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:56:03.460]   allow the highest self to flow again and to take us out of the trauma world you know the recreation
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:08.100]   of the trauma constantly because of the judgment that we have on it you know like we're recreating
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:12.980]   our mind is constantly creating our reality so if we are thinking constantly about how horrible
[00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:19.700]   something was and we are recreating this horrible scenario and we are we are in a catch 22 like we
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:28.900]   just can't get out of it and by reprogramming into gratitude for what happened and allowing
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:37.140]   this to become something rather a gift we actually are getting into that stream in this live stream
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:42.100]   where it's taking us to be that gift for us and where we get the opportunities and things come
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:53.140]   our way that help us and so it's really like it starts with the mind and then it's again a journey
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:59.860]   of taking everything on but the mind is a very vital part and to take that judgment out of any
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:06.580]   situation you know it doesn't matter if it is a trauma you know like a or if it's just something
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:11.860]   that if maybe it's somebody that you that you experience and this person is really really nasty
[00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:18.820]   to you and then people get really stuck on the experience of somebody being nasty to them but
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:26.340]   they could also just release that right away and be grateful I'm grateful that I'm feeling okay
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:30.020]   and that I don't feel like that person that needs that has a need to be nasty right now because
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:36.500]   nobody is nasty because they want to be you know like they they are because they feel really bad
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:43.860]   you know so oh yeah I'm going to the wrong thing yeah exactly so to to be grateful that I am right
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:49.060]   now in a place where I don't have to be like this or to be grateful for your bed you know or to be
[00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:54.740]   grateful for that you have something to eat or whatever you know it can be anything but gratefulness
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:58:02.340]   is such a powerful game changer in the way how you perceive and create the reality that you live in
[00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:09.380]   so I think that's a really good medicine for trauma and a medicine for any situation where maybe
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:17.700]   trauma also creates you know like yeah that's that's my small little recipe oh that's beautiful
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:23.540]   yeah it's it's kind of like people are trapped with their self thinking that of being a victim
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:29.460]   and not realizing that what happened was part of their divine path to teach them something
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:35.940]   and I you know I don't realize that as I get older I put your money when you're living in the moment
[00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:42.180]   that it's all feary anger and rage but yes and victim you know and then once you release that
[00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:48.900]   and find that gratitude I totally resonate with you yeah in fact you know Philip recently on the
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:54.420]   late attack recently released a new frequency called gratitude and I turned that thing on
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:59:01.220]   for my quantum upgrade and wow what a powerful frequency I thought I was feeling you know gratitude
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:09.540]   in my life before I turned that on I all of a sudden started you know I was just unconsciously
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:14.820]   started just thanking universe every morning and talking to trees and stuff it was just
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:21.220]   the strangest thing but it was just so powerful that the power of gratitude has that it can change
[00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:30.660]   your perspective so totally yeah and that's that's uh that's applicable to any situation in your life
[00:59:30.660 --> 00:59:35.940]   no matter what it is yeah you know that's it's really fascinating because who would have thought
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:43.860]   that the the path out of trauma is gratitude is that so kind of intuitive in our internal world right
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:48.580]   but yes of course yeah it's just everything is probably going to be counterintuitive
[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:53.220]   because we're so programmed to think a certain way and then yes absolutely not the natural way
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:59.700]   and we need to be patient with the world you know like to catch up on those things you know like
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:06.820]   it's like um if you surround a child by certain ways it will adapt those ways as
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:12.660]   as the given you know like it's the truth you know like and then you go somewhere else where
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:18.420]   children were adapted to other ways you know like and then for that these children are
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:24.900]   other ways are the given you know like the truth so there is there's so many different ways
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:36.260]   that we get introduced to so early so we cannot be uh not compassionate to humans that
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:44.340]   don't know that gratitude could be medicine you know like or that don't know that there's something
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:51.060]   else than the pill you know like I mean that that pill that picks or the surgery or whatever
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:56.100]   like it's it's the ways that they had been introduced to and it's such a dangerous business to
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:01:03.140]   allow the world that you know to change because you don't have any if you're not really held within
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:09.300]   your own truth you know like then it's very you're very reliant relying on outside truth and
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:16.020]   and and to let that go without having that internal truth also rise you know like that's a very
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:23.140]   fakie thing so I think that that's the beauty with the Leela quantum products is that
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:31.060]   it asks you it's asked so little of you and gives you so much you know like without you having to
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:40.500]   and it takes you on that path patiently gently but definitely you know like to awake into something
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:47.860]   bigger and that takes different time for different people you know like uh not everybody will
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:54.740]   need the same thing at the same time and and that's the beauty of these fields that they know
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:02:02.260]   exactly where you at and where you need to be yeah picked up yeah well that's the thing you know
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:07.780]   what I have like I've had all these blocks I've also got the quantum upgrade and uh I'm a totally
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:13.940]   different being than I was three years ago when all this started yeah it's you know because it
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:18.580]   like Philip describes it as you know it seeks harmony and balance and that's what quantum
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:23.860]   energy does it's this natural energy that that basically is the foundation of consciousness
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:30.420]   and reality and and when you subject yourself to that and release yourself to it it changes you
[01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:36.580]   you just become ingrained to it and it yeah it's again everybody give yourself some time
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:42.900]   give yourself some time but uh hey crew this has been such a great chat I know you I got to be
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:49.540]   sensitive to your time I know thank you so much for spending the morning with me and I thank you
