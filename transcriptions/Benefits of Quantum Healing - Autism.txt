[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and in this video
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.420]   it is the first of a series of
[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:14.960]   Videos that I plan on making to highlight the benefits of quantum healing for this particular video. I'm going to be discussing
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.080]   Quantum healing as it relates to
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:27.080]   Children with autism. So what I comprises of is essentially an actual NIH level study conducted in India by a group of doctors
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.540]   42 different children within their practice where they treat autistic kids. So it's an actual study
[00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.200]   And then the second thing I'd want to share with you is the testimonies two testimonies that come from
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.920]   Members of our telegram group who have autistic children and their families. So let's get started
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.640]   The first thing of course is the Indian study
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.560]   essentially last year at the end of 2021 and conducted in 2022 a group of doctors running an autistic clinic in
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.720]   India partnered with Leila quantum tech to put together a study the first of its kind
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.000]   To study the comparisons between functional medicine
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.240]   Which is your standard of care and actual quantum energy or healing, you know energy
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.840]   Medicine and so they wanted to know you know if there was any changes or any you know anything that would you know
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.400]   What would happen if they just said okay?
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.680]   Let's treat these children in the normal way and let's treat them with energy medicine
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.200]   but in two different ways and so that's what the study was all about the title of the study is quantum frequency and functional medicine and autism an
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.240]   evidence-based new approach
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.760]   And the thing that I want to point out before we jump into the details is that they how they measured
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.280]   Changes in the children was using something called the autism treatment evaluation checklist or at-tech scoring
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.880]   So just want to make sure that we level set on exactly what that is if you go to autism org
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.840]   There's lots of information about this process this at-tech scoring process that's used is very apparently it's you know
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.880]   I'm not an expert, but it's very common and used in numerous
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.400]   clinics and universities and so forth as a way to measure a
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.360]   Person's severity of conditions and you know symptoms form from autism
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.000]   So just wanted to share this with you. There'll be a link of this site if you want to learn more about at-tech scoring
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.920]   There's actually an active form out here. You can actually if you have a child or someone that you're
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.480]   Working with you can actually you know they can take it right here on the website. So what this
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.160]   scoring process is
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.880]   Measuring and this is what I think is really important is like you know when you say hey, there's been an improvement
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.640]   What does that mean? So specifically the at-tech scoring process has four different scales and it has this whole questionnaire
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:51.480]   And these are trained professional clinicians who are actually trained on how to observe and evaluate and then document the changes of these
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:59.000]   Autistic children so you know it's it's not guesswork these people know exactly how to observe and exactly what behaviors and how
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.040]   You know severe the behaviors are and so they can scale them up and so that these these scores can be compared apples to apples
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.740]   You know children across the country you're in the country across the world in terms of like what is the you know
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.920]   What is your at-tech score meaning? What is the severity of your symptoms?
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.960]   So it's really important that you know this is done in a clinic clinical setting
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.520]   And by a group of doctors. So when they use the at-tech scoring system what I want to point out is
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.840]   That what they're measuring is the severity of an individual's
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.920]   ability to speak you know their speech
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:41.720]   Sociability sensory and cognitive awareness and also lastly their health and physical behavior up to including the you know
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.000]   The doctors actually measured things like digestive, you know, you know health
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.920]   Bowel movements, you know, I contact the whole bit right and so that's what they measured in a very clinical setting
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.080]   So just so that we you know we're all on the same page
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.160]   It's like what the at-tech scoring was all about so at the end
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.480]   You know, so basically and then at the end of the day, you know, this just to kind of just, you know
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.400]   Let you know that the study would reveal promising improvements
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.340]   Throughout the treatment. So let me go ahead and get into the details. So the materials and methods of the study
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:18.880]   Was simply that there were 42 children the majority were male 83.3 percent with the mean age of 5.7 years
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.960]   That were enrolled in the study. The study now was over the course of nine months
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:31.600]   Broken into three-month increments the first increment was where they just treated the 42 children with their standard of care
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.440]   Functional medicine program and then they they and they measured the children using at-tech scoring before the study started
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.040]   And then at the three-month mark after they had been doing, you know
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.800]   What they've been treated with functional medicine and then they switched in the second three months
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.480]   They started doing distance healing
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.680]   via quantum entanglement using Leila Q or Leila quantum tech infinity blocks and that comprised of
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.360]   we had basically went to
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.960]   the telegram community
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.960]   for Leila quantum tech and we'd asked for volunteers and you know these beautiful warm-hearted people
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.760]   volunteered their time and what they would do, you know, the people who own
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.200]   infinity blocks was they were all given a picture of a child and they would place the picture of the child in their
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   Infinity blocks for a few hours every day and that
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:28.560]   That lasted for three months and so that's you know, so that was there, you know, what we called distance healing now the third three months
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.400]   They they switched over now to
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:41.160]   Actually using a quantum capsule similar to that heel capsule that Leila Q offers and it was a specialized capsule though because it had a very specific
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:49.720]   quantum frequency embedded in the capsule and Leila had you know donated and by the way, you know, Leila donated all of the blocks and
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.920]   all of the you know, I mean the blocks to the clinic and the block and the capsules to the clinic so they made one for each child and
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:02.040]   Then each child wore this capsule with a very like, you know, like I said like a heel capsule
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.640]   But you know and it had a frequency that was similar to the focus frequency for those of you familiar with it
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.000]   But it was specialized a little bit different than that one and then the children wore those capsules
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.040]   For three months so then the ACTEC scores were obtained at baseline like I said before it started and then every at the third month mark
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.720]   The six-month mark and the nine-month mark
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:29.360]   Respectively so they could see what was the difference from when they started and then what was the difference between each one of the different treatment protocols?
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:37.520]   The results were pretty amazing among the 42 children the mean ACTEC score at baseline was 97.71
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:45.480]   Baseline is you know when they started so before they'd been treated any any in any manner their score was 97.71
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:52.000]   Oh, yeah, and one thing about the ACTEC score high is severe and the lower the number the better the person
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.540]   You know, you know, basically is in terms of severity of issues
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:03.880]   So the lower severity is lower numbers higher numbers higher severity in terms of symptoms and behavioral issues and so forth
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.800]   So that they all started at 97.71, which is as you can imagine it was that's very high
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.080]   And then as they treated the children
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.620]   The the scores dropped
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:22.880]   Consecutively so what happened was is when they treated with functional medicine the score dropped to 86.51 so you could see some, you know
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:30.360]   Somewhat of a decrease but then it when actually when they went to the eye blocks with quantum entanglement quantum healing
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.440]   They dropped to 76.14 and then when they actually gave the children capsules
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.460]   They dropped to 64.45 as were ACTEC score and so the overall
[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.320]   Numbers that you know when you look at like what was the what was the result?
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.880]   When using the eye block
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:52.040]   The children showed 22% improvement in scoring
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:58.660]   Over baseline and when they had their capsules they showed a 34% improvement and so this is quite
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.280]   Remarkable at the end of the day
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:07.520]   This was a comparison between quantum healing and functional medicine and these are the results
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.120]   Now the study has not been published yet
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:16.560]   It's undergoing peer review and it's to be published in 2023 in a medical journal in India
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:23.160]   So this is just a brief summary of the information that we got from the doctors to kind of just share with us
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.000]   You know, what was the outcome of this study and and and how do they do it?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.440]   So this is quite amazing and definitely, you know, very happy to share this with you
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.600]   And I think it's quite promising in terms of like how quantum healing can help, you know, help these children
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.840]   So that now the next thing let's talk about some testimonies
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:46.320]   One of the things about that, you know, I just want to point out is that this this particular testimony came to me privately on a direct message
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.640]   From a grandmother who was just a static
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:55.480]   Who at something that had happened that they had no they had no expectation and this is what's key there was no expectation
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.920]   They weren't even trying to do anything. And so let me read you know, I apologize
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.440]   You know, I hate putting people read to me
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:08.440]   But let me go ahead and read you what she wrote to me on on telegram and I just because it is just it's just it's so heartwarming
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:16.240]   So anyway, my grandson is almost for and has autism. He was basically he basically non for had non-functional verbal skills
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.680]   They have had an IB which is an infinity block at their house for three to four weeks
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:27.540]   And he is speaking in sentences his verbal skills have made major improvement literally over night
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:33.280]   This was this past Monday. Literally only change was an IB at her house her daughter
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.480]   He was at my house for four and a half days with my infinity block
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.900]   But part of the time I had it disassembled because I was upgrading but once he got home. He told my daughter
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.300]   Cheese I want orange cheese and she was beyond throat
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.680]   He went into school the other day, and he said no cupcakes at school
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:59.000]   That was his second day of school, and it is beyond a miracle, and we appreciate you and the staff
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.160]   And you know what you've done the kid would be four in December
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:08.040]   countless speech therapy O T PT music therapy, etc
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.520]   Nothing and so we had a longer conversation and essentially at the end of the day
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.400]   This little four-year-old with autism had not spoken ever
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.840]   Until this moment and now he's and then I've got a most recent
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.400]   She gave me a little video clip of him, and he's just chattering non-stop
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:31.980]   At the only difference in anything in his life was having and being exposed to an infinity block
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:39.800]   Pretty amazing now the next one here is is sort of the the how this all kind of started was a
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.160]   Telegram friend of mine
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.000]   Had an autistic child an adult son who had autism was pretty severe
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.720]   And we kind of decided hey, let's try let's see see what would happen
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.920]   And so I was sort of like this was sort of the pilot study that the Indian doctors had heard about
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.400]   And then that's how they ended up
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:06.440]   Working with Philip at lilyquan tech so this pilot was conducted a year prior to the Indian study where I was working with
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:12.360]   With this this friend of mine, and so we decided let's see what would happen so a little backstory
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.200]   his son is 27 years old and
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:22.540]   You know if you read right here, I'm a father a 27-year-old diagnosed with autism and his current diagnostic is autistic
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:27.640]   Catatonia with kind of nid defects so before I get it to the rest of it and again
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:36.000]   I apologize for reading to you, but the back story on this is that this child has been in treatment. He actually goes to adult
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.420]   Care facility every day where they specialize with children was doing you know children people with special needs
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.160]   And they actually I don't know if they use the at-tech. I never did ask him
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.360]   But they use they use a scoring system
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:54.520]   You know these clinicians at the at the clinic and they score his child every single day for years and years and years and years
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.940]   And one of the things that he said to me was that for all you know for years
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.720]   You know he drops him off every day picks him up after after at the end of the day
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.600]   And he said you know basically
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.320]   You know they go over the scores with the clinicians and they tried different treatments and and this this guy
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.800]   You know this just child has been treated with almost everything you can imagine at this point is 27
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.360]   But he always told me that you know his worst day
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.560]   You know this his child's worst day is worse scores were on Mondays
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:25.920]   Right because he hadn't been nearest treatments and you know for a couple of days over the weekend
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.720]   But his worst days was Monday and so we decided we'll pick Mondays
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:35.760]   And so on Mondays every Monday in the morning. I put his picture in my infinity block
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.600]   and
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.900]   What happened was is over the course of I think we tried this for about six weeks to two months
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:50.440]   What happened at the end of this period he was telling me that his Monday scores were better
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:57.160]   than any other day of the week and it was the first time in 27 years that he had good Mondays every Monday was
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:02.720]   Consistently good and his scores on Monday were really great compared to the rest of the week
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:08.120]   And that was a complete 180 turn around and how Mondays went for this this guy and that's just you know
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.240]   It's that was you know he's very happy to hear that I was I was very happy to hear that
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:18.560]   So let me just read you the rest of it. So again, he's 27 his child is 27 the child
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:25.640]   I'm sorry. I guess the adult son has autistic cat atonia with cognitive defects that meant so here's his testimony
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.040]   During the pilot that I ran with this gentleman
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:34.960]   He says the turn around was remarkable as even minor improvements are a huge deal
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:40.040]   We've seen a huge improvement in the two weeks since K started. That's me
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:48.200]   My son's baseline at the time was some explosive rage very low cooperation rates and refusing to go visit his mom
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.960]   Three plus weeks and it was worse than this
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.940]   He told me you know during the pandemic it was horrible, you know, all these people with mental
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:00.440]   You know challenges were it's just got you know the pandemic made it so much worse, right?
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.600]   Because I locked up anyway
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.480]   There has been no change to his medicine over that time
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:10.320]   So that's really key again just like with the with the 42 kids just like with the grandson
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.280]   You know, there's no other change so that that's what's critical is that you know, you can you can attribute?
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.240]   Any changes because to the one thing that changed, right? Which is the introduction of quantum healing?
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:25.800]   So then he says the change has been in a constantly consistently positive direction
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:31.480]   He showed a new resilience to pressure to see his mom and a new tolerance for discipline for
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.120]   Pinching and punching you know losing his phone
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.800]   He didn't respond. We were running out of options fast four days after K started
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:47.120]   He was out of the house huge because he hadn't left the house for months and he was visiting his mom very huge and going to a
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.920]   Farm where he fed animals
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:54.360]   Which is mind-blowing because it doesn't begin to describe it in terms of you know socializing and then he went on to say
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.920]   He was initially resistant to some sound therapy that it was donated to him
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.080]   But that resistance has melted away and we are now getting a combined effect hearing him laugh
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:10.200]   And say sure to request for hugs is a million miles away from where we are or work
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:16.840]   This isn't minor for his diagnosis and trajectory in the last few days as a result of a generous loan
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.960]   We've been given access to some of Leila quantum texts. We are nearing 24 hours with a block near him
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.480]   So he's gone from quantum healing at a distance to now
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:32.940]   He actually has a block and he in his home with his son and then basically he goes on to say and he continues to get better now
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.960]   With a physical, you know a block in his home and with autism
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:44.360]   The direction of behavioral changes are what is important. It's a marathon not a sprint
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:50.840]   But the results so far have been nothing less than a stunning answer to tear field feared field prayers
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:56.200]   And so this testimony actually is on the public telegram community. You can go ahead and
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.920]   You know actually search for it. You can find it in the chat
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.360]   And so I just wanted to highlight these two things
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:09.600]   You know the testimonies and the study to kind of just give people give you an idea of what's possible and
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:15.480]   And hopefully we can help you know as a community. We can help these children
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.360]   Using our tools. So if you have an eye block or you you can have you know, you can make make a capsule
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.280]   You know, and you know someone who needs some help, you know, why not?
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.600]   That's kind of what I want to you know kind of encourage everybody to kind of just take this
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.640]   For what it represents which means that there is a very
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:40.600]   Good probability that you might be able to help them and I think that's that's wonderful. And that's what all of this is all about, right?
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.200]   It's helping each other. So thank you for watching this video. I really appreciate your time
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.000]   Now if you want to learn more about quantum energy you can visit Leila quantum tech
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.960]   And or myself at the Tinkers Academy on my blog links below in the video description and again
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.240]   Thank you so much for spending the time with me and and you know what?
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:05.960]   If you know anyone with autism again, I just wanted to just really encourage you if you have Leila quantum tools, you know
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:12.960]   You know, just consider it and I would just appreciate that. So thank you very much for your time. Have a wonderful day. Aloha
