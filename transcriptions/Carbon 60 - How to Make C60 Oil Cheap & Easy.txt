[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another video by me, Kay Elmer and in this video, I'd like
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.480]   to share with you how to make C60 oil the absolute cheapest, easiest, hassle-free way
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.160]   possible because if you've seen some of my videos you know I've done it a lot of different
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.120]   ways and some of them are pretty complicated and as I tinker and tinker and then get lazy
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.200]   about this I've actually kind of come up with the absolute easiest cheapest way and I wanted
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.000]   to share it with you. So let's jump right in, of course we got some disclaimers, this material
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.920]   is for research purposes only, C60 oil is not approved for consumption by the FDA, you
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.360]   understand that making and consuming C60 oil is experimental and you do so at your own
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.640]   risk. I don't endorse products, I don't have a stake in any company or product and I don't
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.880]   get made for making videos, this is just from me to you, educational purposes only.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.240]   So now the method is essentially the quote jar method where you just put oil, C60, put
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.480]   it in a jar, shake the crap out of it, let it settle, that's it but let me show you,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.760]   of course you want video, yeah you want to see what I'm talking about, so here's how
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.240]   I do it, I just made a quick two minute video, the first thing that you know this is everybody
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.200]   can do it differently but the way I like to do it is I like to heat up the oil and so
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.600]   what I do is, and I also mix oils because I like to use coconut and everything I do
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.960]   because coconut is super healthy oil right, so it's olive oil and avocado, no skies but
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.000]   first thing is I heat up the oil and then I mix it, the coconut and I mix it in with
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.080]   some olive, now you guys can make any kind of oil you want, whatever is your favorite,
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.800]   okay so but this is what I do but I think warming up the oil is probably a pretty essential
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.560]   step and then I put it all in this jar and then I mix in the C60 so let's go ahead and
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.840]   just kind of just you know let me show you what I do, oh by the way this is I'm using
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.520]   little jars and little amounts just for you know just for visualization purposes but that's
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:02.000]   the C60 99.95 from our co-op and so basically I just let the coconut oil heat up a little
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.320]   bit, mix the two together and then we're going to go ahead and add in the C60, let me just
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.800]   jump forward here and so there's the C60, this one I'm using a powder, sometimes I use
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.920]   the pulverized, whatever I'm using on hand and I just just sprinkle it in, I'm not measuring
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.760]   it, you don't need a scale and then that's what it looks like, so basically it's just
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.240]   sitting there, actually in this example I didn't really add much but it's just for illustration
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.360]   purposes but once you get the C60 in the oil, there you go, step two, shake like hell and
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.560]   just I just shake it, I give it a good three to five minute shake and then it turns dark,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.240]   okay, normally if I put a lot more C60 in there or especially if you're using pulverized it's
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.440]   going to turn black, so now there's that before, now this is what the after is, so after you
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.240]   do this you just let it settle and I just let it settle for sometimes I forget about it
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.080]   and I find it like a month later but usually like this one here has been probably settling
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.360]   I don't know about a month or so because I just kind of forgot about it but you know
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.680]   you can do minimum two weeks but you know bottom line though is you shake it up, you
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.680]   let it settle and it goes from that color here, well not that color but that color and
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.440]   then it turns into that color, see and then you can see like what I also did is this is
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.800]   like a few months ago I made like three liters at one time and I had all that residual C60
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.960]   at the bottom right of the flask and I just put it all in a jar, that's how all this
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.160]   started in my mind, I just had all this left over C60 from three liters and I just swished
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.560]   up the bottom and I put all the residual into one jar added oil and shook the crap out
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.240]   of it and that's how this started and this is the beginnings of it, so this is what that
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.120]   was and I've been actually drinking half this, I already drank half this jar but this is what
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.440]   it looks like when you're done and then there you go, you're done, you can just drink this
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.720]   as your C60 oil, there's definitely lipofluorines in there, I mean it's clear that this is lipofluorines
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.880]   because it's darker and if you put this in a spectrometer, you would definitely pick
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.120]   up on the color change now that it's been lipofluorized, okay, so now you've got C60
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.400]   oil up here, you've got more, you know the whatever's left over that didn't dissolve
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.760]   into the oil and you're good to go, now if you want and then I'm one of those people
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.160]   that want, you know I'd like to take it to the next step which is also very very inexpensive
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.040]   and that's to filter it and I've talked about that several times for you guys that are new
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.440]   to my channel, the reason I filter it is because I'm prone to kidney stones and when
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.480]   I don't I have pain and problems, if you have no problem with kidney stones and no problem
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.820]   because carbon will just go right through you, but for you guys with kidney issues I highly
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.880]   recommend you filter and so this is how you filter at home, now one of the things that
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.480]   people don't really realize and you know if you don't look it up but you know a coffee
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.320]   filter is 20 microns and so you know if you know from all of the other ways of doing
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.320]   C60, you know filtering with a .22 is the traditional body study method, you can also
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.640]   do 10 microns but you know a coffee filter at 20 microns, that's good enough and this
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.920]   is the whole point of this video is how do you make C60 oil cheap, easy quote good enough,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.440]   so I just use a kitchen funnel, I put a coffee filter in there and then I just pour it in,
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.640]   so I just take this, you know and I pour it in there and it just filters, it just gravity
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.160]   filters right to the bottom and it turns this beautiful kind of golden color, you'll see
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:37.720]   here in a second and boom, I've got filtered C60 oil, super cheap, super easy and I'll
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.160]   explain the cheap part but this is the easy part right and then you know this is what
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.560]   I also do too, this is the original jar and I was just doing this illustration, so anyway
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.960]   I just added it to the original jar, now this one here, this guy, what I was showing you
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.200]   I probably, I don't even think I put a tenth of a gram in there but this guy in here probably
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.040]   has a full gram left over from the other three, you know, runs, so anyway so I just pour it
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.960]   back in the original and one of the things too, I just want to point out that if you shake
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.280]   it really well, you know, you're not going to get any residual in there like see, there's
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.480]   almost nothing but then here's my original jar, I added more oil to it, this is what
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.160]   I do right, so this is really kind of I want to point that out, whenever I empty it out
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.520]   there's still C60 in the bottom, add more oil, shake, rinse, repeat, keep doing it and
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.280]   you're good, so there you go and then I just keep doing it until there's no C60, but anyway
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.880]   look at that, there you go, it went and look at this nice beautiful golden color, by the
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:39.520]   way it's golden because the PC60, that's in the bottom of this guy, is the new red lion
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:48.400]   PC60 that doesn't turn red and so when you finish it's going to look like this, but it
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.400]   is C60, this is all lipo fullerenes in here, believe me because I've been drinking this
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.240]   and if you saw my snake bite video, oh oh and the dogs love C60, I just want to throw
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:04.760]   this in because I love my dogs, that's peaches, that's the puppy six months old now, and Norman
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.440]   and I give my dogs C60 every day, but let me jump back to the spider bite, if you saw
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.600]   my spider bite video, I'm taking the new PC60 from red lion, the one that doesn't turn
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.720]   golden and not red and that's what I was taking when I had my spider bite and like I said
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.080]   in that video, it totally took care, I didn't have any effects from the toxins from the
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.480]   bite and so that to me is how I know it's working and I've been eating food that I know
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:40.440]   has MSG and I have no reaction to the MSG, so when I'm saying that this works, I mean
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:47.360]   that when I've been taking this oil done with the jar method and I have no problems eating
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.880]   MSG, no reaction to the black widow spider bite, it is doing what it does because otherwise
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.520]   those toxins, whether it's a neural toxin MSG or a black widow spider bite, that would
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.360]   have sent me to the ER, I mean really, you know, but I didn't, I just, I didn't even
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.360]   have a reaction to it, as you saw from the other video, the reaction was the wound but
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.280]   not the, the toxins, so that's how to do it, it's as simple as that, now what it costs
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.280]   and this is the cheap part, covered the easy part, but the cheap part is this, now I get
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.200]   my C60 powder from our telegram C60 co-op, for those of you who've joined the co-op,
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:28.800]   you know that we, we have this co-op where we have this one gentleman who is like just
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:37.200]   an angel, I mean he lays out his own money, buys bulk C60 like a lot of it at a low prices
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.620]   because he's buying bulk and then he redistributes it to members of the C60 chat, there's nothing
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.520]   that doesn't cost anything to join, it's just, you know, part of our community, it's
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.080]   like we have a maker's community, people who make their own, right, and they're all on,
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.840]   they're all on telegram, we have our own chat group and you just hook up with this gentleman,
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.480]   you can go to the, go to the telegram chat group, if you looked at the pin message, it
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:06.680]   will tell you how to do it and then what right now, you know, he's has available 99.95C60
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:13.560]   for 120 gram and for those of you who make C60, you know that it retails at 245, so I
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.480]   mean 120 is a hell of a deal and now that's just for the regular, that's just regular
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:26.320]   old C60 powder, okay, now if we've all, he's also got sublime C60 right now going for 160
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.200]   gram, so you can get either one, I got the cheaper one, I just happen to have a bunch
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.080]   of it, so I was just going to use it up, so it's 120, this is what it costs me to make
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:41.320]   a liter, the jar method, one gram at 120, get a decent liter of some decent kind of oil
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.960]   like around 20 bucks, and you know, and I'm not even going for like the fanciest kind
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.080]   of oil, I'm just going for just, you know, a decent olive oil, avocado, coconut, I'm
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.120]   a lot less anal or attentive about it now, after doing this two years, so any decent
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:00.000]   kind of oil, these are my four favorites, coconut, avocado, MCT or olive, or a mixture
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.520]   as you saw, and that's just 20 bucks, that's it, and then the rest of the stuff is stuff
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.200]   you already have at home, it doesn't cost you nothing, everybody has a couple of jars,
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.840]   you could use like a, you know, a pizza sauce, you know, I mean a spaghetti sauce jar, just
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.040]   clean it, you know, but you could use any kind of jar, you only need two jars or one
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.400]   jar, right, so there you go, and then the funnel and the coffee filter, well that's
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.880]   filtering is optional as I explained, so that doesn't cost you anything if you don't
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.320]   need to do it, and there you go, you have zero equipment costs, okay, and so it's 140,
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.600]   now you know that one liter has 35 ounces in it, one ounce is a little jar, these little
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.360]   bottles that you see sold on just tons of different websites, and they go from anywhere
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:43.720]   from, these little bottles go from anywhere from like 15 to 30 bucks a bottle, right,
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:49.720]   but you're making it at this, the jar method, going through the co-op, four bucks an ounce,
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:55.280]   four dollars an ounce, that's it, and one liter for me lasts me a whole month, so it's
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:01.800]   a great, it's a great deal, easy way to make it, hassle free, you can do it, it's so simple,
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:07.160]   you don't even have to go on Amazon, so there you go, that's my easiest, fastest, cheapest
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:13.760]   way to do it, shortest video, thank you for watching, I really appreciate your patronage,
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.840]   thanks for the great comments, if you got any questions, just jump on there, you know,
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.080]   if you're making it your own way, you want to use a sonicator, stirs, any kind of question
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.920]   you want, about any of the kind of the equipment or the way to do it, just hey, jump on in,
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.160]   we also post a whole bunch of, you know, updates on what's going on out there, I mean, I and
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.560]   Mitchell had a recent, great interview, that's been posted to the chat, I mean there's all
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:42.600]   this great stuff, if you're interested in C60 and what C60 can do, so there you go, link
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.800]   to join the Telegram C60 chat group in the video description, thank you again for watching,
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:53.040]   I really appreciate it, I appreciate your time, and hey, you know what, take C60, don't forget
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:59.360]   your dogs, my dogs love C60, I give them both a dropper every day and they love it, I mean,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.160]   you can tell when I don't give them, they get a little list list, the chubby old one
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:09.080]   does, the puppy never gets list list, but Norman, you know what, he's an older dog,
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.320]   he's six years old, he's overweight, like me, we're both working on it right now, we're
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.760]   trying to lose the weight, but I give him C60 every day and I'll tell you what, the difference
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.280]   between giving it to him and not, it's night and day, so I mean, your dogs love it, it's
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.440]   great for them, just like it's great for you, and hey, you know what, good health to you,
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.160]   thank you very much for watching, aloha, have a great day.
