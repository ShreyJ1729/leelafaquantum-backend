[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host, K Almer, and this
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.800]   video is another installment in the video series. Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla Quantum
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.840]   Tech and Quantum Upgrade. The question we're answering today for our video FAQ series is the
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.000]   concept of quantum energy exposure effects. I had this really great chat with Philip Von Holtsendorf,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.560]   the owner operator of Layla Quantum Tech, and I just wanted to kind of just, you know, ask him
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.520]   some questions that were popping up in our Telegram chat group regarding some of the different exposure
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.120]   effects when people are starting, you know, brand new and/or have been using quantum energy for a
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.920]   little while, you know, the tools and quantum upgrade. And so we cover specifically, you know,
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.200]   the idea of, you know, the approach, the best approach for quantum energy for individuals with
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.680]   chronic conditions, the idea of quantum hormesis, we also talk about, you know, is stronger and stronger
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.440]   quantum energy, you know, like upgrading your infinity blocks, turning up your boosters.
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.520]   You know, what's that effect? And is that really necessary for more and more and more energy?
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.720]   Because everyone, you know, seems to be, or a lot of people in the chat group are just really focused
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.520]   in on getting the strongest block or, you know, getting the stronger energy and getting more and
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.400]   more energy into their lives. And, you know, is that necessary? And what did Philip think about that?
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.880]   And lastly, you know, I threw a question at him that popped up in our Telegram chat group
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.880]   about, you know, people that are, you know, going to their doctors and getting tests and blood tests
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.160]   specifically, you know, specifically, whether or not, you know, should they be turning off their
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.240]   quantum, you know, energy for those tests? And, you know, and what did he think about, you know,
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.320]   people being diagnosed against perfect blood, you know, you know, when they're under the quantum
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.800]   energy bubble versus just, you know, their normal, not perfect blood, I guess, is the best way to
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.600]   say it. So, so this is what Philip had to say. It was a great conversation. I just wanted to share
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.200]   with you and, and, and help you learn something. So here you go. The next question here is exposure
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.200]   effect. You know, there's, there's all these different effects from exposure to quantum energy.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.320]   And so could you kind of elaborate on, on, on what that, what that situation is and what your
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.440]   recommendation is for quantum energy as it relates to chronically ill people?
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.040]   Yeah, I think it's a really good question because we find these chronic issues and autoimmune
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.800]   diseases and all of that more and more. And it's, it's, it's all been coming through this
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:36.000]   modern way of living, which includes blue light, which includes, you know, the blue light for people
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.560]   that don't understand what I'm talking about. Every time you look at your phone or on any other
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.360]   screen, you basically have blue light. Now in your home at home, you used to have these
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.800]   hot light bulbs or the light bulbs that get hot, right? Those at least had more beneficial light.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:01.200]   And now the light spectrum is basically just LED blue light. So everywhere we go, this has a
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.880]   huge impact on our melanin in the body and other factors. It's very bad. We have the EMFs and then,
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.240]   you know, obviously we have depletion in soil and, and, and food nutrition and all of that.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:22.400]   So that's how we develop these more chronic diseases. And if you think about what the quantum
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.160]   technology does, it helps with these things, with all of these items, with these stressors,
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.960]   with these modern stressors. So to me, if there's a family member that has
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.480]   or a friend with a chronic disease, I personally would always recommend this to be the first thing
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.440]   to do to, to use the quantum technology. And then, of course, do all the other great things that
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:59.680]   are helpful. We don't need to get into details here, but that's what I always recommend. I would
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.840]   not fear at all some detox effects because those are quite positive even and just
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.000]   the way to deal with that is just in the beginning, take it easy. And we, we get accustomed to this
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.040]   energy so quickly also because it is so natural, right? It's nothing artificial that I don't think
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.840]   this is really a big deal at all. We can, we can just watch it in the first week or two and then
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.560]   just gradually always, already after the second, third day, we can start ramping it up a little bit.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:42.640]   If we feel in the first two, three days that there's, oh, yeah, you know, maybe it's a lot. Maybe
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.720]   I'm detoxing a lot. Well, just take a day break and then go at it again or scale it down a little
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.760]   bit and then keep at it. But after two, three, four weeks, you should be on a, on a pretty solid
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   level already and it shouldn't be a problem. So I think definitely go for it. Don't, don't forget
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.440]   to drink good water. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's, yeah. My recommendation for that is, you know,
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.600]   go slow and go low and observe and adjust. Yes. Correct. That is correct. All right. Great.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.440]   Yeah. Yeah. Because I know that it's beneficial. It's just that you got, you know, I, I'm just,
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.800]   you know, I err on the side of caution, but okay, that's great. I'm glad that we align on that.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.040]   On that recommendation. So everybody out there, you know, there's, there's the answer.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.720]   The other question that I've got, and this is something, you know, that comes up a lot
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.280]   in the C 60 world and I and has talked about this with C 60, which is the
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.160]   hormetic effect and hormesis. And what I mean by that for people that don't know that word is,
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.200]   is not all, you know, in other words, you just kind of want to vary your intake of a certain
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.160]   supplement so your body doesn't get used to it and get dependent on it or just start to ignore it.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.760]   So you want to like taper off, maybe skip a few. This is about supplements. You know,
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.120]   you want to skip a few days, you know, change out your routine, but always exposing your body to
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.680]   different, you know, the different levels of it and spacing it out so that your body never gets
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.840]   overly used to something and dependent on something, right? And that supplements.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.720]   So I'm wondering, and this has come up with, is there such a thing as a quantum hormesis effect,
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.920]   where is it, is it a good idea that, you know, like to maybe like kind of turn this stuff off for a
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.320]   little while and kind of just, you know, level set and then, you know, not always have it at the same
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.280]   power every single day, not have your boosters at the same time every day, you know, and then maybe
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.880]   take your stuff off for a day, you know, but should people be like varying their level of exposure
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.160]   over over time, you know, to kind of create that hormesis effect so that their bodies don't become
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.200]   dependent on this external energy source? What are your thoughts on that?
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.360]   Yeah, another great question. I don't see that there's any issue with that because
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:01.120]   the way that this works is very different from any physical, compared to any physical
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:09.040]   intervention that we know of, or that I know of at least, because you can indeed, if you take
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.920]   vitamin C, well, maybe vitamin C is not a good idea because the body doesn't really produce it
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:21.920]   anymore, but let's take any other supplement. You take it literally every day, then you become
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:29.360]   used to it and then maybe with certain substances, the body will just not produce it anymore just
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:36.960]   because, yeah, you're constantly feeding it, right? So I think there's always a good point on mixing
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:44.400]   that up or just taking a daybreak, maybe every other week or maybe once a week and maybe changing
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.320]   up the times also when you take it, stuff like that. With quantum energy and also these frequencies,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:59.360]   it's different because it actually reminds our biofield on how this state is and it can then
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:06.160]   establish it easier, if that makes sense. So if I have someone that never had a blog and then they
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:12.240]   suddenly live with a blog for two, three weeks and then they go to town compared to three weeks
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.160]   prior when they went to town, now they're going to town with a much higher vibration in their
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:30.000]   biofield. It's much stronger, unless there are other things that I may be doing on this specific
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.680]   day that would cripple my biofield, right? I don't know what that would be, but maybe I
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:43.440]   expose myself to witchcraft and tell myself for three hours that I hate myself and stuff like that,
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:50.800]   right? With these efforts, I could start to destroy my biofield, right? But if I don't do any of those
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:57.840]   things and it's basically pretty similar to how it was three weeks ago, I have such a stronger
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:06.480]   biofield just even when I turn off the quantum upgrade or the take away the block because it
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:14.480]   trains our system. So because it is so natural, it's so inherent to our own existence, it doesn't
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:23.680]   do that. There is not too much of it really. There isn't that you need to not do it on Sundays
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.600]   just so that you don't become too used to it. We haven't seen any of that yet.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:38.880]   Okay, that's great to know. And tied to that question is the idea of everybody, or not everybody,
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:46.960]   but there's so many members that are really interested and are pursuing stronger and stronger
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:52.080]   and stronger energy, right? They want to buy the most recent strongest block. They want to upgrade
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.480]   more and more. They want to upgrade their capsules. There's all these people, myself included,
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.000]   that are just seeking stronger and stronger and stronger energy. So is that even necessary?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.560]   And what are the effects of that? And where does that go in terms of once you kind of
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.800]   establish a really strong biofield, is it even an issue? And what happens if I keep increasing
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:20.480]   my energy? We've got individuals out there that are out that have literally upgraded their infinity
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:25.120]   blocks, like dozens of times, and they're really high numbers at this point.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.760]   So yeah, what about that? You know, that's the question is like, what up with the
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:36.480]   pursuit of stronger quantum energy? And what happens over time in your opinion?
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:45.040]   So the most important thing is to understand is that it's very individual. It's not the same
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:57.280]   for everyone. And we, all of each of us, has the responsibility to tune in and to figure out what
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:08.080]   is the right thing for us personally, without the regular modern desire of having the strongest
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:17.440]   and fastest and whatever at all times. Now, I want to say that the new infinity block that
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:25.280]   we launched this year is definitely much better than the one that we still had a year prior. But
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:32.240]   that had not necessarily something to do with just the power. It really had a lot to do with it with
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:37.200]   the actual features. So I just want to make that clear. So I do understand why people want to
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.480]   certainly have the newest of that, because it has all these greatest features. And then you can
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:53.200]   even have higher energy levels that are even more harmonious and all of these things. So that's a
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:12:04.400]   great thing. But leveling up isn't, I think it really depends on what we need. So I mean,
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:11.760]   I go for higher levels, but I don't just automatically do it. I do it when I feel it.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:18.880]   And I think that is what I try to get across that people feel. And then they don't think they
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:26.240]   don't develop fast enough, or they just need to also be at that level just because the neighbor is
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:34.640]   there or Susan in the telegram group wrote, she's at a whatever level. It doesn't mean that I need
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:42.240]   to do it. It always means I need to just watch out for myself. And if we do that more than we
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:48.480]   don't do anything wrong, because the thing is if we feel and then we act based on what we feel,
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:57.600]   it's always right. We're always right with that. That's what, the mind is just the brain that's
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:04.800]   constantly trying to automatically just go for higher and more or for this or for that.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:12.480]   And that's really all I can say about that. If we just automatically upgrade way too fast and
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.480]   we don't watch out for ourselves and it becomes too much, then we've had that situation in the past
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:25.200]   with someone he had upgraded too much. And then literally his own system couldn't take it anymore,
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:33.280]   his own bio field system, basically. That's what I mean by that. And which includes his physical body,
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:40.480]   couldn't take it anymore. And it literally blocked the block at that point so that the block couldn't even
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:51.120]   create that energy field anymore the way it would under normal circumstances. And then we actually
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:14:00.240]   had to work with him and also fix the block in order to ease that again, right? And that's just
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:06.080]   something I don't want to scare anyone off, right? That usually doesn't happen. That person just
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.520]   went more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more all the time and wasn't paying attention at all
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:20.400]   to where he was at that point, right? And I don't assume that a lot of people do that, right?
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:28.400]   Because we say just be mindful with it and look and check. And if you just take a very balanced
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:34.560]   approach, I think you're always on a good path. Yeah, perfect. Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:40.720]   I mean, when I, my first two original infinity blocks, I stopped at nine. I just, all of a sudden,
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.800]   just felt it was the right place to be. And I just stopped. And then, but I did use the booster
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.520]   capsule. So, you know, when you, when people use their booster capsules on their older IBs,
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:59.200]   does that impart onto the older IBs, all of the features of the new one, or just boost the energy?
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:11.600]   No, so the, the booster capsule adds all the features to the old infinity block. So it's,
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:20.800]   it's in no way inferior to the quote unquote new infinity block that we offered. I think it was
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:28.480]   January, right? Or I don't know. Sometimes this year, the only thing was that the infinity block
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:37.120]   that we started offering was stronger in energy. But if you had, for example, two infinity,
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.800]   regular infinity blocks, and now you use this booster capsule, you had all the features included,
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.080]   and then you could start upgrading them again. And you'd be very quickly at that very same level,
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.280]   right? Okay. Yeah, you know, like you actually, when we talked about that earlier in the year,
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.480]   you, you recommended if you, if you had to, you know, boost them, you know, boost them individually,
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.880]   and not at the same time. And I took that up. And I got to tell you, you know, I boosted the first
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:08.400]   one. I was like, I could feel this entirely different feeling from the block. And, and my
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:14.400]   intuition just was like, this is a lot of energy. And I had, I literally waited, and it took four
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:19.920]   weeks before I felt like I was in tune with the first block. And then I boosted the second one,
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:27.280]   and I bumped up again. And it's just, it was this wild feeling of just having the second one doing,
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.440]   you know, now had two in my house. And that was pretty wild. So yeah, I definitely
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:37.680]   followed your recommendation. And then I felt the reason why. So yeah, that makes a lot of sense
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:44.480]   to me. Thanks for that. No, another question that kind of came up is, you know, is it really great
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:50.080]   question? I didn't know the answer. And I'd, so I just kind of guessed. But the idea of blood
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.560]   testing, and the question came from a member who was getting their, you know, getting their blood
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.520]   tested by their doctor. And the question was was, you know, you know, because of the studies, right,
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.840]   that the quantum energy really, you know, kind of does this incredible, wonderful thing about all
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.480]   the different blood attributes. And it's all, you know, it's all been documented. But the question
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:14.160]   was is, should I be turning off my quantum upgrade if I'm getting my blood tested by my doctor?
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.760]   Because aren't they going to see the good, you know, I mean, aren't they going to see,
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:23.440]   right, this perfect picture of my blood and misdiagnose me? And should I turn everything off
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.240]   wait a week and then go get the blood test so they see the natural me and that way they can
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.960]   diagnose off of that? You know, it was a great question. Right. So the question for you, Philip,
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.680]   is should people turn off all that quantum stuff and wait a while before they get, you know, if
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:43.520]   they're up, if they're scheduled for a blood test, is the doctor going to get a misdiagnosis?
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.200]   Because they're going to see this perfect blood kind of thing. What do you think?
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.480]   No, you don't see a misdiagnosis because if there's something in the blood that you have,
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:59.840]   that's not good, it would show, right? So I mean, I don't, I don't see any pointed. It just,
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:06.640]   you know, you, you, you will have a better situation when you're turned on than when you're
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:13.120]   turned off. But then if you use the quantum upgrade, for example, why would you turn it off,
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:19.440]   right? That I would only do if you wanted to test for yourself some before and after effects,
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:26.880]   for example, and that, you know, obviously you would then you would get tested with a before test
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:35.440]   where you don't use it. But then then you shouldn't have used it for a few weeks. I suggest at least
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:41.360]   and then, you know, do it again. But rather than that, no, I mean, it doesn't mask anything, right?
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:47.680]   It just helps the body to function better. Yeah. Okay. So basically, you know, taking a blood test
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:53.520]   as you are, and if you got quantum in your life, that is how you are. And that, okay,
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.880]   so that makes sense. Because that's what I would, I wouldn't turn it all off. But it was a great
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.200]   question. It wasn't like, Oh, that's a good question. Well, thank you very much for that. That was
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.400]   really an interesting chat with Philip. And I'm, and I hope that you found that interesting as well.
