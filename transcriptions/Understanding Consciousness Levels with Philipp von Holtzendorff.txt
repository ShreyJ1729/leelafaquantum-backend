[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   I've got Philip on the line, everybody, and we're talking about the language here on the website about this new infinity block and the concept behind the, you know, the idea here, I guess, Philip, the best way to say it, is that there's a difference between the Hawkins level.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Right. And the consciousness level of these blocks, and I think the wording is a little, I don't know, it's just, it's kind of like for someone who's first time trying to digest the concept of, you know, they're reading about every different product right every different product you're saying has a, it like it vibrates at this right but then down here, you're talking about okay now when you start upgrading.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   It's stronger than the first, and then it goes from Hawkins levels to quantum consciousness levels.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   This is the same thing. I need to interrupt sorry because yeah it is the absolutely same thing in this wording and on the website currently that is all the same thing because it is the consciousness level on the Hawkins scale that's the
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   way to say it, you know, but then, you know, people, you know, use it as a Hawkins level also and I do that too. So it's interchangeably it is all the same just in the past at some point, maybe two years ago, we actually looked at the actual quantum consciousness
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   levels that the device had now and that's completely different, but we're not talking about this and I hate to bring it up actually right now because then it confuses people again so we completely eliminated all of that from the website because there was no reference point.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And now with the Hawkins scale people really have a reference point even that now gets more difficult because of the 1000 limit on the Hawkins scale or we'll get into that.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   But no, everything on the website right now in terms of consciousness level, Hawkins scale level, it's all the same thing.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   All right, so it's okay so that's that answer there, there's not there's not two different scales right, or are there two different scales.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   No.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Okay, so two different scales one scale.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Okay, so then the second question is, and this has been coming up with people asking about okay well how is it possible to exceed you know let's say I'm just pulled up the scale.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Like all of a sudden now you know you've got Layla products out there that are 1000 more 2000 more than then the very, you know, top level of you know like this is what Hawkins came out with that you know basically like full consciousness was at 1000.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And now all of a sudden there's products out there that are like way higher than 1000 so you know so you had the really great post in the German group that I reposted in the English group but could you kind of explain the idea here of how Layla Q has adopted
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   the Hawkins scale of consciousness as a framework as a benchmark you know conceptual benchmark by which to convey the strength of these products.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Right, but then how are you and how is it possible to go beyond what Hawkins envisioned as the ultimate God level consciousness.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Right, yeah, in his in his writings you're talking about beyond enlightenment beyond the 12th dimension.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   So could you explain like could you explain what you posted in the German group.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I think yes also for people to understand thank you.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I'm glad we're bringing it up and I'm sort of glad also that this person in that group asked.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   You know they basically said, you know we looked at this Hawkins scale and and it says God level basically at 1000 now you're having a product that are higher than that like how can anything be higher than God level.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And so the answer is nothing can be higher than God level, nothing ever can be or will be vibrating higher than God level because it's just simply impossible but.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And at the same time Hawkins is and was an absolutely brilliant man with a brilliant mind and very tuned in with amazing work and we're so glad that he put out this scale.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   But what happened in the meantime you know he's been dead for a while and at the time when he, you know, set all this up he did not foresee that the energy on earth the conscious level on earth and offer.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Which shift so significantly that completely different levels and vibration levels would be possible here on earth for objects to vibrate like that for humans to vibrate like that.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   He for example when he wrote this book and people can read it he would tell people well an average human can only increase their consciousness level by like.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I don't know like it's ridiculously no low number if we're looking at it from today's perspective 12 to 25 points or 20 points or something like that and that would even be a stretch right that may have been the case 20, 25 years ago.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   But it is not at all the case anymore today.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And so now we obviously could have run with the Hawkins scale as is and said okay, we will keep it at the limit of 1000 but it's just not right like we can't do it because it's not right.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Everything is stretching out and is constantly vibrating higher and higher and higher levels are possible so there is no limit anymore up there and, you know, it's, and there really isn't any limit to be honest so it is constantly expanding.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And that is, that is the reason why also our products can can calibrate way higher now they calibrate extremely high so obviously they're still in this, this huge upper zone right if you were to continually upgrade the Hawkins scale basically
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   and say okay so what levels do we see now you know where's sort of like a limit type line you know where where would the products vibrate yeah.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Very, very, very high, but that is pretty much the case and human nowadays you know can upgrade their own consciousness level by vast numbers absolutely vast numbers.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And then I think that that's a pretty good message.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   But really it's, it's, it's outdated the Hawkins scale with the limit of 1000 is all outdated and people that say well yeah but you can't change it.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Like yeah you actually have to change it otherwise you're living a concept or you're sticking to some old concept and that that has never served anyone right because those are just rigid concepts that if they don't apply anymore
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   you need to adjust them and if you keep living by them you're living in the old world and you're not looking at the reality as is and Hawkins I'm certain because of his amazing work and how tuned in he was.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   He would write a pulver's book you know version two now if he was still alive.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   So my end of the post was you know maybe someone will write that and maybe we will have to write it.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And I'm sure that there will be some people out there that are like.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   You know the hardcore Hawkins followers that will be like wow yeah you can't you can't do that you can't you can't be higher than 1000 Hawkins kill guess what yes you can.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Maybe himself I'm pretty certain and you know would say the same thing.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Yeah no that makes sense to me because I've been trying to convey the same concept by posting that you know there's really no numbers numbers don't exist in nature right you've got yes you've got the Fibonacci sequence you've got the golden mean you know you've got these
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   incredible. You know these these things that you know whatever designed the universe right put in some really secret codes in there you got these bio geometry stuff and there's some really interesting sacred stuff in nature.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   But they're not numbers they're just concepts and and I think that if I were to just take all these numbers away I think it would still hold true that there is a path to enlightenment.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   But there's just you can't assign a number to it and if you've done any deep inner work you know people know that there are no numbers to this you just transcend to the next level depending on you and your you know your your life and everything that's going on so.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   So yeah no I think that makes a lot of sense I hope that explains it to everybody.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   I know people are really number oriented I think that's just because our brains right I mean it literally is a human brain thing to try to put structure to everything you're perceiving, especially through your eyes and your ears and you
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   want to structure it and you want to put it into context.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Consciousness isn't isn't that consciousness is a whole other thing and there's no number numerical scale for it so so are you seeing now with the other healers that you know we're entering this this age right where you know it's just every consciousness is expanding and everything is lifting up.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   I think you've mentioned that to me before where you were saying that you know we've kind of just where the planet is in the cosmos and just our vibration you know overall as a species in the planet itself is vibrating I know that even the human residents.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   I don't know if you knew this right but from a biological standpoint the human residence is also changing and it's also going up.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   So the earth is vibrating at a different frequency now you know so I think that's really an amazing thing that you know yeah we're really evolving.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And yeah there's really no there's no limit now the 1000 is not the limit and the limit is infant infinity I think right infinite.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   That is true and it is true because God is infinite and so and and you know God is sometimes the wrong word to use because it's been misused so much in religions or by religions.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   So to me God does mean any of that that has these attachments so you could also say the super consciousness or you know whatever you feel a college is the universe.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   But not certainly not just the physical right it's really the universe of everything.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And that has no beginning and it has no end Italy is infinite.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And that is so hard to understand with the brain because it's such a paradox to everything that has a limit that we experience in this reality but that is really it.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And and to me what it really shows that nails here is that you know we're coming out of the so-called Kali you that a lot of people probably have heard of it's sort of it's this huge age basically of density of you know quote unquote darkness
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   of form getting you know who we really are and and just living in a very dense non transparent non connected world.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   And we're moving into a much lighter and brighter age at the moment and we're moving there and it's accelerating and speed so we are getting connected more and more with our true essence right we.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   We suddenly have these tools available we have there's lots of other things that are happening and really you see the consciousness coming out in a completely different way again.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   And I think when Earth shifted so significantly which was about like probably 10 15 years ago.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   That's where it really started to get boosted and at this point we can only always look every day new and see you know what's new what can we do and and also we are challenged at Lila here you know what these things like when
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   you asked me here ago if we could would launch an infinity block with 3,800 on the Hawkins scale I would probably I would have said no I mean I would probably have said you know never say never but I just don't see it and that sometimes is really the case you don't see it but
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   you're proven wrong. You know you just need to constantly go with the flow. Now we've we've drifted away from the core topic a little bit but I find it important because we all need to do that constantly we need to just look at everything
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   from a fresh perspective in a new way and make sure everything old you know can we allow that to be reevaluated and let go of old concepts and just look at things how there are today and for everyone that's a challenge frankly because we're
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   very comfortable in living in all structures and concepts like everyone is it's it's part of the human I think experience and especially from how we've learned to grow up you know all of us as children you know we've learned concepts and
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   structure and all of that and to break free from that I think is a is a challenge that everyone has and me included
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   you know yeah no me to me to you know I you know so everybody and I know you guys are a lot of you are fixated on numbers but rest assured the framework is there the numbers are no longer quite relevant
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   but I think that's why Hawkins would probably agree and maybe Philip if you ever had the time I would love to read your book the kind of the Von Holtsendorf levels of consciousness part two.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   All right well thank you very much for that answer and so that concludes this little quick video to kind of address that topic so Mahalo. Thanks Philip.
