[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another carbon 60 video by me, Kay Almer, and in
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.640]   this video I would like to share with you my experiments at trying to
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.880]   reconstitute dried pulverized C60. Before we jump into that let's just go for
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.440]   some disclaimers here. This material is for research purposes only. C60 oil is
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.180]   not approved for consumption by the FDA. You understand that making and
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.040]   consuming C60 oil is experimental and you do so at your own risk. We are the
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.940]   human trial as I always like to remind everybody and of course this is not a
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.280]   product endorsement. I do not get paid in any way to make videos so let's jump
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.200]   right in. So what happened here was two of us you remember Jay from the topical
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.640]   video my partner in crime who was doing the experiment with me. Well he and I
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.680]   both had the same situation occur to us where we buy this product called C6
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.440]   pulverized C60 from a company called Red Lion and it comes in alcohol and
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.840]   there's a lot of instructions a really good instructions on the website and
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.960]   one of the major ones is don't let the alcohol dry out and so he had a
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.240]   situation where he had a five gram bottle this is the bottle where he got on a
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.840]   plane and somehow the pressure whatever but all the alcohol just went out of the
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.520]   bottle and all he was left with was powder. I had the same situation myself
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.800]   where I was I had a two gram bottle I had taken out about a gram in a syringe and
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.280]   I was using it topically it was in a box and I keep it all in a dark box and
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.320]   then I went back to go get it about a month later and I opened that bottle and
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.760]   I had the same situation the alcohol was gone and all that was left was a dry
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.840]   powder at the bottom of the jar. So what happens when the alcohol goes away?
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:53.400]   Well the main thing is it the C60 just ends up being like a cakey black powder
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.640]   at the bottom so here's an example this is what it looked like in Jay's bottle
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.000]   basically everything just dried up it's kind of hard to see but you can kind of
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.840]   see here when the light hits it right about there yeah you see that right in
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.960]   there it just dries to the side of the jar it dries up on the bottom and it
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.400]   becomes like this cakey black powder and it's not like the granular powdered
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.240]   60 that you'd buy from SES or MTR or Solaris this turns into some kind of
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:29.000]   like cakey like almost like flour and so at that point you know what do you do
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.840]   because the instructions are clearly do not dry the pulverized C60 in this
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.280]   pulverized they don't rapidly oxidize well shoots now what I mean this stuff
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.920]   costs literally as you know C60 is almost four times the price of gold so he
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.400]   didn't want it to waste and I didn't want to waste mine so he goes ahead and
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.760]   gives me this this bottle Jay gives me this bottle and says hey see what you
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.360]   can do with it so I set out to see what I could do with it my first thought was
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.200]   was well there's two things you can do with C60 let's see what I could do for
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.760]   either one and you can either ingest it right or you could take it topically or
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.360]   use it topically I should say and so I wanted to see what kinds of different
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.360]   liquids or solvents that I could use to try to reconstitute this this remaining
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:24.600]   C60 powder at the bottom of the jar so for ingestion purposes I got organic
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.480]   olive oil and then I got a 160 proof alcohol that I mysteriously received in
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.840]   a mason jar and for topical use I decided I'd try to see if I could
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.320]   reconstitute it with DMSO or magnesium chloride now both of these are are also
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:49.320]   things people put on their skin DMSO is like it's it's a chemical that really
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.560]   accelerates or assists the delivery of almost anything you put in it and it's
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.640]   designed to just suck it right through your skin it's it's really good for that
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.160]   people use that for that purpose magnesium chloride is more of a skin
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.080]   detoxer but these are two things that are are actually good things to use for
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.880]   your skin and something interesting that you might want to blend with C60 so
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.760]   hey whatnot I decided to give it a try see what would happen can I bring back
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.280]   that powder back to its original form and then use it to make C60 oil that was
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.200]   my primary goal so I mixed them all and this is what it looked like in the olive
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.440]   oil it just black DMSO black black black black okay so this was what when I
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.280]   initially just took a tiny scoop mix it up I didn't do a very good job at making
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.680]   sure that the amount of liquid in each test tube was the same but the results
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.840]   were the same it basically was in the solution and the fluids were all black
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.760]   so the first experiment was was successful you are easily able to dissolve
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.640]   the C60 that's remaining in the jar in these four solvents but does that
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.120]   actually do what you needed to do so I let it sit for a week and after one
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.040]   week it started it settled out in in almost all three of them except for the
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.840]   olive oil so this was what was interesting about it was the key to me
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.080]   was if I can use this in order to use this for a C60 olive oil that I wanted
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.440]   to make with with this reconstituted P60 it needed to hold in solution needed
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.800]   to help you know would it stay in solution and sure enough it did in olive
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.160]   oil so that worked really really well and this is what I worked with and then
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.760]   you can see the other three so let me kind of just show you kind of like this
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.520]   is the olive oil after one week you can see where it really there's the like the
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.720]   heavier particulates kind of settled to the bottom but the rest of it which is
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.120]   simply stirring with a stick you know with one of the lab instrument that it
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.480]   really held in the olive oil because this she was like green and with very
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.400]   little stirring it turned into a lipo full arena and it looked really nice so
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:06.240]   the olive oil by far you know is what I highly recommend using to reconstitute
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.360]   if you have any dried PC 60 now this is the oil alcohol what's interesting about
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.120]   the alcohol is that it comes in alcohol but when I mixed alcohol back into the
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.280]   solution it literally just fell right out I mean this was it this the C60 just
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.960]   settled straight to the bottom and it just was absolutely clear and it
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.720]   remained clear no matter how many times I shook this test tube within an hour this
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.080]   is what it would look like so although PC 60 comes in alcohol you cannot use
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.560]   alcohol to reconstitute it so that's something that's really important to
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.640]   note that I wanted to share the second thing was now I'm always interested in
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.800]   using C60 on my skin I do take it topically that's just to break up the
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.440]   routine and so with the DMSO what was interesting about this was I did add it
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:07:00.280]   to the DMSO and the thing is is the first three times I took this thing and I
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.440]   shook it apart and shook it apart and you know and it would it would settle
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.840]   down and and it would remain clear but on the fourth time that I did it which
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.840]   was interesting that would take four times but the fourth time that I shook
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:19.280]   that test tube and then let it settle it actually formed some lipo DMSO I don't
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.440]   know what I don't know what you call it at this point but it dissolved in
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:31.120]   solution and turn the clear DMSO this lovely color here and then the heavier
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.560]   particulate settled to the bottom and so that that's a very interesting finding
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.480]   because I think at this point I could take this and apply it to my skin this
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:47.560]   here the heavier particulates which from the drying out process you know some of
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.800]   the C60 the pulver I see 60 clumped together and formed bigger particulates
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.160]   and some of it remained in a monomolecular state otherwise this
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   wouldn't even happen so what's interesting is the DMSO actually could
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.600]   hold it and so from a topical base standpoint this makes this is a really
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:12.560]   good indication that DMSO is a good additive to C60 for people that want
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.440]   to apply it to your skin you know like the as a I don't know as a solvent or if
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.840]   you don't want to use olive oil or coconut oil anyway so now the fourth try
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.360]   was this was in magnesium chloride and and something really interesting happened
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.560]   here with the magnesium chloride when I mixed the pulverized the dried pulver
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.240]   I see 60 shook it up a bunch times you know let it settle and after a week this
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:42.480]   is what it looks like the heavier particulate settled nothing dissolved and
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:49.560]   then this this head formed and I'm thinking what this is up here it's
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:56.440]   probably the monomolecular particulates of the PC60 and it did something with
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:02.720]   the magnesium chloride where it created this this weird black liquidy stuff I
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:08.800]   think this might be the dissolved C60 and then it's clear and then it's the
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.080]   heavy part so this is really interesting so I'm gonna actually take this part up
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:18.480]   here and see if I could take that topically and see if I'll get a C60
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.240]   reaction from that but I was kind of really surprised that this that this came
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.560]   out this way I didn't expect it to be but you know here's an example of you
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:35.360]   know taking C60 using a topical solvent and here you go this is what happened
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.640]   so this might be a whole new little product line right there don't know but
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.560]   it's interesting I'm gonna work with the topical stuff more later this was more
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:50.200]   so like how do I salvage you know this dried up PC 60 so here's what happens
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:56.840]   next is basically I once I knew that the olive oil was the best one I took the
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.360]   jar I filled it back up with olive oil there's about four grams left in it at
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:06.600]   that point after dinking around with my experiments and so I added olive oil to
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.840]   this and I wanted to see what would happen and this is just the the sorry
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.440]   for the cell phone video but it was kind of like what I had at the time but so I
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:21.120]   added using a syringe I added this is the olive oil piece CC dried PC 60 or
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.800]   reconstituted p60 whatever you want to call it adding it to solution so you can
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:34.480]   just see it behaves almost the same way so it definitely held in the source olive
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.800]   oil poured into olive oil and it kind of acted the same way and if you're
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.040]   familiar with what it looks like I put a stir stir stick in there put it on the
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.240]   stir here I go turn it on and you've seen this before where that where it's
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.880]   just kind of like drifting in there and then boom turn on the stir and this thing
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.520]   just goes and turns chocolate brown so it's it's definitely doing what you
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.000]   would normally do if it was just right out of the you know right out of the
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.200]   shipping container and and in alcohol so in olive oil it does pretty much the
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.840]   same thing and I did do I did two tests because the thing is here because I'm
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.320]   reconstituting it because I don't really know how much C 60 was left in the jar
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.600]   and I'm only working with the the first jar that Jay gave me I did two tests
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.920]   because I wasn't sure what the ratios were right because if you got like a
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.720]   regular jar you know exactly how much alcohol and C 60s in it and you know how
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.520]   many milliliters to pull out and you know your ratios to to make your oil but in
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.800]   this case I reconstituted it so I didn't know what my ratios were so I used did
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.640]   two tests the first test was I took two milliliters of the reconstituted PC 60
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.320]   and I put that in 500 milliliters of olive oil and the second one is I took
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.440]   five milliliters and I put it in another container with 500 milliliters of olive
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.200]   oil just to see you know what the difference would be to see if you know
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   obviously the goal is to make C 60 oil and not waste all that poor dried C 60
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:07.400]   that didn't have a home so the results now were pretty interesting so the very
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:14.800]   first one is this guy and this guy is the one that had two milliliters and I'll
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.400]   take a look at the color this thing it within a day or I mean sorry within about
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.540]   an hour it turned red and it just stayed red and I'm just like stirring it up and
[00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.000]   I'm kind of thinking about just leaving this thing stirring but this is the
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.200]   color and then on this one is the one with the five milliliters and it just
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.000]   stayed that dark chocolate brown that you're all used to when you make the C 60
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:45.200]   oil so in my opinion I guess is that two milliliters was not enough because it's
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.720]   super light purple red whatever over here and five milliliters probably too
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.040]   much so I'm gonna kind of dinker around with it and see what I'm gonna do with
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:13:02.280]   the remaining reconstituted PC 60 as I make more oils but here's the the
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:07.640]   conclusion is that it worked okay it worked so if you accidentally or
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:14.320]   somehow end up with dried pulver I see 60 you can use olive oil and so here's
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.520]   just an example this is what it looked like when I started I added the olive
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.200]   oil shut the crap out of it used it up and look look at this it's just totally
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.680]   clean the olive oil got all of that powder out and it just was a clean jar
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:34.480]   on the inside so I was able to salvage it and I was able to make P 60 oil out of
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:39.040]   it and so the of course the ultimate test is what happens when you take this
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.560]   do you get the same result and and I'll know that and you know it's gonna take
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.840]   a while it takes about a month but a month from now we'll be trying this I'm
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.280]   gonna send a bunch of it to Jay and and the two of us are gonna try it and
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.720]   hopefully it'll be the same thing as regular C 60 olive oil and all of this
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.240]   would not have gone to waste which was the whole point of this experiment and
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.440]   I'm just wanting to share that with you because that's what I did over the last
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:09.320]   week so oh and lastly but surely huge reminder now this comes straight from
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:14.200]   the red lion instructions for pulver I 60 of course everything's in the video
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.680]   descriptions links provided but just a huge reminder that when you open this
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:25.460]   jar okay that it may or may not seal well and and if you don't want to take the
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.360]   risk of having to dink around like I just did and and you know I have to
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.560]   reconstitute it then it's highly recommended you do not leave it in this
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.560]   jar that you either pour the whole thing in oil and use the oil like a mother like
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.240]   you know like sourdough mother but and then you just you know basically have a
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:48.120]   have a jar of oil that's got all the C 60 in it and you just take out just like
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.720]   I'm doing with the with the reconstitute it but you don't have to go
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.260]   through the drying stage which you do not want to let it dry out if you can
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:01.520]   completely avoid it or and this is what I did was I have a 10 gram bottle and so
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.760]   what I do is I store it in syringes so once I open this bottle I give it a good
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.680]   shake and then I just have all my syringes ready to go these are all 10
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.920]   milliliters syringes with a three inch blunt needle and I just I just extract
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.640]   all of it in there's 10 milliliters in each one and if you know if you buy a
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:25.640]   10 gram bottle of red line pulver I see 60 it'll contain approximately 69
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.400]   milliliters of fluid it's a different ratio than the smaller jars and that's
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.680]   in the instructions by the way and then if you store it like this like yeah the
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.000]   instruction say put it in a syringe and stick the needle into like a like a
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.400]   blunt thing where the lead the the needle will be closed off from air these
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.720]   needles come with a little cover they come with a little container and it
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.680]   snaps right on to the the bottom of the syringe so this is airtight and I keep
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:57.800]   all of my P660 I don't I don't even in the jar now after I learned about you
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.720]   know this this taught me a lesson so I took it all out I keep it in syringes and
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.840]   I just keep the syringes in a mylar bag sealed up inside of my dark box cool
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:12.360]   dry do not let this be exposed to air do not let it be exposed to light as much
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.280]   as possible I'll keep it dry and cool and you won't have any problems with your
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.560]   pulver I see 60 so that's what I learned and I wanted to share it with you
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:27.000]   because it was kind of interesting lots to lots to tons lots to learn and again
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.920]   just say thank you guys yeah I know you've got a really busy day and thanks for
