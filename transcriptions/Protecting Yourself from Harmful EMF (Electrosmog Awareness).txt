[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Aloha, and welcome to another video by me, Kay Elmer, and this video is a response video.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.440]   It's a quick and dirty, not a normal video by me video.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.920]   In response to a friend of mine who recently had a baby, and he was asking me what I have
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:25.040]   done about protecting myself, my child, my family from the negative effects of EMF, which
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.280]   is also known as electro smog.
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.480]   So I was putting together some, it's easier to show him than it is to try to type it out
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.640]   in a form, or so forth.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.080]   So I put together this video to share with him, to just show him, hey, this is what I've
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.640]   done in my own home, and the reasons why, and how to approach it.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.440]   And then as I was putting it together, I really thought, wow, you know, I probably more than
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.680]   just his family is interested in just understanding what to do, because it's one thing to have
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.120]   people go, oh, you know, EMF is really bad for you.
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.000]   Here's why, but it's another whole thing to go, okay, what do you do about it?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.360]   And so here's one man's approach towards protecting myself and my family from EMF.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.800]   It's just a quick and dirty.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.320]   I don't get into the details, everything I'm saying, feel free, just go ahead and use
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.800]   your duck duck go, and go and look up the details if you want to know more about all
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.800]   of the topics.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.580]   I'm just going to go and do a how-to video.
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.600]   This is just going to be very simple, apologizing in advance.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.480]   It's very informal, not a lot of slides, but I do want to get into a little bit of introductory.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.920]   So just right off the bat, for people who are not familiar with the term electro smog,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.440]   think about it 200 years ago, right, or 100 years ago before electricity.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.640]   People lived in a world where there wasn't any radio frequencies, airport radars, satellite,
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.040]   beaming stuff down into your brain.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.160]   I mean, there was nothing around you from an electrical standpoint, except one thing.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.160]   And that was all two things, cosmic energy from spacers, wavelengths from space.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.040]   And then there's also the Earth's own resonance frequency, which is called the human resonance.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.080]   And so, you know, we've lived for eons, literally as eons and eons of time, the human race has
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.600]   lived in nature, right, and has only been subjected to the wavelengths and the electricity
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.320]   of nature.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.200]   And then just in the last 100 years, we have been subjected to every possible thing that
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.120]   they could invent, whether it's Wi-Fi or cell phones or satellites or microwaves, or you
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.120]   name it.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.680]   It is just an unbelievable amount of onslaught of electrical pollution, of magnetic pollution,
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.000]   and frequency pollution.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.880]   And we're not compatible with that as living organisms, and I'll show you why.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.880]   And so, there's a coined phrase now for all of that, just smog.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.560]   It's a smog of electrical stuff that's just invisible around us, and we live in it every
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.920]   day for you in the country.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.640]   Hey, you know, good for you, really.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.080]   If I could move out of here, I would.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.920]   I live in the city, as you're going to see in the video, and then I have the problems
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.320]   that you have when you live in the city.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.320]   I live in a building, which is even worse than living in a city.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.400]   So I just, this is to my buddy Jay, you know, so just, you know, here's to show you what
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.360]   I have done, and I just explain a little bit further.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.720]   This is why you should be worried.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.760]   This is why people are worried about it, because normal electrical frequencies are in
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.960]   the natural, like 1 hertz to 10 hertz.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.080]   This is natural.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.480]   This is normal humans.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.320]   We've been on the planet for millennia.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.860]   You know, this is where we live, and you can see by the wavelength, there's almost no
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.860]   wavelength.
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.820]   As energy passes through us, as biological beams, it's not disruptive to us.
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.020]   But the higher the frequency, the more amplitude or the more of the closer of the wavelength
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.020]   get.
[00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.820]   And this is actually, if you were to put it on an oscilloscope, you would see the wavelengths.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.700]   Until you get into this level of energy coming in, and it's just rapidly going up and down.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.540]   And that is like how our microwave works.
[00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.140]   We all know how microwaves work, right?
[00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.260]   You put anything in there with liquid, and it's going to excite the molecules of the
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.740]   liquid, and it's going to cause heat.
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.260]   Well guess what a cell phone tower does to your brain, which is made out of liquid, right?
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.860]   So this is why it's so dangerous, and the higher you get up here, the worse it is in
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.860]   terms of frequency.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.980]   And you know, when there are, everyone's talking about 5G, a couple of years ago, everybody's
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.660]   talking about smart meters.
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.420]   And that's the world right here that it lives in.
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.260]   Those things live in this world.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.840]   X-rays, gamma rays, all these kinds of things are in the high-end frequency range of things
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.260]   that are very harmful.
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.100]   And the reasons is I'm going to just, you know, Google it as much as you want about this.
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.100]   It's all out there.
[00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.300]   There's so much, so much data about this.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.900]   So I don't have to go into it, but bottom line, this is what happens.
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.860]   When you live in concert with nature, okay, you have, it's all producing negative ions.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.660]   That's why people feel so good when they go to the beach or in a rainstorm where there's
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.660]   lightning.
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.660]   You breathe that fresh air.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.460]   Well, it's causing negative ions.
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.260]   Negative is electrons.
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.080]   You know, we're good on electrons, what we're not good on is positive ions.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.360]   And so when you're living in a natural, you know, when you're living in symbiotic with
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.680]   nature, you're getting a lot of really good negative ions.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.080]   It's good for your body.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.800]   And you have these, and you're in your blood cells and your cellular system, all of it.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.720]   It's just harmonizing and running at peak optimal performance.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.640]   But then when you have are exposed to positive ions, which are generated by everything from
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.420]   cell phones to smoke to Wi-Fi to car exhausts to satellites to, you know, there's all that
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:40.440]   stuff, then what happens is it literally will damage our blood cells and our cellular system.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.360]   So at the, at the literal cellular level, we are being damaged and it's causing oxidative
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.280]   stress and all these other things.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.840]   It bottom line is not good for us.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.920]   It's really bad for us.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.200]   And then what's even worse is if it's happening to you while you're sleeping because if you're
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.600]   sleeping, that's the only time your body's actually truly regenerating, right?
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.920]   We regenerate constantly.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.680]   We're always shedding off old us and creating new us, whether it's your hair, your brain,
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   whatever.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.680]   We're always replicating.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.680]   Our cells are replicating.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.600]   We're constantly replenishing ourselves through regeneration.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.280]   That's our natural way to just kind of, you know, you know, that's how we exist.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.120]   And then especially for children, especially not only do children regenerate at night.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.120]   That's when they grow.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.980]   And so if you've ever seen a child that's been, you know, basically deprived of sleep, they'll
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:32.980]   be stunted.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.980]   And I've seen that.
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.240]   So it's just bizarre, you know, how it affects children.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.520]   It's so much worse for children.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.480]   In fact, one of the absolute worst ideas on the entire planet are baby monitors.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.240]   I cannot believe that anyone would just like put a Wi-Fi, you know, antenna right next
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.560]   to the baby's head and just miles of just, you know, yeah, it's bad.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.800]   So you know, it's just, I can't emphasize it enough.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   So enough of that.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   So anyway, this video.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.080]   Jay, this is what I've done for myself.
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.080]   Okay.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.080]   So I'm going to go ahead and just play the video.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.400]   I want to say thank you for watching, but Jay, this is what I've done.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.120]   And I'm going to focus on four specific things that have affected myself and my family.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.400]   And that is the fact that, you know, their cell phone towers, microwave towers, airport
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.400]   is real nearby me.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.760]   So you've got the radar.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.760]   And so radio frequency is a major issue where I live.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.080]   And so I, you know, I'm going to show you how I dealt with that electrical fields.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.760]   I, you know, anyone who lives in a home, you know, if you live in a house, you know,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.000]   there's, there's wiring and what's that wiring creating electrical fields, appliances, anything
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.320]   that plugs into electricity will create an electrical field.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   All right.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.840]   So those things are also not good for you.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.840]   Magnetic fields.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.600]   You'll see where there's magnetic fields in your house and you'll also see and understand
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.200]   the concept of dirty electricity.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.720]   So those are the four things.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.040]   I mean, I've done a lot more than just these four things, but these are the four, you know,
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.040]   like main things.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.480]   And if you just want to have a place to start, this is where you start.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.800]   And then after, you know, so once we get into that, but then I just want to say to everybody,
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.960]   if you're, if you're going to take this seriously, then you need to first measure and you'll
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.680]   see me measuring, you measure how bad it is and depending on where you live, it might
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.360]   not be bad, but you need to measure it first.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.960]   And then you need to respond accordingly to the measurements, right?
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.200]   That way you don't go crazy.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.560]   You don't, you know, it's, you need to know what you're dealing with.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.720]   That's what I'm trying to emphasize.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.320]   So when you're dealing with EMF, your first thing you really need to understand is how
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.960]   bad is it where you live, where you sleep, where you, you know, okay?
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.600]   And then once you can measure it, then you know what to do with it.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.600]   Okay.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.120]   And I also want to say this is not a commercial for lessemf.com, but that's where I buy all
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.120]   my stuff.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:42.360]   It seems, it is like the superstore for people who are taking EMF shielding seriously.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.240]   And that's just happened to be, and I've been their customer for over 10 years.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.560]   I've been doing this quite a long time.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.240]   So anyway, enough with that.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.400]   I just want to say thank you for watching.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:56.240]   And here's a video and you know what, hey, just everybody, I hope that you'll find this
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.080]   as helpful as, you know, this is for Jay, but I'm hoping this is why I'm putting it out
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.920]   there into the world, that I'm hoping that it might help other people.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.520]   So I hope it does.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.280]   Thank you for watching and hey, have a great week.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.280]   All right.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.280]   Aloha.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.280]   Okay.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.280]   Jay, this is going to be a little clumsy.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.880]   I'm just going to just bang this out real quick, this meaning video.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:23.240]   What I want to show you is that building right there.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:28.360]   And you see that, wow, that's really good for zoom.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.680]   I didn't know my camera could zoom that well.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.520]   Yeah, they put those in like right there.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.520]   You see those?
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.960]   Yeah, they put those in after I moved in.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.160]   That's lovely, isn't it?
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.760]   The other buildings don't have them.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:48.440]   So they picked the tallest one and they put in microwave or cellphone antennas about maybe
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.440]   10 years ago.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.720]   And at the time, you know, it was no problem at all, but you know, obviously when they
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   put those in.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.840]   So I immediately felt a difference.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.840]   It really was weird.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.840]   I just, I couldn't sleep well.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.360]   And then all of a sudden I realized what they'd done.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.600]   So I went ahead and shielded this part of the, I live in a condominium.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:13.400]   So I shielded this entire south facing wall that faces that building at the time and
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.400]   I'll show you the difference.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.540]   So how you, or how I went about going about it is I went to, I went to at less EMF and
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.680]   I bought this electro-spog meter and it's just the one that they recommended and I want
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:30.080]   to show you something is that it's measuring the RF that's coming out, that's coming to
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.880]   the wall here.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.280]   And so it really, it's kind of, it's so simple.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.960]   It's just green, yellow, red, and obviously anything over green is not good for you.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.400]   Now there have been times when I've been out here and you can see the thing spike to
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   red.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.280]   But right now I'm not, you know, it just seems to me just in the yellow, just a few minutes
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.120]   ago I was out here and it was spiking into the yellow.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.720]   You can see a little bit of the yellow where it's just getting into the high range.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.880]   But so right now it's actually not too bad, which was really weird because when I first
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.800]   started really doing this it was spiking to red, but what I want to point out though,
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.240]   you can see it's a solid yellow right now and you can see that it spikes up.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.880]   That's the one thing I didn't realize about cell phone antennas is that they pulse.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.360]   They don't just continually broadcast or they're a pulse.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:21.040]   So taking into the house now and I want to show you the difference.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:29.680]   Okay, so now I'm inside the house and what I did was, and you can see where it is solid
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.680]   green.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.720]   There's no spiking to yellow.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.000]   It is staying in the green and no matter where I move it stays that way because what
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.120]   I want to show is that right here you can see it's unfortunate that my windows are two
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:53.200]   inches longer or wider I guess than the RF shielding window film at Lesi MF cells.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   So I just did a crappy, you know, just get it up there because I needed to shield.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:05.320]   So I do have two inches right there, one on each side where there's no film on the glass.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:10.840]   But just having one, I bought one large roll and I did the entire back up here.
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.600]   This is like one big window right, so like a one eye window.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:20.280]   So this entire window is shielded and then you can see from just that shielding, I dropped
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.520]   it to safe mode.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:28.360]   And then so in my bedroom, which is just forgive the mess, it's just horrible right now.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:33.240]   What I did was, is because the bed is right here and this is where the dogs and I sleep
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.280]   and it's again, sorry for the mess.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:41.920]   What I did was was I had initially, it initially was a lot higher.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:48.360]   I mean, but you can see where it's all green, but when I first did this a few years ago,
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.480]   this thing was spiking yellow and then all the way over to the corner here, it was spiking
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.480]   red.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.160]   But you can see where it's really, really, really, you can see where all that yellow
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.460]   and all those pulses, they're completely shielded out.
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:04.440]   And this gray crap here is another form of shielding.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.720]   It's actually, I liked it, I bought that one because it was, it's adhesive on one side.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.220]   It's like a wallpaper, adhesive wallpaper.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.160]   So the way I measured it out was I just basically figured out like where's my head, you know,
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.720]   my whole body, where the dogs sleep, you know.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.680]   And so I put it right there because that's in line, if you like, if I were to line up
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.960]   the camera, I'm pointing directly at the microwave towers right now.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.440]   And so I just kind of like, it's like a shadow, right?
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.160]   So basically you want to get behind the shadow.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.200]   And so that's what I did, that's how, that way when I'm sleeping or in the bed, when
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:42.400]   we're all in bed, you know, we're behind the shadow of this film, of this, this is nickel
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.840]   plated or nickel coated adhesive film that's RF, it's a radio frequency shielding.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.360]   And then the windows themselves, the bedroom windows themselves also have the window film,
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.600]   it's an RF window film.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:59.920]   And so that's how I shielded the south facing wall against microwave antenna energy or,
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:07.320]   you know, cell phone RF, electro smog, electro, you know, death, whatever, I just don't, you
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.360]   just bottom line, you just don't want to sleep in a microwave field, okay.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.000]   So that's part one.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.360]   Okay, the next couple of things that you need to think about, especially where your baby
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:23.320]   sleeps is not only is there RF frequencies, bad frequencies coming through and you want
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:29.640]   to shield the room for where the baby sleeps and any time the baby spends any place long.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.480]   There's also another meter that you can get, and I got this off of Amazon, it's called
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.320]   the tri-filled meter.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:41.040]   And what this puppy does is it measures electrical fields and it measures magnetic fields.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.840]   And so you can send this, moving those, moving those, the battery test there.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:52.440]   And then so if I set it to magnetic field and I'm measuring the magnetic field around
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:59.600]   where I sleep or where the baby would sleep and both peaches and my bed are not, you know,
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.680]   there's no magnetic field here as an example.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.640]   Same thing, there's a double setting so you can test two different strengths of magnetic
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.800]   field.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.120]   And then right here is an electric field and I want to point out something that's, you
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.240]   know, you hear all the folks that talk about EMF and they're saying, well, don't have
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:20.160]   your phone charging next to your bed where you sleep, you know, keep electronic appliances
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.520]   away from you like electronic clocks and, you know, that's accurate.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.400]   And also too, just want to point out that on the other side of that, that stuffed dog
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:32.000]   toy is an electrical outlet that I've covered with that nickel plating stuff.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.840]   So you want to be real careful about your electrical outlets because let me show you
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.280]   what happens if your baby's too close to the electrical outlet.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.920]   You see this is where I charge my iPad and you can see right there, I just put it there
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:46.600]   for an example, but boom, you can see that that's, there's an electrical field right
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.560]   here next to my head.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.560]   Not good, right?
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.840]   So this thing doesn't sit there all the time.
[00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.200]   It just, I'm just there, for example.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.400]   But the reason it's coming in is it, you see the electrical outlet right there.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.400]   Look how high that is.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:04.720]   And so if that thing is anywhere near your babe or you, it's your basically cooking your
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.720]   brains in an electrical field while you sleep, which is the absolute worst time in the world
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.160]   for a child because that's when they regen, well that's when they grow and that's when
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.160]   they, that's when we regenerate.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.600]   So you got to watch out.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:22.440]   So I, I basically, what I do is I basically have this guy tucked up under in here.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.760]   Let me show you the difference here.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.080]   So I charge this guy, I put him over here at night, right?
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.920]   And then look what happens to the electrical field.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:33.920]   There is none.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.920]   You see the difference?
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.520]   See what an iPad could do?
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.360]   Just an iPad sitting there charging.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.600]   And then if I move over here on the other side of this concrete brick, right?
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.600]   So you can see why there's a brick there.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.600]   It's also my, my Mickey Mouse shelf.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:54.800]   Anyway, so electrical fields, big deal, power outlets, anything that's charging.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.880]   You may even, I don't even know if you notice, but I do not have, you know, okay.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:07.180]   So now I'm in the front of my condo and here's the front door and here's the absolute idiotic
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.180]   place.
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.460]   And I, and I don't blame them.
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.640]   You know, these guys don't know what to do, but, and when it comes to EMF, but this is
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.360]   where they put the circuit breaker box.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.360]   Okay.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.360]   It's right here.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.000]   And guess where my daughter's room or the second bedroom in the units right here next
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.020]   to the front door and this stupid box is right there.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.360]   So here's the thing, I didn't know this because when I had, when, when my daughter was little,
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.680]   I didn't know this and her bed used to be close to this thing, but luckily she was little
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.160]   at the time and refused to sleep alone.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.860]   So the bed was there, but thank gosh, you never actually slept in the freaking thing.
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.660]   But as she got older, I figured it out.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.940]   This is her, she's off to college, so I use it for storage, but this is her bedroom.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:53.580]   And I want to show you now, I've got the tri-felt and then this is the other side of the wall.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.740]   Okay.
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.580]   And this is where the other side of the breaker box.
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.840]   So check this out.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.780]   This is the magnetic field coming off of, I set the tri-felt to magnetic field and I
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.560]   just want to show you the strength of the field.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.080]   This is the entire field behind the circuit box.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:18.380]   Now think about it this way, if your kid, if your child's bed or your bed was anywhere
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.620]   near this thing, and this goes the same for smart meters, okay?
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:25.460]   From an RF standpoint, but this is magnetic now.
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.220]   And then if your head would have been about, maybe like what about it, foot away from the,
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.860]   if this was the head, you know, the headboard was there and her head would be in a magnetic
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:37.460]   field the whole time your baby would be in a magnetic field and that's really bad because
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:42.540]   we are electric beings and you do not want to sleep in an electric field or a magnetic
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.540]   field.
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.740]   So that's the magnetic field right now and that's the pulsing electricity causing an
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.860]   electromagnetic effect in the wiring behind this wall.
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:52.860]   And that's really bad.
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:59.180]   So now if I walk away, if I step away from the circuit breaker wall, you can see where,
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.780]   I positioned her bed now, or this is where her toddler bed was and then she's all grown
[00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.780]   up now.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:09.120]   But this is where her bed is now and you can see where there's just no magnetic field.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.180]   And then the same thing goes for electric, I'm going to switch the trifelt to an electrical
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.780]   field that's set to an electrical field now.
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:26.460]   And you can see the electrical box is shielded and there's an electrical field here, right?
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.900]   Which is just amazing to me.
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:28.900]   But that's the thing, right?
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.940]   I'm now looking for electric fields.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.740]   And now there's no electrical field here because, you know, they thought about electricity,
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.820]   but they didn't think about a magnetic field.
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.140]   And there's your number third thing to worry about.
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:47.340]   And that's magnetic fields and making sure your baby's not exposed to a magnetic field.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.180]   And then we're going to number four.
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.540]   Okay, I'm in my daughter's room still.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:57.220]   And now I want to show you the fourth thing to worry about as if new parents don't have
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.700]   enough to worry about.
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:03.220]   And that is what is called in the EMF world dirty electricity.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:08.060]   And what that means is, is if you remember anything from science class, electricity is
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:12.100]   a flow of electrons through wires and that wires then carries by an amplitude.
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:18.500]   The amplitude translates to frequency and it's supposed to run at around 60 Hertz, okay?
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.380]   And the reason that it's that, I don't even remember, sorry, I don't remember why it's
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.380]   supposed to be 60.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:27.740]   And I do know that the health threshold, if you think about frequency, because you got
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:32.860]   more than just fields, you've got frequency, is that this, you know, like everybody talks
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.660]   about the human residence and it depends on who you talk to.
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.220]   It could be anywhere from 7.83 up to 10 and so forth.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.980]   But there's this natural frequency of the earth.
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:46.300]   And then other frequencies are healing frequencies like 10 and even 40.
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:50.980]   But you know, when you get past 50 is very, very unhealthy and then they've done lots
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.260]   of studies and I'll just leave it there.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:59.900]   So the idea though, is that inside of a house, you are, if you are basically inside a bunch
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.240]   of wiring, right, there's wires all around you.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:08.800]   And so not only do those wires create electrical fields and magnetic fields, those wires also
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.260]   carry a frequency.
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.780]   Now the frequencies are going to permeate the area that they're in.
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.500]   And so if you're sitting in the middle of a room and the room has got wires all around
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.240]   it, then you're in that frequency or you're going to be subjected to the frequency.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:28.200]   So this is another meter also sold by LECEMF and it's called a Steitzer.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.700]   And so the Steitzer has meters, a meter to measure dirty electricity or the frequency
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.340]   in your electrical circuits of your home.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:40.620]   And then they've got filters to filter it down if it's too high.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:45.220]   So these are all unplugged right now because no one's sleeping in here, right, kids away.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.700]   So now I'm going to show you how high it is.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.260]   Now remember now, 60 is what it should be.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:55.500]   Anything over 50, you know, hour 60, I'm just saying, anything over 60 is just too freaking
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.500]   high.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.740]   And it's not healthy for you.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.740]   Definitely not healthy if you're a baby.
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:06.480]   Okay, so right now I've got a 60, okay, now it's just picking up and letting the electricity
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.480]   is.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.580]   Okay, when I first did this, this is really strange.
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.340]   I've got to admit, I haven't done this for a few years because I did all of this project
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.260]   a long time ago.
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.220]   And I shielded the house and put in filters.
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:23.940]   Oh, by the way, there's numerous of these things plugged in all around the house.
[00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:30.220]   But okay, so now let's just say, when I first did this, this thing registered over a thousand.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.940]   It freaked me out and that's why there was three for this room, but I haven't done this
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.940]   for a long time.
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.100]   So this is really fascinating.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.660]   Okay, so now I guess all the other ones I have in the rest of the house, because I started
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:45.420]   in the bedroom here first, is measuring a little bit above normal, okay?
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.780]   So it shouldn't be this high, but this is actually not bad compared to how it was before.
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:54.300]   So it's definitely something to think about because, you know, just Google dirty electricity.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.540]   Okay, but the whole idea though, is you measure it again, you have to measure it.
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.100]   And then if it's too high, like in this case, it is too high.
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.740]   I don't want it to be that high, then all you got to do is you take in, you take one of
[00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:12.460]   the stetzer filters, and then you would just go ahead and plug it in to, and not hopefully,
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.740]   and the minute I plugged in the filter, you could see it dropped.
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:19.660]   And you can just plug in as many filters as you want to get it down to what I would, for
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.500]   me, it's get it below 60.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.860]   So before I plugged that puppy in, you saw it, it was like 60, 70, it got up to 90.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.580]   And now with one filter in there, what happens is, is you know, electricity is a circuit,
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.580]   right?
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.140]   It goes into the filter, the filter then brings the frequency down, and then the meter now
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.940]   shows that it's at a healthy range.
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:41.460]   So it only took one meter, I'm sorry, one filter to bring it down this time.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:47.580]   So two things I just realized is I need to check more often, I don't need three filters
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.780]   anymore, so there should be, you know, do an update every now and then, but also that
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.860]   it is still a little high, and then she's coming home for the holidays.
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.660]   Oh, see, look, it just spiked up.
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.580]   So it's taking a spike right now, which means go add another filter.
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.780]   So let's take this one, okay, I'm going to have to unplug this guy.
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.780]   Hold on.
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:14.300]   Okay, while I was filming this, the thing spiked up to 90, and it's messing with my video.
[00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:23.760]   So I add one, it drops it to the 70 range, and then I'm going to add another one, and
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:28.820]   I barely think I can get to 60, whoop, it took a spike there right when I plugged it
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:29.820]   in.
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:33.580]   Now, now it needs two filters to drop it down to 60 ish.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:37.940]   Yeah, and then if I added a third, which I can't because I'm out of ports, it would
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.340]   drop it down to 50.
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.900]   Yep, there you go.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.860]   So that's the concept, okay, I got to mess around with this thing, but that's the general
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:48.580]   concept of Steitzer filters, is that you bring down the frequency of the electrical frequency
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.260]   in the wiring down to a safer limit, which is 60 or below.
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.340]   All right, that's that for that.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:25:00.540]   So we're back in my room now, and I'm freaking out because my room is registering 500, something
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:06.020]   Hertz, instead of 60, 500.
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:12.700]   You know, when I said I should be doing this more often, yeah, a whole crap.
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.460]   I just, yeah, I'm surprised.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.260]   I did this once, shielded everything, and then I put my meters away until you asked
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:23.980]   me to, what do I do, and now I'm freaking out because I'm like, oh wow, I should have
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.980]   done this a lot sooner because now, and this is what's really bizarre, okay, it used to
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:32.060]   be super high on the other side of the house and low over here, and I do have two filters
[00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:36.500]   plugged into the house, I'm in, on this side of the house, but now it looks like the other
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.420]   side of the house is normal and it's super high over here, and I don't know what would
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.420]   cause that.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.620]   I'm gonna have to look into it, but I'm thinking people's, people plugging in stuff, like on
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:49.420]   the other side of this wall is someone else's bedroom, so yeah, wow, okay, so I'm gonna be
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.620]   plugging in a bunch of Steitzer filters and see if I can get this number down.
[00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:58.620]   This is, this is way too high, this is where I sleep, damn, okay, okay, I needed two hands
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:04.180]   to do that, and I plugged in one Steitzer filter into the outlet here, and look, damn,
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:10.860]   boom, straight down to 26, 28, yeah, so only, it only took one filter, it dropped it from
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:16.100]   500 as you just, this is all, you know, from showing you as it goes, and now it's down to
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:21.620]   a safe level, so, so this is a real wake-up call for me, it means I need to measure every
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:27.140]   now and then, instead of just once, and I need to be checking these things, and yeah, that
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.700]   could explain the reason why I was having trouble sleeping all this time, crap, anyway,
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:36.540]   so I got it to a safe level, which is a good news, and you can see we're just one, just
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:43.540]   one, brought it down, from 500 to 25, so there you go, so those are the four things that you
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.540]   really need to think about, especially if you have a baby, and then you know, just for
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:53.420]   your own general health, but you know, it's RF, radio frequencies, cell phones, 5G, smart
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:58.860]   meters, that's nasty, nasty, nasty stuff, you need to shield for that, for magnetics,
[00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:04.340]   you need to shield for it, electrical currents, or electricity fields, you need to move stuff
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:08.620]   away, or you can shield from that as well, it's very difficult to try to shield from
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.220]   magnetic fields, by the way, so don't even bother, just stay away from them, because
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:17.380]   they're stationary, electrical fields can be, you know, moved around by just moving the
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:23.860]   outlets and things and blocking the outlets on the walls, and then the last part is the
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:27.780]   dirty electricity in your home, and as I just showed, you can use stets or filters and bring
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.600]   that puppy down as well, so I hope this helps you, you know, good health to you and your
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:37.020]   new baby, congratulations on the new baby, and hey man, take care of yourselves, aloha.
