[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another tinker's academy video
[00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.720]   I'm your host calmer and this video is a tutorial on how to use the new Layla Super capsule now
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.920]   This is a limited edition new product that's on the website
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.360]   And we're getting a lot of questions about how to use it from new members
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.160]   So I thought I'd go ahead and put together a tutorial for you to kind of help you understand what it is and how to use it
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.840]   The first thing I want to do though
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.200]   It's really kind of just level set for those of you who are new to Layla products and exactly what a capsule is in
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.160]   In terms of a quantum energy device. So just kind of a little diagram here then over here on the left
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.780]   I'll basically is your blank capsule without any spheres
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.280]   Which is pretty much equal to the strength of one of the cards
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.660]   And so now if you take a look at the concept of strength, you know, like how much quantum energy is in a particular object
[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.000]   You can just simply just go by how big the field is, you know, so if you know, it's a tiny field
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   It's kind of a low strength. It's a really big field. It's a really strong strength, you know, that sort of concept
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.680]   So just kind of give you an idea that an empty capsule is pretty much the same as a as a card that you will find there on the website
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.460]   And so the field is about four inches about ten centimeters
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.000]   So, you know, when you're using these types of things, you know, if using a card or the blank capsule
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.680]   You know, you want to keep it close to your body in other words because the field is only four inches now
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.840]   The spheres themselves are quite powerful and then the idea of the spheres now because it's a sphere
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.240]   It radiates energy out in 360 degrees, and so it has its own little bubble around it that creates a field around the around the sphere
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.160]   I don't actually know I've never it's never been actually reported how big the field is of one single sphere
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.280]   So I'm sorry. I can't provide that information
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.800]   However, I do know that when you take all five of the spheres that come with the capsule and you put them inside the capsule
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.960]   Then it's gonna radiate out in 360 degrees all around it and form it like an energy bubble or an energy field and all air
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.120]   You know all around it and that field size is six feet
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.640]   So it's gonna radiate out, you know three feet from you if you're wearing it in any direction
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.600]   And that's gonna be the field that the quantum energy is in and then when the concept of frequency comes into play
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.440]   Now, I've only just mentioned pure just quantum natural energy
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.000]   But if you add a frequency to it in the form of embedding that frequency into the actual capsule itself or using a foil
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.360]   A piece of foil, which I'll show you how to do in a minute here. If you put a foil inside there or you embed frequency into the capsule itself
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.800]   Then what happens is that all of that energy all those little spheres are gonna just radiate out broadcast emit energy out
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.320]   And 360 degrees and it's gonna just basically broadcast that frequency into that field
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.960]   And that's how you combine the idea of a quantum energy device with frequency and they they go together quite well
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.080]   And that's so that's really kind of how it works from a from a technical standpoint
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.320]   And that's what's happening there. So now the idea of what the lay like what capsules are
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.640]   Out there on the on the product site up until now
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.600]   There's basically been three capsules that have been available for purchase
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.320]   And the most famous one is the heel capsule and that's basically got it's just a capsule
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.480]   That's got the heel frequency embedded in the actual shell of the capsule the again the
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.760]   Spheres act like little you know power generators acute quantum energy generators
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.680]   And so this the capsule itself has been embedded with the sphere frequent
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.160]   I'm sorry
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.720]   The heel frequency and then for the men's booster or the woman's booster same thing
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.760]   It's a capsule with the actual frequency embedded in the capsule itself
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.160]   And it comes with five little spheres that act as the basically the power generators for all that quantum energy
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.000]   So now there is a limited edition product right now for salesman sale on sale for a few months now
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.680]   This is the February 7th, 2023 and now it's called the super capsule and with the super capsule
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.400]   It's different and this is what's really important about this capsule is that it's only neutral quantum energy
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.360]   There's no frequency embedded in the capsule. Okay, so when you when you add the five purple spheres to it
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.400]   You basically have a neutral quantum energy capsule. That's gonna broadcast out in that six feet
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.600]   Six feet wide field and it's just pure energy. Okay, and another thing about it, too
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.000]   It's the most powerful capsule ever been provided, you know for sale
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.720]   So it's way more powerful than any of the other three capsules in terms of its level of quantum energy
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.720]   The six feet field still kind of stands in play. It hasn't been evaluated to see how much bigger that field is
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.520]   But I'm gonna you know, I'm guessing that it is gonna be bigger because it's much stronger
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.000]   But let's just stick with the six feet for the sake of discussion here
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.360]   So if you have any when you buy that thing, you know from the website, you're gonna get the five spheres
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.320]   And then you put the five spheres in of it
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.680]   And you're just gonna have a quantum energy capsule all it's gonna be pure quantum energy
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.840]   And by the way for those of you asking, you know, what are the benefits of just pure quantum energy?
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.160]   Well, if you go to the research site on the website all of those studies
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.960]   Almost all of them are based on actual just just regular quantum energy either through a block
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.320]   And so forth and and so the benefits are anywhere from EMF mitigation ATP production improvement in live blood
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.960]   You know all of those kinds of things that have been proven through third-party independent studies are based on just quantum energy
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.880]   So just wearing this thing would just quantum energy is quite a powerful thing and a very high benefit
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:21.920]   For your well-being now the thing about the super capsule aside from it being a neutral energy capsule with just the five spheres and
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.920]   No frequency in the capsule
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.520]   There comes it comes with a little silver sphere
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.800]   That's and this sphere is different. It's unique
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.120]   It's not like any other sphere because this sphere has been embedded with a frequency now. No other squares fears
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:45.960]   No other spheres have you know, actually have had any frequency. They're all neutral except this one little silver sphere that Leila cells now
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.680]   Which has been embedded with a frequency?
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:55.520]   So if you want to actually then take this capsule, that's just you know energy and you want to add a frequency to it
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.680]   Well, the easiest way is that it comes with the inner piece frequency
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.600]   You just swap it out for one of the purple ones put five in one silver four purple
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.240]   You put it in there and now instead of having a neutral energy capsule
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.680]   You now have a inner piece capsule, right?
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.400]   So it's going to radiate out that frequency along with all the other energy of the sphere
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.040]   So now you can have two different kinds of capsules just right out of the gate and the other thing that's really cool
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.800]   I'm going to show you today is how do you actually then make this capsule be
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.640]   You know be able to carry any frequency. Okay, so that's kind of be that's going to be what I'll be showing you next
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.280]   Okay, so that's the idea here
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.720]   You've got a neutral energy capsule
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.480]   You can add a this sphere that's got the inner piece frequency and make it an inner piece frequency
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.920]   Capsule or you can actually add any frequency and the way you do that is with a little piece of foil
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.840]   So now that you know, that's just like what I was saying here with any frequency
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:52.080]   You just copy the frequency to a piece of foil that you insert inside the capsule with only the purple and neutral energy spheres
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.800]   now when I say any frequency, it's basically anything that
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.000]   You can you want to use so you can use supplements you can use essential oils
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.040]   You can use any of the ladle of cards
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.280]   You know the ladle frequencies that they sell on the website or if you have a block
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.640]   You can make your own frequencies
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.760]   But the idea though is that you're gonna you know
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.320]   It's basically gonna be a substance any type of substance out there that you want to add
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.800]   That you can actually embed into that foil now if you have a block you can do other types of
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.880]   Frequencies beyond just physical substances. You can actually add a resident frequency
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:30.360]   So if you're into like, you know that is it, you know, isochronic tones the sulfegio tones, you know, right frequencies
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.320]   All those kinds of things can be embedded, but you need a block to do that. Okay, just as I heads up another video
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   Okay, so then the way to do that now there is a tutorial on Leila Q's
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.440]   YouTube channel called How to Copy Frequencies with the Leila Quantum capsule video
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.880]   In the video description below, I'll provide I'll provide a link to that video now if you just watch this three little three-minute video by Philip
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.000]   We'll just show you how to use the spheres themselves. So you would basically take
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.880]   These five little spheres and you clump them up put them in a little what I call a sphere packet like a little piece of foil
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:09.720]   With the spheres inside of it and you can use that to copy frequencies onto a piece of foil that you put inside
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.360]   So you if you already just all you have you don't need to have a block if you just have the capsule
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.040]   You bought the neutral capsule while you have the spheres and now you can go ahead and add frequencies to it
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.080]   And turn it into any type of capsule that you want or if you have a block
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.720]   I'll show you how to do that as well on this really super easy with the block
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.960]   So now I'm gonna give you a little demo kind of walk you through it
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.600]   And let's talk about what you get now when you first
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.400]   Receive your super capsule. It's gonna come in this purple satchel or pouch
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.440]   And it's gonna have the little, you know rope necklace that you can use or you can make your own
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.960]   It's gonna have the five purple spheres the one little silver sphere
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.480]   This is your inner piece frequency and of course the capsule itself in this little baggie, okay?
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:55.040]   So that's what you're gonna get now if you want to make your own frequency
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.080]   Foil to put inside so that like you could make it, you know your own
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.680]   Separate little you know quantum energy capsule with your own special frequency
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:10.680]   Then what you're gonna do is you're gonna want to take a piece of foil like this and you want to want to make it the width of the capsule itself
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.720]   So that's kind of important because you want it to roll up and put it inside the capsule
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.240]   Now I go with about like a four inch length you could use a three inch length or two inch length
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.720]   You know
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.200]   But either one works then what you do with that piece of foil
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.040]   If you cut it out is you fold it up into a little square and the reason you need to have it to be a little square
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.920]   Because you want it to fit under the under the packet of spheres
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:35.720]   so in this example here I've taken just a capsule of lion's mane and it basically opened it up and put some of the lion's mane on top of
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:43.640]   The little full you know the foil that's all folded up and then you just go ahead you take your little sphere packet that Phillip talks about in his video
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.880]   And you put it on top of that and then you just put it on there for 20 minutes minimum
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:54.080]   You can do up to 30 that's fine, and then what that's gonna do is that's going to then take the frequency of the lion's mane
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.420]   Right, and it's gonna embed that molecular frequency into that foil
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.600]   Okay, now if you have a card
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.280]   Then you take the card now what I kind of do and Phillip showed it a little differently
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.640]   But what I do is I place my card so that the corner of the card is directly over the foil
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:14.080]   So that I know exactly where the foil is under the card so that when I put the packet of spheres on it
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.640]   I know exactly where to put the spheres. You know it's just a little more accurate, but bottom line
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.760]   That's exactly how you would copy a frequency off of a card onto that piece of foil
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.520]   Now if you have a liquid then you're gonna want you can't use the bottle right because it's too
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.080]   It's too wide. So you just put a drop of the of the essential oil onto that foil
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.320]   Take the sphere packet put it on top 20 to 30 minutes
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.160]   Boom now if you saw that was a mer and central oil one of my favorites
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.480]   And then it's gonna take the molecular frequency of the essential oil and embed that into that little tiny piece of foil
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.880]   So then it's that after 20 30 minutes
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.040]   Then you would take that piece of foil unfold it and then what I do is I wrap it around a pen
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:59.080]   To kind of make a little cone shape because now you're gonna insert that piece of foil into the capsule
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.600]   Okay, and you want it to be like a liner on the inside of the capsule
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.880]   So that basically the entire inside of the capsule has now has the frequency foil
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:14.400]   So that the spheres are inside the foil right so that when the spheres broadcast outward
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:20.160]   They have to broadcast through that foil which then basically emits that frequency into the field
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:26.480]   So then what I do and this is kind of a little trick is you want to put the foil okay inside the cap and
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.920]   It's all because of how the threads work in the capsule
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:36.400]   So I put the foil inside the cap and as you can see I put then I put the spheres inside the foil and then you just
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.720]   Screw it together. So now as you can see the spheres are inside the foil inside the capsule
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.320]   And now if this was let's say a mer frequency foil
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:51.400]   I have now just taken my neutral energy capsule, and I've turned it into a mer it's now
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:57.760]   It's not broadcasting mer you know mer frequency in the quantum energy capsule and that's how to do that now
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:03.200]   For those of you folks who own a block the process to copy a frequency on the piece of foil is really quite simple
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.840]   Philip does have a tutorial on the on the YouTube channel called Layla Quantum Block Brief summary video
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.200]   And I mean link in the video description below where he kind of just tells you how to go about doing it
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:19.440]   So for those of you have a block you might want to take a peek at this video the copy frequency part in that video is at the
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:25.760]   2.5 minute mark so you can just go jump right to it and take a look at how he describes how to do it
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.760]   It's really quite simple
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.560]   He's basically put in you know the source of the frequency in the piece of oil for the allotted time
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.480]   And that's it and you can make any kind of frequency as you want now for those of you who are thinking hey
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.840]   What if I want to combine?
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.600]   You know like six different supplements and I want to put that into my sphere or I want to put that into a piece of
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:48.680]   Oil to put it in my sphere. Well, then you use a block you need to have a block because then you can combine all of those different things
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:54.280]   Inside the block with a piece of foil in that foil will hold the frequency of multiple different sources
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:59.480]   So that's how you would do that. Otherwise, you know, that's it for the tutorial. Thank you very much for your time
