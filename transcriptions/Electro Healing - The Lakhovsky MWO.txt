[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another ElectroHealing video. I'm your host
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.120]   Keelmer and in this video I would like to share with you my research and the
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.360]   story of the Likoski multi-wave oscillator also known as the Likoski
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.760]   M.W.L. Now most of you probably never even heard of this device so before I
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.080]   start my story and my presentation I would like to challenge you with a
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.400]   simple question. Now what would you say to me if I were to tell you that back in
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.440]   the 1920s, Belarusian French scientist living in Europe came up with a theory
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:47.000]   that he could cure cancer, diseases, ailments, wounds with simply electrical
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.440]   frequency. Not just any old electrical frequency like putting a fork in a
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.520]   electrical outlet which we probably all did is to kill children but more so an
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.000]   oscillating frequency and not just any frequency all frequencies and what by
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.580]   oscillating I simply mean vibrating. So you would probably say you know that's
[00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.880]   crazy because you know if wow if we knew that there was a cure for cancer oh you
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.640]   know that would change everything right well come along with me. Let's talk
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.100]   about the Likoski multi-wave oscillator. So first of all it's kind of a big
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.880]   topic. There's a lot about it that I wanted to share so I've kind of organized
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.740]   it in this fashion. The first thing I want to share with you that this is
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.660]   Georges Likoski. He lived from 1869 and he died in August of 1942. What I'd like to
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:47.340]   cover with you in this video is just an overview of the story of the M.W.L. and
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.400]   then I'd like to you know share with you a demo of the one that I own and how I
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.040]   use it and in that video part section of the video I'll kind of go over some of
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.840]   the history of of Georges Likoski's research and then let's talk about even
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.280]   most importantly right is the biological effects of this device as I just
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.520]   mentioned are pretty amazing and pretty you know unbelievable. So let's talk
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.120]   about the biological effects and what the research is for that and then you
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.080]   know for those of you who are interested in this device you know there's a
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.160]   possibility you know people have built their own or you could buy one and if
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.920]   you want to learn more about the Likoski M.W.L.L. then you know I'll share that
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.800]   with you as well. So it's kind of a complete package about this incredibly
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.560]   amazing individual and device that I am just so happy to share with you today.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.040]   Now I do want to have a short little disclaimer that all information contained
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.240]   in this video is for entertainment purposes only and should not be construed
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.600]   as medical advice. Okay so with that said the thing about the multi-wave
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.440]   oscillator is that Georges Likoski had a theory and a theory was it was that all
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.880]   live vibrated all cells even down to the chromosome the mitochondria and
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.400]   everything in our cells and you know the cell is you know it basically has a
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.120]   fluid in it with everything floating around you know if you've seen you know
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.720]   pictures of microscopes and you see a cells and it's it's liquidy in there and
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.920]   that liquid is actually like seawater it's in water in a plasma state and you
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.200]   know all of that everything everything that makes us who we are all of our
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.280]   cells the atoms all that you know are moving around right it's all moving
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.480]   around you ever see microscope everything's moving around right you know the
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.840]   blood the all that and all of that movement is vibration and all of that
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.840]   vibration is frequency and so back in the 1920s that was Georgia Likoski's
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.240]   theory that if if things vibrated then when they were in a healthy state they
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.360]   vibrated one way and if they were in an unhealthy state they vibrated another
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.880]   so you know simply using the idea of entrainment you know if you could just
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.160]   get the healthy cells to vibrate I'm sorry the unhealthy cells to vibrate at
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.920]   a healthy frequency that would be like quote normal for that then they would
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.960]   they would become healthy and that's what his theory was so he worked on it
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.480]   for about ten years starting in in the early 20s and by the 30s he had a
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.440]   working device that was literally used throughout Europe and it was under the
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.520]   brand name of kalisa and this is the actual kalisa machine and some of the
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.840]   clinical photographs of that time period back in the 30s and in the in early 40s
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.840]   of this machine being deployed and used in Europe and so it was actually all the
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.600]   way up until the 1940s and it was finally introduced in the United States in the
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.320]   late 30s early 40s where it started to be used here by doctors and hospitals and
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.840]   also veterinarians as well and so it's an actual real thing it's a real
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.120]   medical you know device that was used by hundreds of doctors it successfully
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.920]   because otherwise you know how would he be able to stay in business and it was
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:08.840]   successful so so much so that let me let me share with you this really kind of
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.120]   cute film reel from the early 40s of it's kind of like back then remember that
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.440]   you know you're watching old movies right they have the film reel they didn't
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.600]   really have TV and so they watched film reels that was their quote commercials
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.080]   so let me go ahead and play that for you and kind of give you an idea that hey
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.720]   this is this is this was a real actual you know medical protocol that was in
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:39.040]   use back in the day before most of us were even born here we go
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.720]   Brooklyn's all years summer resort the sun's purity brains are tapped in January
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.540]   as well as in June but it's multiple wave oscillator which
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.000]   concentrates the electoral frequencies with much energy but little heat to play
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.080]   up on the delicate skin with great therapeutic results removing wrinkles
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.920]   when and it found but never disturbing a dimple
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.760]   so if you found that entertaining I did as well believe me it was just it's
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.040]   such a treat to see stuff from back in that time period especially about
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.600]   something that you know it's literally forgotten except for a very small handful
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.400]   of people and one of the things of the story of the Lacoskey multi wave oscillator
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.480]   is that it was pretty much in use in the early 40s and then if you notice
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:35.400]   Lacoskey you know passed away in 1942 and what was going on at that time well
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:42.600]   1942 was the year the first year of the war two and in the chaos of of that time
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:49.080]   period and the in in the entire focus of of all of the resources of the planet
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.280]   going towards the you know military and war and especially in Europe being
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.480]   completely just destroyed then this technology this methodology and the
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:06.040]   people that used it just sort of disappeared and so by the 60s only
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.160]   remnants of this of this technology and this methodology was still in use and
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.840]   so along came a gentleman by the name of Dr. Bob Beck and this guy was an engineer
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.040]   who you know had a lot of patents to his name he was an inventor and he was
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:29.000]   actually one of the individuals who was part of like the government I forget
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.960]   what government body but he was like this inspector general kind of guy who
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.520]   would basically you know validate you know medical claims that were done by
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.240]   electronics because you know that was his thing he was an electronics guy and so
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.400]   in in the in a few minutes I want to share with you a testimony by Bob Beck
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.080]   himself that was recorded in the late 80s around 1987 where he talks about the
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.800]   lacoskey multi wave oscillator and you got you got to stick around for that when
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.000]   Bob Beck talks about it that back in 1962 you know his team had evaluated
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.760]   this device and you know because there were still a few around and what they
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.560]   discovered is just an amazing testimony so you know that's coming up in a few
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.240]   minutes now the rest of the story now that was back in the 60s right so it
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.680]   kind of got lost in the 50s after World War II and then of course Bob Beck
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:24.320]   rediscovers it in the 60s and then in the 70s and 80s two gentlemen by the name
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.200]   of Eric Dallard and Thomas Brown and you know these guys are with borderland
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   sciences they rediscover it they start working with Bob Beck and they start
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.360]   bringing this lot Milikovsky multi wave oscillator back into the attention but
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.760]   pretty much only with the the technical you know you know people and the technical
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.200]   folks not necessarily with the medical that's why you don't hear about it you've
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.920]   never even heard one or seen one in any of your doctor's offices it just doesn't
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.360]   exist in the medical industry but over here with all these electronics guys who
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.360]   you know it's their hobby their tinkerers their their inventors and so these guys
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.000]   picked this thing up they work with Bob Beck in fact there's a video of these
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.920]   guys presenting the Lukovsky multi wave oscillator which is where I extracted
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:12.360]   Bob Beck's testimony from it's great if you really are interested in the history
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.280]   of how this thing came back into consciousness into our you know into our
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.320]   current day thinking then you know this is that story so now what happened after
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.840]   that which is even the most remarkable and this is what made it happen this is
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.800]   what brought back the multi wave oscillator into the our commercial
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.080]   opportunity where you can literally go buy one now is these two guys and then
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.400]   all of these gentlemen Bob Beck you know you know Eric Daller Tom Brown I mean
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.200]   all of these people are just amazing and I really want to put them in this
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:49.240]   video because if it wasn't for these five guys right this technology would have
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:54.000]   been lost to the to the you know to the to the black hole of history but they
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.880]   brought it back to life and because they were interested in it so now what
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.080]   happened in the 90s in the 2000s was these two guys now these are two electrical
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:09.320]   engineers living in in Europe and Bruno and Sacco and Tony Carrara sorry I'm
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.600]   gonna try to pronounce I'm sorry Tony if you see this I really sorry sorry sorry
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.800]   but your last name is curse Sirlars okay that's about as best as I'm gonna do
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.760]   but they're with multi-wave research and what they did they found one of these
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.680]   things they found an original Kalisa multi-wave oscillator from George's
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.720]   Likovsky's factory they found one I think they found three in the basement of
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.120]   some you know retired you know French doctor and they they basically acquired
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:45.160]   it and they spent years reverse engineering studying testing measuring
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:51.440]   every little tiny aspect of the Kalisa original multi-wave oscillator to figure
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.920]   out how it worked and they wrote they wrote the quintessential Bible about it
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.320]   called secrets revealed and and if anyone is ever interested in producing
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.200]   these machines that is your Bible and and and in fact you know using it or
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.200]   understanding it and so it's it's an amazing piece of work that Bruno and Tony
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.000]   has has brought to the world on the heels of Eric and all of these other
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.600]   gentlemen and I again you know I mean I'm I'm one of the tinkers I'm one of the
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:24.320]   nerds that is really into biological magnetics for over 20 years now and if
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:29.720]   it wasn't for these five guys this machine it does some amazing stuff and
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.320]   wait till we get into biological effects but now the next piece I want to
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.280]   share with you is that's that's the history of how it came back to life in
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.560]   terms of it's now now you know in the commercial world so what I want to talk
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.920]   about now is let me share with you my little homemade video and I apologize I
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.840]   recorded it a while back just to throw up on my blog is like hey look at this and
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.400]   and you know what it's kind of a really good explanation how the machine works
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.880]   I recorded it on my cell phone it's not super professional I apologize but you
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.040]   know what it shows you how multi-wave oscillator works all the different
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.480]   pieces and and you know and this is the one I own and the one that's sitting in
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.760]   my living room so let me go ahead and show you the demo and talk a little bit
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.720]   about the about George's a klabski himself and then we'll jump right into the
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.280]   biological effects and go from there all right
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:28.480]   Aloha and welcome to an episode of the electro healing and I'm featuring today
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:36.240]   a device that is called the Lukowski multi-wave oscillator and if you recall
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:44.480]   from my video on electro culture where the idea of using Lukowski coils to
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.960]   stimulate plant growth and or plant healing the same concept applied what
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:56.600]   Lukowski did was he originally started out with plants with his famous geranium
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.880]   experiment that was quite effective and then he went on to other living
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:06.640]   organisms and eventually he had actually developed this device here where the
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:13.120]   same concept supplied except instead of using coils very similar to this where
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.760]   it's just a solid coil all the way around with a gap in between which is a
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:24.360]   Lukowski coil he created these golden mean antennas and then attach them to a
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:29.920]   pulse modulator with the same concept now the basic theory here is in all
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.920]   life forms vibrate and as it basically a cellular harmonic he called it an
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:43.000]   oscillation and that oscillation when things are ill or diseased or dead or
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.160]   disabled that our cells no longer resonate at the right frequency so by
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:53.000]   using a pulse modulator such as this a very high power this goes up to 12 to
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.640]   15,000 volts it's got a transformer in here and basically with a spark gap in
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:04.640]   here it creates a pulse the electricity that's then transferred to this coil and
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.160]   then out through the antenna this is the transmitting antenna that's the
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.320]   receiving antenna the wire connects the two and by doing so between the two
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:18.800]   antennas it creates an electrical field that's pulsating every possible
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.160]   frequency into the gigahertz level and the reason that it pulsates is because
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.680]   the electricity the you know the signal comes out of here the pulsing comes out
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:34.680]   of the other coil and when it hits this very special antenna as it hits everyone
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.960]   as the current goes through the antenna as they actually go to each single one
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:43.760]   it's like ringing a xylophone it's like bong bong and but it's up and down the
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:49.600]   scale of every possible frequency that's being emitted through the pulsing of
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.960]   the electricity through the coil so that's the the general idea and the idea
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:15:01.560]   that people will then sit in between the coils be exposed to the electrical field
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.040]   and the pulsing vibrations that go through their bodies and through what I
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:12.600]   mentioned earlier cellular entrainment it the pulsing brings the body's natural
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:19.320]   healthy frequency up so that the body then can heal itself licopsies work and
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.560]   all of his experiments using machines such as this this is a replica of a
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:29.240]   multi-wave oscillator that was it's there's several people out there who are
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:33.960]   making licopsies multi-wave oscillators and this I would say is one of the
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:40.560]   closest replicas to the original it meets many of the specific requirements for
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.440]   you know for that classification but the idea though is that you sit in this
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.560]   machine or you sit between the antenna and then you are able to then resonate
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:56.800]   a every frequency possible it brings your body into cellular entrainment with all
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.960]   of the multiple healing frequencies and through that entrainment your body then
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:08.080]   can heal itself and regenerate and and basically enable and and come back alive
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.960]   even your your your disabled cells that you have from whether whether it's
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.440]   electron you know stealing toxic chemicals or diseases everything's
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.920]   running at the wrong voltage at the wrong frequency and this machine will
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.720]   bring you into cellular health that is the claim and if you do the studies on
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.480]   licopsies experiments he was able to cure a lot of different problems up to
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.560]   and including cancer and in some of his work and the results of his
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.840]   experimentations are just quite amazing and of course all of this was lost in
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.960]   the 40s and only a few companies are actually bringing it back mainstream so
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:51.200]   how this works is again this is the pulse modulator and what you've got here
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:57.320]   essentially this is of course the this is just a basically a fuse but this
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:02.720]   right here is the is the pulse the power modulator so what you've got
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.080]   basically coming in from the wall is 110 volt because we're in the United
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.600]   States and this mission and this dial right here you can dial all the way up to
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:16.520]   100 100% which is 110 volts and then it's not recommended that you run the
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.080]   machine at that high and there's a real I'll show you the reason why but then so
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.000]   normally what's recommended when using machine is running at around 50% power
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.600]   this here's the timer this is your amp meter to measure the amount of amps that's
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.240]   going through the antenna on an off switch and then right down here is a
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:39.720]   spark gap dial you can actually increase and decrease the spark gap so the whole
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:45.080]   idea is that you know running this at 50 power and 50 spark gap you pretty much
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.440]   will get what is like the normal treatment band you know and then you
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.680]   can crank it all the way up and get a much larger spark that's going on inside
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.960]   the box with the fan blowing and also a higher power but it's really not
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:04.400]   recommended to run the machine at that level of power and output for too long
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.880]   because the whole problem of their challenges not a problem but the
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.600]   challenge is when you turn this thing on and I'll show you in a second you'll see
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:17.120]   basically plasma lightning coming off of the antennas and if you're sitting in
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.840]   between the antennas and this is already a tight fit because the recommended
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.600]   distance between the antennas around 33 inches so depending on your size if
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.040]   you're sitting in between you know basically sitting in between your knees
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.200]   are coming out to about here and if you get any closer literally you're gonna
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.640]   you're gonna arc and it hurts so you don't want to do that so keeping this at 50%
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:44.120]   is probably the most recommended and experience tells me that to keep it up
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.820]   if you have traded higher and I got sapped okay of course there's the foot
[00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:52.760]   plate and the puppy pads because I've got a puppy right now and this is but here
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:57.880]   you go so now I'm gonna basically it is plugged in another really important part
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.640]   about using it is you never want to use it with anything else plugged in and give
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:08.760]   it a dedicated outlet trust me keep the wires away from the antenna and here we
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.400]   go but one of the things too is a peach over there in Norman they don't seem to
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.200]   mind it peach actually kind of likes it she hangs out with me when I'm running
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:21.240]   it okay so let's go ahead and set this guy up the light comes on it's turned on
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:27.240]   and it's at 50/50 and then this is what happens when you turn it on you see I'm
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.120]   going about three amps right here on the anteater I've got those things set at 30
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:38.040]   minutes for 35 40 minutes and off we go you can start hearing the multi-way
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.000]   oscillator running the adapting you're hearing it's a sparks coming off of the
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.680]   antenna you don't see the lights on deep watch out peeps like that and but you
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.040]   need to restart smelling ozone because one of the things about this that you
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.040]   really want to do is you want to make sure I got a fan over here out of
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:04.560]   out of brain but I got a fan you want to kind of aim the fan at the antenna to
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.120]   kind of keep the ozone from accumulating around your body while you sit there
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.640]   but I do want to show you the power coming off of this thing and you can see
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:18.760]   it right there and this is that 50% you see them little arching plasma that's
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:27.640]   coming off of the I had my camera too close to the antenna I just had a shock
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.600]   but anyway so it's really important you don't want to get too close to this
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.520]   thing and within about six inches and you're gonna get a shock I shouldn't even
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:42.680]   be in here but I'm gonna grab something I don't want to show you this is a
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:49.160]   violet ray antenna sorry a violet ray electrode or probe I could say from my
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:53.280]   one of my violet ray machine and it's an argon helium gas mixture inside of a
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.640]   tube so you can see this thing I'm standing really far away I'm about 3 feet
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.520]   away you can see that it's already picking up the electrical fuel from the
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:08.520]   antenna and lighting up the argon now if I walk away you'll see that the bulb all
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:12.800]   the sudden so you can kind of tell based on the number of square each pile of
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:19.080]   12 inches that right about here I am standing approximately about three and
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.680]   a half feet from the antenna and I'm already picking up the electrical field
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.600]   so what happens and this is a point is you're sitting in the middle of this
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:32.320]   big bubble it's like this big bubble of an electrical field in your smack dab in
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.800]   the middle I was getting all of the vibrations coming off the spark gas glass
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:42.280]   pulse modulator but let me show you the power that you can see how great the bulb
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:50.800]   gets the actual sparking coming off of the antenna and that's that right there
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:56.000]   and that is the the voltage going through the antenna all of that sparking or
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.240]   that is all a frequency the frequencies are being emitted through that spark
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:06.680]   and it's quite powerful now the receiving antenna is not powerful obviously but
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.760]   you can't see that it is actually an electrical field so that's kind of the
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.640]   cool part I kind of play with this guy it's not it's not a very big one but it's
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.800]   kind of fun to play to get you see that thing light up and have control anyway
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.640]   so that's my multi-way oscillator I'm gonna go sit in it now for a little while
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:30.880]   and take a treatment and we'll catch you guys later okay well welcome back I hope
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.200]   you enjoyed my demo yes that really is sitting in my living room and yes it's
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:40.680]   that loud and you know what I've never had a complaint so far so but yeah the
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.640]   idea of using it if you go back into the original literature of when doctors
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:50.160]   were using it the prescription you know is sort of like 15 minutes every couple
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.040]   of days there are days where I just don't have time to mess with it so I
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.240]   try to use it around that but you know and but there I go through periods of
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.600]   time you know you can see how big that thing is it takes up a huge chunk of
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.640]   real estate in the living room so you know it's kind of like I don't really
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.400]   there are days there are times there have been times because I've owned that
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.160]   thing over like 10 years but there have been times where I just didn't have room
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.440]   for it so it was packed up in a closet so I go periods of times without even
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.680]   using it but mostly I try to keep it out I try to use it because to me I you
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.520]   know personally my personal opinion I look at the lacoskey multi-wave
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.040]   oscillator I look at it as the fountain of youth you know along with the other
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.160]   things that I do you know it's it's you know again it's amazing this and we're
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.920]   here now we're talking about now this part of the presentation is about the
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:42.640]   biological effects now one of the things about understanding what it
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.800]   actually really does at a science level Bruno and Tony you know their quintessential
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:52.160]   like I said they wrote it all up but I want to just share with you the some of
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.560]   the material that has that's that's on this now there's not a lot I mean you
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.960]   know this thing disappeared in World War II it really disappeared in everything
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.680]   that was about it just disappeared with it and so now so all we really have that's
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.920]   available right now on the internet to kind of understand about okay what does
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.200]   this thing actually really do and then you know you know there's a lot about it
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.960]   from like oh I want to build one in the technology aspect of it but I'm more I'm
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.520]   not I'm not really like a electronical engineer kind of mentality I'm more like
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.600]   oh let me get my hands on one and I want to tinker with it that's my that's my
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:27.680]   lane I drive in and so there's only really like four different sources of
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.160]   information that really will convey the biological effects and one of them
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.080]   obviously is George of the Kloffski's own writings and then there another
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.040]   gentleman after George of Kloffski and I don't remember what the year this was I
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.600]   got his book we can take a look at that a guy named Mark Clement wrote a book
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:47.080]   called The Waves at Heal where he took the Kloffski any any basically put it into
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.440]   practice using it on people and documented the results which is an
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.320]   excellent you know that's a really nice body of work that really kind of shows
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.640]   this again the Bob Beck testimony I'm gonna play that and then Bruno and and
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.280]   Tony now I just want to point out they didn't just write a book about the
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:05.240]   multi-wave oscillator they wrote a second book about the biological effects of
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.080]   the multi-wave oscillator and so we'll be taking a look at that when we get into
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.720]   this so now the first thing I want to do is talk about George of the Kloffski's
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:19.200]   what he had to say about it and it's in the book and all of the basic I want
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.640]   to share everything I'm sharing with you or if I bring up a YouTube video or a
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:29.560]   website or a book everything except Tony and Bruno's book are gonna be links
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:34.640]   for that over in my over in my blog okay so if you want to go do any more
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.280]   research you want to take a look at something get a copy of a free book except
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.360]   for Tony and Bruno's because though that's copyright and I really want to
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.200]   support those guys you need to buy one of those but if you want to take a look
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.360]   at the book radiation and wave sources of our life by George of the Kloffski
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:53.280]   it's free come over to my blog you can download it all right so now in his book
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.960]   and this was the book where I bet it's he wrote is he kind of considered this
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.960]   book a booklet he referred to it as a booklet where he just you know kind of
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.480]   was like a high high the high points and he wrote another book called The Secret
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.760]   of Life which is got his entire theory in it but I just want to from a standpoint
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:14.200]   of well biological effects I want to point out just real you know I don't
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.320]   want to I can I could do this video in two hours but I just don't want to that's
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.680]   way too long but I'm just gonna kind of jam through it but if you go through
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.320]   his book then you will see the actual evidence that George of the Kloffski
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:30.240]   documented because you know he used this in concert with doctors so he was a
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.560]   scientist but you know he had doctors using his machine and and they worked
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.080]   in partnership but a lot of the times you could see where people had had tumors
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:43.560]   and they would use them Likovsky multi-wave oscillator and the tumors would
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:49.160]   shrink or completely go away so this is a picture of an ulcer same thing it was
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:54.560]   healed this picture is of a it's that this photograph on the left is a the
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:27:00.800]   picture of David Ford treatment began around a let's 58 I'm sorry 82 year old
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.600]   woman she's got this ulcer on her norm probably due to tumors and then
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:11.040]   basically there's 35 days later completely healed gotten and then of
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.440]   course there's you know there's this book was written a long time ago so sorry
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.320]   about the pictures and unfortunately this guy has a giant tumor on his face
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:23.240]   and the second photo after treatment has it gotten smaller and then here's a
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.760]   lady basically had a big goiter this is a big problem you know 100 years ago
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.840]   people have goiters and using Likovsky it was completely eradicated so you know
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:37.400]   if this is the book for Georgia's Klofsky's documented biological effects of the
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.600]   M.W.O. and you could find that over on my blog let's take a quick peek see we
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.800]   figure out what when this was written okay this was copyright 1941 so yeah
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:50.800]   80 years ago there he is he wrote this book to kind of you know this was him
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:56.160]   sharing his by his his results so now you've got the results directly from
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.680]   Georgia's Klofsky now let's take a look at the waves that heal this is by Mark
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.760]   Clement I mentioned earlier now let's see if we can I don't think that there's a
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.840]   copyright on here some of these old books they just don't have that you know
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:14.280]   it's not like today everything's got an ISBN and so in this book you know it
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:19.000]   basically is is a gentleman where he took and he did a short account of the
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.480]   theories of Georgia's Klofsky and he documented the results of treatments of
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:28.960]   plants animals and human beings okay so now if you read this book it's 62 pages
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.800]   then you'll have you'll get kind of this summary so I kind of pulled this out of
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.080]   the book now and this is basically what's in the book of the Mark Clement he
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.480]   waves a heel what does this incredible machine do well they took a bunch of
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.680]   patients by you know here's their initials and then this was their illness
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.880]   and their problem and then they gave them this many treatments and then over
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.080]   here was their results so I'm just kind of kind of you know just braws through
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.240]   this thing but you know here's an individual with acute urinary retention
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.960]   due due to enlarged prostate retention ceased problem went away bleeding from
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.800]   uterine fibro fibroids for two years standing two years three treatments
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:11.200]   bleeding ceased here's one uh cellulite littis sorry I have nose of nose with
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.640]   pain completed two treatments completely clear it cleared 10 minutes in one day
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:19.200]   two treatments of 10 minutes in one day and then it goes on and then here's a
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:26.920]   chronic eczema of axilla two treatments cleared entirely osteoarthritis seven
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.320]   treatments marked improvement after two treatments stiffness diminished here's
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:37.760]   patient DG chronic arthritis again 10 treatments no cough I have no idea what
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:43.080]   that has to do with arthritis but no soreness marked improvement a lot of
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.560]   arthritis guys let's see if we could find a different one you know it looked
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:50.160]   like they had a lot of arthritis patients coming in I'm not sure what
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:54.720]   this word is of shoulder it got better this one got better and you just like
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:00.480]   right down here's here's the list and it's in the book okay problem ceased cleared
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:05.240]   entirely good improvement results good improvement improvement good good good
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:10.080]   good you get my point yeah okay so that's the biological effects as measured by
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:14.200]   Mark Clement and don't know what year but this has got to be from you know
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:20.360]   40s to 50 probably 50s maybe the 40s probably okay and so now the next one
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:25.440]   that I want to kind of share with you is the testimony by Bob Beck so let's go
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:31.120]   ahead I basically clipped out just the pieces where he talks just about the
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.960]   testimonial like it's use I think it's like a three minute little clip so let me
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:39.040]   go ahead and play that and and kind of just you know listen this is Bob Beck
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.760]   now this is Bob Beck's one of the founding fathers of biological
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:48.440]   magnetics and and this is his story about his evaluation of the lakovsky
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:54.840]   multi-wave oscillator back in 1962 so here you go
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:02.200]   okay since this is coming around again I thought those of you who are sort of
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:07.000]   new to the field might like just a very brief thumbnail history about a quarter
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   of a century ago I was the judge jury and executioner on every new age device
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.760]   that came through Southern California that included free energy motors healing
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:22.240]   devices you name it and in the course of a good year we'd examine maybe a hundred
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:30.720]   125 devices and about 99.9% of them were either placebo garbage or wishful
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:35.880]   thinking hallucination but once in a long while we would come across something
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:42.840]   that was exceptional and in 1962 it was the lakovsky multiple wave oscillator now
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.680]   I am going to say I reserve the right to change my mind about anything I'm
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:52.400]   telling you and number two we wish we'd had someone like Eric dollard around at
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:57.800]   the time we were playing with this but what we did is we built a very small
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.360]   device small being the size of an adder shake case that had the lakovsky
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:07.840]   antennas driven by a Tesla coil the first thing I did was call up all of my
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:13.240]   sick friends lined them up and did experiments on them couldn't do that
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:18.560]   today because of FDA we cured Tommy Herod's father who was about to have an
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:24.480]   amputated leg diabetic edema it was out within about a week he'd gotten the
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.800]   driver's license legally was walking again we cured any number of cancer
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:38.200]   patients we found that many of these had wound up in the hands of veterinarians
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.840]   we published this schematics and the veterinarians were carrying cancer in
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:48.480]   animals that other vets would put to sleep so word would get around and the
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:53.920]   veterinarians would bring sick animals to the guy that had it and they get well
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:33:01.880]   so this was long before the term scalar longitudinal soliton buzzwords were
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.440]   floating around and not too sure that anybody thoroughly understands what
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:11.640]   these mean in the actual universe but we were getting really stunning results
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:17.760]   the animals would respond to this much more rapidly than the human beings my
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:22.760]   vice president many years ago in back tech was the astronaut Gordon Cooper we
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.520]   loaned it to him he had a 15 year old police dog that had been part of the
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:32.240]   family forever dog was dragging itself around its hind legs weren't working
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:36.800]   after two days the dog was up frisking around running around the swimming pool
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:43.000]   so garden would take this box wherever he went to Washington Houston NASA it was
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.720]   getting people out of wheelchairs but we're not supposed to talk about this and
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.680]   it took a long time to get that thing back from him a few years ago when we
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:58.520]   went our separate ways now that was an actuality why it works we don't know what
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:05.200]   is electricity I have graduate degrees I don't know but in a year this was one of
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:11.120]   the most exciting things that can come along so if you found that interesting
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:16.960]   or amazing because that's you know honestly for me that video came out over
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.960]   ten years ago and when I saw Bob Beck talk about that that's why I went and
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:27.840]   bought one and and it you know and and that's I've had it ever since so you
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:32.840]   know it's it's an amazing story okay so now the last one on the biological
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:38.000]   effects is Bruno and Tony's book itself now they wrote a book like I said they
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.040]   wrote two books one about the machine and one about the effects of the machine
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.960]   and it's basically multi-wave research it's the biological effects of exposure
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:51.000]   to multi-wave oscillator oscillator fields okay now the thing that I want to
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   point out in this book is way down here page 111 they you know they talk about
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.440]   the machine and everything but they get into when they actually started testing
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:06.320]   this thing and measuring this thing because they talk a lot about you know
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:11.240]   electromagnetic effects on you know cellular structures and so forth but
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:17.680]   when you actually really get into this jump the gun here page 102 then what I
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:21.240]   want to point out is is one of some of their findings and one of their findings
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.240]   was is hey this thing when you measured it puts out a pulse to electromagnetic
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.320]   field which you know obviously you know that it's oscillating that means it's
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:34.120]   vibrating but it's vibrating at a pulse and that pulse carries frequency so and
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.800]   that's what they really were out to try to figure out was that that's what this
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:42.360]   thing was doing and and so let's see one of the quotes in here that I think was
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:49.440]   was worth sharing is that just pulsed electromagnetic fields alone okay
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:54.360]   they're biological effects if you take a look at this is pulse
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.660]   electromagnetic are part of high frequency therapy in use in rehabilitation in
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:05.280]   Europe I mean it this is a today modern modality that is in use across the
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:11.840]   medical field is PMF and that's what one of the things that this this device the
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:18.960]   M.W.O. does is it's a PMF device and and more okay and and just PMF alone in
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   terms of biological fact is that it's used in the treatment of rheumatic
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.240]   traumatic respiratory digestive dermatological flambolic this I guess
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.800]   that's blood diseases and the mechanism is not due to the production of
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:37.960]   heat okay but acts exclusively you know by the specific
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:44.080]   electromagnetic energy up to the infrastructure level with changes in cell
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:48.000]   metabolism okay and it goes on and on and on about you know how it actually
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.840]   works specifically in the enzyme enzymic sorry having a moment here
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:37:00.080]   enzymic reactions activation of hepatic I should have read this like five times
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.480]   for I tried this adrenal functions I got that I'm not even try this word but you
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:12.280]   get my point all right just the PMF action of it is has a tremendous amount
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:17.600]   of effect and then made a note here to take a look at page 11 and I wanted to
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   kind of share with you with Tony and Bruno wrote about was that this is on
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.640]   page at 111 one of Georgia's college theories that the cells of the body could
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:30.000]   be charged up by applying broadband electromagnetic energy to them ether I
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.360]   says if you subject the body to a broad range of electromagnetic harmonics okay
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:39.880]   so now not only do you have this pulsing this PMF action going on okay but
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:44.800]   you're also project your actual transmitting energy in a broadband
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:50.280]   electromagnetic frequency range so you got two different things going on and so
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.920]   that was George I was there Georgia's theory that's what this machine does and
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:38:00.480]   then when they measured what it did this was what they came out with was it gets
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:07.160]   down in here okay so but okay so then it gets down in here and it says we don't
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.840]   know if Lukowski knew about transmembrane potentials but he was
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:15.840]   amazingly close to the truth if you take Lukowski's charging up of cells to mean
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.200]   hyperpolarizing them then the theory makes a lot of sense because as already
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:26.320]   explained above if you hyperpolarize a cell then you refuel its ATP supply by
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.200]   driving the sodium potassium pump and reverse and then what about harmonics
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.140]   well we believe Lukowski was right about that too the electrical
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:38.720]   characteristics of the body cells in fact all cells pathogens as well very
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:43.480]   enormously because of changes in electrical permitted EV sorry gosh I'm
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:48.480]   sorry and every different type of cell and tissue will absorb EM radiation okay
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:53.800]   so you know I got to say this book is worth the read if you're interested in
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:59.080]   what this incredible machine does by these two engineers that studied
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:05.600]   everything about it and so with that said I just wanted to wrap up that not
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.720]   only do you have like case studies documented by Mark Clement you got
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.640]   testimony by Bob Beck of course Lukowski's own case studies and then the actual
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:19.800]   measurement of the device and how it works and and what's happening at the
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:26.640]   cellular level you know it is pretty strong evidence that this machine does
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:31.720]   what it says it does especially you know when Bob says it does so you know
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.920]   that's that is probably the most amazing part of this story I hope you
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.880]   stayed stayed this long to hear it because it is clearly the most amazing
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:44.160]   part now so let's jump into what about case now you're interested right if
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.520]   you're interested hey you know well can you build your own Avi's absolutely you
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.160]   could build your own there's a couple of guys on YouTube that did build their
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:54.400]   own and they kind of showed off in their videos and if you want to build your own
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.640]   or if you want to buy one you want to learn more all right come over to my
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:01.240]   blog okay by the way you know you guys know okay I don't have any I don't have
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:05.600]   any affiliations I don't own any stock or anything in any of these companies you
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.440]   know I'm just sharing okay there's nothing to do with anything like that is
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.000]   about sharing so now this is my blog I want to point you to where you can find
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.200]   this information you know about building buying and learning more okay so now
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.360]   if you come to my blog I got different little you know areas that are kind of
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.920]   of my interests that I kind of kind of do research on and share under electro
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.980]   healing I have a page dedicated to George's Akoski right there click on that
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:31.480]   puppy and then you're gonna come to my like kofsky page now my like kofsky page
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.800]   right here is where I'm gonna put this video right right here I haven't you
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.840]   know of course finished it I'm gonna put the video right here and then right
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.000]   here are all the links for you know that I would normally put in the video
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.200]   description I'm just gonna leave it all on my blog it's easier to maintain one
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:49.200]   site than two and so here they are right here is you know here's your books by
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.600]   George Akoski other books by on the Lukaski multi-wave oscillator if you're
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:58.000]   interested in getting those books some of them are free others you have to you
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.080]   would have to pay Tony for and then of course talking about building okay let's
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:06.600]   talk about building now I know there's some of you electrical engineers out
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:11.560]   there and you love this stuff and if you are peaked and curious and hey I want to
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:17.040]   build one then okay right off the bat you definitely absolutely 100% need to
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:22.640]   buy Tony and Bruno's book okay the secrets revealed that's this guy okay so
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.840]   and then you just go to the website and just give me you know it's you know and
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:32.960]   just email him and you can buy the book okay now the next thing is is I did you
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.560]   know I've been scouring the internet for as long as it's been around honestly I
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:42.040]   was on the internet before the worldwide web was on the internet and so one of
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.520]   the things that popped up a few years ago was the actual schematics somebody
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:55.800]   in I believe it's Italy created a a document okay and and they wrote a
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:02.640]   document called the schema electro-kill original solator on the multiple lacos
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:07.760]   key sorry about the accent and it's it's it's in a different language so you're
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:13.400]   gonna be challenged here but they wrote a book an ebook about how to build one
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:20.800]   and they've got all of the schematics okay Ben and here you go and you could
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.840]   build it and here's everything you need to know and and all of the different
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:29.360]   specifics and what types of you know equipment you're gonna need and there you
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:33.840]   go so if you are interested in building one here are the schematics here's the
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.880]   website to Tony site Tony Bruno and you know this gonna you go from there okay
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.800]   I'm not a I'm not a build guy I'm more of a tinker guy so now if you are a tinker
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:48.080]   person as well and you're looking to you know experiment and and in things that
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:53.160]   will help you stave off the ravages of aging cure diseases and all that by the
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.800]   way this is all purely for entertainment purposes no this is medical advice then
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:01.240]   you know this is where you could purchase these lacos keys now in order to
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:04.360]   purchase lacos keys there's I here's our you know it's there's not they're not
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.560]   for sale in very many places and here's pretty much where they're all this this
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.600]   that's it right there's one that's not here because it's only got one antenna
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:17.560]   and if you read Tony or Bruno's book they went and they proved that one antenna
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:21.840]   does not do anything that lacoskey had intended it's completely a waste of time
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:28.320]   you know sorry guys if you see this but one antenna multi wave oscillator doesn't
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:32.080]   do anything so it's a come you know do not waste your money you need to get the
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:37.600]   two antenna and really you know when you look at actual pictures of the original
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.280]   lacoskeys multi wave oscillator here's the original right it's got double
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.000]   antennas then it's really really important that it really have the same
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.760]   characteristics because you know these things aren't cheap I mean the cheapest
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.000]   one and mine by the way you're probably asking like how much did I pay for
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.680]   sure asking that after I learned about the multi wave oscillator a long time ago
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:01.600]   I basically camped on eBay waiting for a used one because I couldn't afford it
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.320]   they started back then we're talking 10 years ago they started at 5 grand and
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:11.240]   they go all the way up to 25,000 and so I kind of camped out on eBay and about a
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:15.440]   year and a half later it took a long time I finally somebody was finally gonna
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:19.200]   sell used one and so the one that was for sale used was from this company called
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.680]   Inspiral Technologies so if you kind of go to their website you're gonna see this
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.040]   is my this is the one I use okay and so that one I don't know what it is
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:31.560]   itself for today last ten years ago it's 5 grand and then of course you've got
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:36.520]   this the newest one here is by a company called Veril this is Aaron Murakami's
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:41.160]   website now and he started and this just came up last year in fact what's
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:46.080]   really cool is that Aaron is working this is the guy that runs Veril Aaron is
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:50.480]   that that's his machine is working with Eric Dollar if you remember I'd mentioned
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.960]   Eric or I mean I'm sorry one more Eric Dollar this guy right here well he's
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:00.360]   wailed her now and he's working with Aaron over here at Veril and they've
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:05.840]   replicated an actual working and literally a duplicate of the original one
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.360]   based on the work of Tony and Bruno and so they're claiming right now that they've
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:14.280]   got the closest replica if not a duplicate of the original MWA they made
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.120]   their first 20 production run last year and sold them at eight grand each they've
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:22.440]   got another 20 that they're trying to sell this year and I haven't asked Aaron
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:26.280]   how much he's selling the second run for but there's another 20 and by the way
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.320]   these you know like I these things don't they only make like one a month or
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.600]   something I know in spiral maybe makes one a month and that's you know there's
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.400]   so not a lot of these things out there because not a lot of people know about
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:41.280]   this device but they are now out for out there for sale like you know when I
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.520]   first got into it the only ones that were around selling him was in spiral and
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.640]   altered had one and so now you've got these other types of models out there
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:54.040]   like this guy and you know and it's basically got it's not really the same
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:57.680]   design and one of the things about you know if you're you saw that was like
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:00.440]   fifty four hundred right and if you take a look at some of these other
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:03.440]   designs then you're gonna notice that they're not they don't look like the
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:08.280]   original and if you really read the book and I don't mean to and I honestly I do
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:12.400]   not mean at all to disparage any of these other individuals who who gone
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:16.320]   painstakingly to build a multi-wave oscillator but you know but if you
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:21.360]   read you guys should read Tony and Bruno's book okay because this doesn't work
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:25.000]   the same way as the original one and if you're gonna spend that much money you
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.880]   want something that works so right now the closest thing that worked was this
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.560]   one from in spiral if you read their website they'll talk about they met the
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:40.000]   five key criteria and then real comes out and actually RT-17 came out and they
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.720]   built a replica that was almost a duplicate and but this one is 25 grand
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:49.640]   and then real comes out and they built the replica so right now when you look
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:55.720]   at like what are the top three right now out there closest replicas to the
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.040]   actual multi-wave it's gonna be those guys because these other guys like
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:03.760]   transformation technologies it's like IKEA furniture you know I mean they this
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.700]   one even includes a plasma bulb so it's like kind of this weird kind of
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.760]   hodgepodge rife machine and I don't want to disparage it I think it's like 12
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:15.000]   grand and I'm sure that it does something but you know if you are a
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.600]   purist and you are truly going after the same biological effects right that's
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:24.800]   what it's all about then I would say that you need to kind of just really take
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.760]   a look at all of these six sites talk to Aaron you know talk to him talk to the
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:33.200]   folks over here and kind of just get a feel for what would be the best for you
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:38.600]   okay but that's where to purchase and Likovsky are the here that's the six
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:45.000]   sites and my brief overview and now so the next thing is the lower last thing
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.040]   is really is like if you want to learn more so now if you did want to learn
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:51.400]   more about the Likovsky multi-wave oscillator now that I've kind of picked
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.680]   your interest then right here you can go over to multi-wave research this is
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.040]   Tony and Bruno's site okay and this they've got a lot more than just selling
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.660]   books here they've got the history of the multi-wave oscillator they've got
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:09.080]   videos and and so forth and they've got you know they even did a book on PMF I
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:12.640]   bought all of their books I just you know these guys are awesome and so and
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.960]   then so that would be to learn more you go to their site they've got a lot of
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.840]   information again and then here are some of the best YouTube videos on
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:23.640]   multi-wave oscillators if you go and type in Likovsky multi-wave oscillator in
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:28.440]   YouTube you'll get a bunch of videos of just people demonstrating you know how
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:32.480]   it works but there's three quintessential videos on on YouTube right
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.680]   now that really get into the depth and one is by Thomas Joseph Brown from
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.160]   Borderlands and that's a really great video to understand all the different
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:44.440]   models that were available back in the 70s and then of course you've got Aaron
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:48.760]   Murakami and he basically does a presentation on the actual electronics
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:52.120]   aspect so if you're an engineer and you want to build one you definitely need
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:56.160]   to be looking at Aaron's videos where he gets really really really into the
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.640]   actual technical aspects of it of course and then here's that original video
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.600]   right here the US Psychotronics Association and this is that video where
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:11.040]   I extracted Bob Beck's testimonial okay so with all of that said I really hope
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:15.520]   that this information was you know was was helpful and entertaining for you I
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:20.800]   just really want to say thank you for watching and thank you for learning
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.040]   about the Lukatsky multi wave oscillator I mean it's one of those things where
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:27.000]   you know this thing almost went into the dustbin of history for one for a few
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.160]   guys and then they've resurrected it and the biological effects are just
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.560]   unbelievable and now that they're available for sale in the market
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:38.720]   commercially you know that's an amazing comeback story and I hope it keeps going
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:44.480]   because if all of this stuff is true of what it does you know can imagine how
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:48.320]   much you can help us help all of us what one last thing I do want to share is
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:52.080]   that instead of you know there is one more option of buy-build there's an
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:57.040]   option where I've actually seen a couple and it just you know surfing around for
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:02.160]   years I've seen a couple of wellness centers that own them that actually
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:06.680]   provide treatments so that might be an option if you're interested in trying
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:12.480]   out Lukatsky is to just search to see it if anybody in your area owns one of
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:16.040]   these and sells treatments you just pay them some money like a chiropractor and
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:19.080]   you just go in there and try it out other than that you know you're you're
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:23.000]   at that state in that stage of the story where you're either gonna build or buy
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.360]   okay but lastly I just want to say again say thank you for watching now if you
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.760]   want to learn more about electro healing you want to learn more about
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:34.520]   Lukatsky then come down to my blog it's called the Tinkers Academy and all you
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.000]   need to do to get there is type in Tinkers.academy and your URL window on
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.600]   your browser and it'll take you right there to my blog we also have and we
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.040]   meaning there's a bunch of folks that are really interested in electro healing
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:48.720]   bio electrical magnetic devices that help heal and wellness for living
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:52.800]   organisms of which we are one then we have an electro healing telegram chat
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.280]   group and that link is gonna be below in the video description come join our
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:01.640]   chat I try to make a habit of least posting at least twice a week some just
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.720]   new topic let's chat about something new and get people's opinion on it and
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.280]   share some information I have a vast library and I'm always posting books up
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:13.400]   in there for people to read and download and you know so come on down if you want
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:17.880]   to learn more about electro healing and you can join our chat group and engage
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.640]   with the rest of us and ask questions and then I'm in there too if you want to
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.040]   talk to me otherwise come check out my blog and again lastly one more time

[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:32.760]   and thank you for watching this video and and and I'm hoping that you'll carry
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:36.920]   the story of the Lukatsky multi wave oscillator with you and that and
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:41.600]   hopefully if you can ever get your hands on one you know give it a try and see
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:48.280]   how it works for you all right well hey thanks a lot and have a great day Aloha
