[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and this
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.080]   video is a further installment in the video series. Welcome to Lele Q. Otherwise known as Lele Quantum
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.160]   Tech and Quantum Upgrade. This is a video FAQ series to answer numerous questions that pop up
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.800]   regularly in the Telegram chat groups. This specific video is to answer the question, you know, what
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.480]   are people experiencing? I mean, that question comes in many different forms and different flavors,
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.360]   but at the end of the day, people are just jumping in, they're new, they're welcome by the way,
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.120]   and they just want to know, like, what do people have to say? The problem, obviously, to answer that
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.800]   question is that the both chat groups go back years and the way the telegram works, it's just
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.200]   things just disappear, you know, as you scroll up. So one of the interesting things I thought I would
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.040]   do, trying to convey, you know, what, you know, kind of just, you know, how do I summarize and
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.720]   generalize what the customer, you know, what customers are saying is that here's the thing.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.320]   Every so often Lele Quantum Tech will have a contest and they'll have a contest. Well,
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.560]   they'll just say, hey, you know, guys, you know, just give us, just share with us what you're
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.640]   experiencing. Just tell us what's happening and how you, you know, how these things have helped
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.680]   you or whatever, just what's your testimonial and they'll do a contest and then they'll collect
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.160]   all these testimonials and then they'll start, you know, then what happens technically is that they,
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.720]   the moderators will collect all the testimonies, put them in a Google Doc,
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.760]   and then there's a total number like X, like, you know, what are normally it's like 80 or 100 or
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.120]   150, right? And then the basically, then the winners are selected at random, you know,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.840]   based on just the numerical sequence of the list. And then I'm the one that actually selects
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.960]   numbers. I don't know who's who. So I just, I just blindly selects numbers. Usually it's like,
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.000]   you know, I get a text and Phillips tells me, hey, pick 20 numbers out of between one and
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.920]   130 or whatever, right? So pick out the 20 numbers out of my head, tell them what the numbers are,
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.920]   and those are the winners, right? And then after all that's done, then Phillips sends me the Google
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.920]   Doc did so I can actually see who the winners are. But more importantly, I can see all the
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.600]   testimonies, right? So now I've been kind of just sitting on this information, not really
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.360]   sharing how to, how do I summarize that for you? And the idea came along where I'm been tinkering,
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.040]   you know, it's what I do. And I've been tinkering a lot with artificial intelligence or large language
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.840]   model software. And in terms of like how to summarize how to, you know, quantify large amounts of data,
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.560]   and so forth in my other life. And and so one of the things that I had a thought of the other
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.120]   night was, why don't I take all of these testimonies from the last contest that was back in June,
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.640]   and put it in the notebook, which is the notebook LM is the AI I'm using. It's by Google. And see
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.440]   what it can produce. And one of the outputs of this AI is it does a two person podcast. So it's a
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.680]   really great tool for researching for education for learning and all sorts of things. But essentially,
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.920]   you can put in anything you want into this thing, you could put in websites and PDFs and YouTube
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.640]   videos and whatever. And this using the power of Google data analytics, it'll go through all of
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.440]   that data, and it'll produce all sorts of things, it'll produce an FAQ, it'll put out a study guide,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.760]   it'll put out all these different outputs from the analyze data. One of those outputs again is a
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.720]   two person podcast, where the AI to AI characters are going to discuss all of the information that
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.960]   they have been given right by what I've given the AI. And they're going to discuss that information.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.720]   So I tried it, came out pretty good. I thought it came out really great. So I want to share with
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:49.200]   you a podcast by Google notebook LM, the AI on the most recent contest testimonies,
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.840]   as an answer for anyone who wants to know what are customers of Leila Quantum Tech saying
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:03.520]   about their experiences. So without further ado, here is the summation of the 80 plus something
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:11.200]   testimonies that were collected in June 2024 for the contest. And this is the AI summary
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.080]   in discussion format of those testimonies. So without further ado, here's the podcast.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.200]   Welcome back. Today, we're going to be taking a deep dive into user experiences with
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.040]   Leila Quantum products. Okay, our source material is a collection of testimonials from a recent
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.120]   giveaway entry. Interesting. And we're going to be focusing on categorizing and summarizing
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.320]   the experiences and the benefits that people reported, primarily for those who are unfamiliar
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.760]   with Leila Q products. Right. So to start, it looks like the quantum blocks are the most popular
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.320]   product. They are. There's the travel block, the infinity block and the gram block. So
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.200]   what are some of the common themes that you've seen in the testimonials about the blocks?
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.760]   Well, you know, across the board, people report positive experiences with them.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.920]   A lot of people talk about pain relief. They're saying that they've had, you know, headaches,
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.240]   injuries, even chronic pain has been improved. Interesting. And people also mention benefits
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.480]   related to emotional and mental well-being. Like, you know, they've got reduced anxiety,
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.880]   they're sleeping better, and they just feel more at peace. That's really interesting.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.560]   Yeah. It seems like, from reading the testimonials, that a lot of people report feeling more energy
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.480]   and vitality. That's right. After using the blocks. That's right. Some people even talk about
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:40.320]   accelerated healing and recovery from conditions. Yeah. There are some really interesting stories,
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.760]   you know, for example, one person talked about their husband, you know, their husband was really
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.840]   skeptical. Okay. But he gradually, he gradually started to see the blocks energy working.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.200]   So he came around. He did, eventually. Yeah. Wow. That's really cool.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.280]   Yeah. And another person said that their daughter would just intuitively place her crystal in the
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.840]   block. Oh, wow. Like she instinctively knew. Interesting. And there's a few testimonials where
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.280]   people talk about charging their food and water with the blocks. Yes. And noticing a
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.200]   difference in taste and effect. Yeah. And there's even one where a woman, she used the block to
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.560]   support her friend during a court case. What? And the case was dismissed.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.440]   Wow. That's wild. It is wild. Okay. So moving on to product category two, capsules.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.480]   Okay. So Leela Q offers a range of capsules, the heel capsule, the Olympic capsule,
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.720]   and the women's booster to name a few. Right. What can you tell us about the capsules?
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.280]   Well, people are reporting, you know, a variety of benefits from the capsules,
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.400]   just like they did with the blocks. People say they have more energy, less fatigue,
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.880]   pain relief, and they're recovering faster from illnesses. Okay.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.920]   People also mentioned, you know, that they feel more mentally clear, they can focus better,
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:04.000]   they feel emotionally balanced. And some people even say that they are protected from EMF.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.080]   Really? Yeah. Well, one of the testimonials that really stood out to me was a woman who
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.920]   said that she felt a stronger connection to her partner after she exchanged a capsule ball with
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:24.080]   him. Oh, wow. Yeah. That's interesting. And there's also a man who had a bone spur and nerve damage,
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.920]   and he said that his pain was reduced after using the heel capsule.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.160]   And then there are a couple of athletes, a tennis player,
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.360]   said that he noticed his performance was improved when he was using a specific capsule and frequency
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.960]   setting. Interesting. And then a pickleball player said that it was like she was seeing the
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.800]   bowl in slow motion when she was wearing a particular capsule and frequency combination.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.920]   It's fascinating. It really is. How these capsules seem to, you know,
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.960]   enhance performance and deepen connections. Yeah. That's, that's really neat. Yeah.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:05.120]   Okay. So now let's move on to product category three, frequency cards and quantum upgrade.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:12.000]   Okay. So what are people saying about those? So the frequency cards, they're designed to give
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.120]   you targeted support for specific things like focus, abundance, protection, and emotional well-being.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.800]   Interesting. And people are, you know, they're experiencing these benefits when they use the
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.760]   cards. Yeah. And one person even talked about manifesting the exact amount of money that they
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:33.120]   needed for a travel block after using the abundance card. Yes. That's a, that's a good one. Yeah.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.400]   And then others mentioned using specific frequencies for, you know, improving sleep
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.880]   and relieving anxiety. And there's even one parent who said that their daughter, who has ADHD,
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:51.360]   showed improvement in focus and willingness to put an effort and goal setting after using
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:57.120]   the focus frequency card. That's incredible. Yeah, it is. And then quantum upgrade or QU
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.000]   seems to be a more comprehensive approach. Right. It's, it's creating a field of quantum energy
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   in a space. It is. So what are people saying about QU? So people say they feel more spiritually
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.480]   connected. They feel like the EMFs in their homes are being harmonized. Okay. And they just feel,
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.040]   they just feel better overall. Okay. And there's, there's one guy who said that he felt this like
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.080]   negative energy lift from his house after he activated the QU field. And he said that his
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.600]   mental clarity was enhanced. Interesting. Yeah. Okay. And lastly, product category four,
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.000]   other Leela Q products. Right. So we've got things like quantum underwear, bamboo water bottles,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.720]   and dog collars. Yeah. Not a ton of these in the testimonials. But what are people saying about?
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:46.240]   Well, there aren't as many, you know, testimonials about these. But, but there are some positive
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.320]   experiences. One man said that he felt more grounded when he was wearing the quantum underwear.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.280]   Oh, yeah. One woman said that her plans were growing exceptionally well after she watered
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:03.760]   them with water that had been charged in a Leela Q water bottle. Wow. And one person even said that
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.520]   their dog who had behavioral issues became calmer after wearing a Leela Q collar.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:15.200]   Oh, wow. Yeah. So it's, it's limited, but there's, there's definitely some evidence that these
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:21.360]   products can have positive effects beyond the main product categories. That's really cool. Yeah.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.280]   Wow. We've covered a lot of ground already. So let's, let's dive a little deeper into some of
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:30.640]   these experiences in part two. Sounds good. You know, as we, as we look more closely at these
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.200]   testimonials, you know, there are some themes that really stand out. And, and one of the biggest
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.640]   ones is this sense of personal transformation and growth that people are talking about. Okay.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.320]   You know, it's not just about feeling better physically. Right. We're getting specific results.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:52.080]   Right. But, but there's this shift in overall well-being and, and self-awareness that people
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.480]   describe. That's interesting. Yeah. They, they talk about feeling more connected to themselves,
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:02.800]   okay, more in tune with their intuition, and even a sense of, of purpose, you know, and, and it's
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:10.000]   almost like, um, the products are acting like, like catalysts. Okay. For, for deeper, self-discovery,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.600]   yeah, personal evolution, you know. Yeah. And there was one, um, one testimonial that really
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.800]   stood out to me, where, where the person said that they felt like they were, like, peeling back
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:26.880]   layers of themselves. Oh, wow. You know? Yeah. And, and uncovering this hidden potential. Mm-hmm.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.400]   And, and they were addressing these emotional wounds that they had had for a long time. That's
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.400]   powerful. It is really powerful. Yeah. And then, and then there's another person who said that,
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.400]   um, it was like they were becoming the person they were meant to be all along, you know. Yeah. Like
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.600]   they were, they were finally aligning with their true self. Exactly. Yeah. That's amazing. And then
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.880]   another big theme that I noticed was, um, the role of intention. Yes.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.320]   Inshooping experiences with the products. Absolutely. A lot of people emphasized, um,
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.520]   you know, setting clear intentions. Right. Whether it was for healing or abundance,
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:09.360]   or enhanced performance, or deeper connections. Yeah. It seems like intention really is key here.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.760]   It really does. Like it's, it's guiding the energy of the products. Okay.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.000]   Towards specific goals. Yeah. And the more intentional you are, the more,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   the more profound the results seem to be. That makes sense. Yeah. Um, and there was one, uh,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.720]   one example where this person put a picture of a project that was stalled. Okay. And their
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.600]   block with the intention of peacefully resolving the situation. Mm. And, and they said that they
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.560]   started getting responses from people who had been ignoring them. Wow. So it, it really worked.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:47.440]   Yeah. It seemed to. Yeah. That's amazing. And then, um, there was another person who manifested the
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.440]   exact amount of money. They needed for a travel block. Wow. After using the abundance card with a
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.880]   very clear intention. That's incredible. It's really incredible. Yeah. Um, and then beyond,
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:04.720]   beyond individual experiences, there are several testimonials that talk about the impact of the
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:10.080]   products on relationships. Interesting. One other people. For example, one person said that they're
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:16.720]   home where they had an infinity block. Yeah. Became this space where, where even people who were
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:22.640]   normally negative became more positive and joyful. So it was like the, the energy of the block was,
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.120]   was affecting everyone in the house. Exactly. Yeah. That's fascinating. And then, and then we
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:32.080]   have the testimonial about the woman who felt a stronger connection to her partner. Right. After
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.480]   exchanging a capsule ball with him. Yeah. That one was really interesting. It seems like these
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:42.240]   products can really deepen connections. Yeah. And I also noticed that there were a few
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:50.320]   testimonials about animals benefiting from the products. Oh, really? Yeah. That's cool. There
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.200]   weren't a ton of them. Right. But, but it seems like the, the positive effects might extend to
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.400]   animals as well. That makes sense. Yeah. If it's, if it's working on an energetic level, right? Yeah.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.680]   It could, it could affect, you know, all living things. Yeah. That's really interesting. Yeah.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.360]   It seems like we're only just beginning to understand the full potential of this technology.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.560]   I think you're right. Yeah. These testimonials are really fascinating.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.480]   They are. They're really insightful. As we wrap up our deep dive into these
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:23.680]   Leela quantum product testimonials, it's, it's really clear that people are having all sorts of
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.680]   experiences. Definitely. You know, from, from physical benefits, right, to, to these more subtle
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.800]   shifts and, and how they feel and, and how they see the world. Absolutely. And, and it's important
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:40.080]   to remember that this is, you know, this is still a new field. Right. And, and we need more research
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.520]   to really understand how it all works. Yeah. But it is fascinating to see these, these common
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.960]   themes. Yeah. You know, across so many different people. You know, it, it seems like these products
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   could really help people grow. Yeah. I think so. And, and become more, more aware of themselves.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.640]   Absolutely. And, and you know, that whole thing about intention. Oh, yeah. That's, that's really
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:09.280]   interesting to me. It is. It really seems like, like our thoughts and beliefs and, and our intentions,
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:14.960]   you know, they, they have a much bigger impact on our reality than, than we maybe realized before.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.320]   Yeah, for sure. And, and the potential applications of this technology, I mean, it's huge. It's huge.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:25.920]   It's, it could be, you know, yeah, way beyond just, you know, feeling better. It could be, you know,
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.720]   affecting our relationships. Yeah. Our environment, even, you know, how we understand consciousness
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:37.440]   itself. Yeah. That's, that's amazing. It is pretty mind-blowing. It really is. But, you know, we,
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.000]   we do need to be careful. Of course. And, and remember that, you know, everyone's experience
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.080]   is different. Right. And, and these products, they aren't meant to replace, you know, seeing a doctor
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:54.320]   or, or getting professional help. Exactly. And, and like with any new technology, we need to be
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.480]   smart. Absolutely. And, and responsible. We need to keep learning. Yes. And, and talking about it.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.240]   Yeah. So we can, we can figure out how to, how to use it in the best way possible.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.960]   Exactly. Well, thanks for joining us on this deep dive into the world of Leela quantum products.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.840]   Yeah. Thanks for having me. We hope you found it informative. I hope so.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.400]   And maybe even a little inspiring. You too. And, and who knows? Maybe you'll even try out some
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:23.200]   of these products yourself. That would be great. Yeah. All right. That's it for this episode. We'll
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.080]   see you next time. See you then. So there you go. Thank you so much for listening. I hope you found
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:34.160]   that informational and interesting. I certainly did. I thought it was a great way to summarize the
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:38.480]   information to kind of share with people. You know, the just like, Hey, here's all this data, but,
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.760]   you know, not dumping pages of information on you or forcing you to scroll through the thing to kind
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.600]   of figure out, you know, what, you know, what people are experiencing. But there you go in a
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.960]   nice little condensed little fashion 15 minute, you know, podcast. I thought it was a really
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:58.000]   great way to approach the data. I hope you did too. It's interesting. Not only is it fascinating
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.600]   that so many people are experiencing such great benefits from their blocks and capsules and so
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.880]   forth. But it's also really amazing, honestly, where AI is going now. Because what you just heard
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.240]   was not humid. They were just two AI characters who read a bunch of data and then started talking
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.880]   about it. And that's fascinating. But you know, even more fascinating, though, is the incredible
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:24.080]   benefits of Leila quantum tech. So I just want to say, thank you for being a customer. Thank you
