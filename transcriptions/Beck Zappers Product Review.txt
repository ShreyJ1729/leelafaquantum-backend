[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and this video
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:13.920]   is a product review of Beck Zappers otherwise known as Bob Beck Zappers and/or Blood Electrifiers
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.480]   for the purpose of blood electrification. So I've got several of these things myself. I wanted
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.440]   to share with you the differences between them, explain the basics on how to use it and where you
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.920]   can get yours. So if you're interested in that material, let me just jump in real quick and throw
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.360]   some disclaimers at you. This video is absolutely not medical advice, blah, blah, blah, no affiliation.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.320]   Oh, and I have no affiliation with any products mentioned. I don't sell them. I don't, I don't
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.320]   affiliate for them. But there are some cautions you should be aware if you're going to decide to do
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.600]   the Beck protocol and or just doing blood electrification all by itself. The first thing is,
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.200]   you know, it is a microcurrent device. So anytime you use anything that's going to put electrical
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.440]   current and voltage into your body, if you have electrical implants, don't do it. Okay, there's just
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.240]   absolutely no reason to take a risk. If you've got a device inside your body somewhere that runs on
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.760]   electricity, you certainly don't want to be zapping yourself with electricity in the event that you
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.240]   could possibly hurt and or damage whatever's in you. So just that's just absolutely not recommended.
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.920]   The other thing too, there's just not enough research. And the fact there's no research that I've ever
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.640]   seen about using blood electrification devices and parasite zappers on pregnant people and people in
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.600]   super ill health who just don't have the ability to to manage a detox reaction. And now also too,
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.200]   the scars are problematic with current flow in the body. Just be aware of that. Now from a
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.040]   standpoint of probe placement, this only comes into play if you decide to get creative. But if you
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.400]   stick with the standard risk placement, you should be fine. And the other thing too about the zappers
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.120]   is that there's an issue called transfection that you really need to be aware about. Bob Beck was
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.000]   very adamant and very vocal about being cautious of this issue. And what that means simply is that
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.240]   when you pump electrical current into your body, specifically into your blood, I mean, even more so
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.360]   in your blood, what it does is it creates a situation called electroporation of your of your cells.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.120]   And what that means is that it's it basically think about it this way, you know, a ping pong ball
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.280]   versus a golf ball. Okay, how a ping pong ball is completely smooth all the way around. That's
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.880]   that's an analogy of what any one of your cells is. And the and the exterior of the ping pong ball
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.480]   obviously is your cell wall now or membrane. Now the the thing about electricity is when it actually
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.320]   when you're subjecting your body to electricity, this thing, this this action called electroporation
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.520]   occurs. And it basically causes divots in your cellular membrane. Okay, and then so then it starts
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.400]   to look like a golf ball with all these little divots in it. And every one of those little divots
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.200]   in your cell membrane is a thinning of the membrane wall. And what that allows or what that causes
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.520]   is that anything that is in your blood or anything that's in your lymphatic system that's that's going
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.600]   to come into contact with that cell or those cells that have been electroprated is going to be able
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.480]   to get inside that cell a lot easier because the membranes are thinned out. That's that's my
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.040]   elevator pitch for that. In other words, what Bob Beck recommended was don't take pharmaceuticals,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.200]   don't take strong supplements, don't take don't take anything within an hour before and several
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.680]   hours after zapping because it because your cells are able to absorb much more from their environment
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.160]   to give you an example that I believe he stated in one of his lectures that, you know, if you drink
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.920]   one beer and while you're zapping, it's like drinking 10 beers. And so in that goes with
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.360]   everything that's going to be in your bloodstream. So be very careful about pharmaceuticals, alcohol,
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.880]   anything else you could have in your body one hour before and two hours after until the
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.400]   electroporation effect of your cells diminishes and you go back to normal. So it's called
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.280]   transfection and take it seriously. Now for best results using microcurrent devices,
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.400]   which includes zappers is optimal hydration and mineralization is required. This is electricity.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.520]   And you know, if you're not well hydrated, you're not well mineralized, the electricity just won't
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.760]   flow very well or as well in your body. And so you just want to be an optimal condition for,
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.600]   you know, conductivity, electrical conductivity. And you just want to be hydrated and mineralized.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.520]   Okay, last thing to is when you're using probes, electrodes on your skin in any form or any,
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.520]   you know, manner whatsoever, you want to have clean skin, you want the absolute less or the least
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.240]   amount of, you know, of, I guess, barrier between the probe and your skin. Okay, so just having it
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.160]   clean. And also having clean probes, make sure your electrodes are clean. If you have metal
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.200]   electrodes, it's really good just to take a scrubby and polish them up and get the, you know, get all
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.280]   that tarnish off of them. Other probes don't need that. But if you're using metal probes,
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.920]   definitely keep them clean and remove the tarnish. Again, you don't want anything, you want the
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.240]   least amount of stuff between the actual electrode and your skin. So make sure your probes are clean
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.120]   and your skin is clean. Now in terms of what is a back zapper, for those of you who aren't
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:46.240]   aren't familiar with it, I did an entire, I did two entire videos about the Bob Beck protocol and
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.840]   specifically about, and one that was specifically about blood electrification. And that's what it is.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.520]   A back zapper is a blood electrifier for the purposes of blood electrification. And what,
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.000]   and there's a whole science behind it. There's a couple of guys in the Einstein, some Einstein
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.760]   hospital or something in New York. I forget it's in the video. Anyway, these two guys discovered
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.440]   that in their, and they did a patent on it, and then Bob Beck took it and developed and
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.040]   commercialized it. But the idea was quite simply, is that, you know, these scientists discovered
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:28.480]   that when you subject your blood to a certain level of voltage, a certain level of milliamps
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.400]   current or like mill, you know, millicurrent, you know, microcurrent, right, and, and frequency,
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.720]   that the effect on pathogens was a, was it, it didn't kill them, it stunned them.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.800]   And in, in this so that they were not able to then go and affect yourselves. In other words,
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.120]   it's like a stun gun on pathogens, it disables them, and then your, then your body then naturally
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.760]   then would flush it out, like it normally would, like, you know, your, your blood gets clean through
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.200]   your liver, etc, you know, your lymphatic system and urinary system and all that is going to then
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:09.760]   purge all that stuff out. So it was originally designed now to treat HIV. This is what Bob Beck
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.200]   decided to do was he originally designed this to treat HIV because this was back in the 80s,
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.360]   when HIV was the, you know, was the pandemic of the day, and it worked really, really, really well.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.200]   He actually spent a lot of money. He went outside of the US, did clinical trials all by himself,
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:33.360]   came back a ton of data. Unfortunately, he never published that data, but he clearly stipulated
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.160]   that, you know, he had done multiple clinical trials with HIV patients to try to, you know,
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.320]   help them because at the time there was nothing to treat these guys, if you're, if you're old enough
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.600]   to remember. And so he was very successful at it. And numerous HIV patients were cured
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:55.920]   using the Bob Beck protocol as, as, as a whole protocol. But this particular thing, the zapper,
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:02.320]   is simply one step of the multiple steps of the protocol. But you can, and this is the thing about
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:09.200]   blood electrification is I use mine all the time just by itself. And I only do the whole protocol
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.120]   if I ever get sick, which I rarely get sick. So I just kind of just do just, I just do blood
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.160]   electrification all the time. And I do it specifically now, more so just to fight off an infection,
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.520]   if I were to have some small wound, or large wound as well. And I also do it for detoxing. So
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.480]   that's what it does. It eliminates the pathogens in your blood, and it does it, and it does it really
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:36.960]   well. And so when I mean pathogens, I mean bacteria, viruses, molds, fungi, you know, if you have ever
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.840]   looked at videos of people's bloods, you know, there's a lot more floating around in there than
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.840]   just the blood cells, right? There's a white blood cell and a red blood cell. Well, all that other
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.240]   stuff that you see in the video of, you know, when you're doing dark field microscopy, that's all
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.680]   pathogens. And so this is what will get rid of that. So a lot of people who have mold issues,
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:03.280]   this is a perfect modality to use in terms of blood electrification to detox from that mold.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.840]   I highly recommend that. Now, as I mentioned, fighting infections, I have been using
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:14.400]   Beck's zappers for almost 20 years. And I've used it every single time when I would have otherwise
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:21.120]   gone to an alopath and been prescribed antibiotics, which I do not take. And 100% of the time,
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:30.160]   I have absolutely cured any issue that I've had with an infected wound. And even an abscess,
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:34.800]   you know, like you'd get an abscess in your tooth or something, which I've done. And so, yeah,
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:40.080]   this works 100% of the time for me. I don't take antibiotics. Instead, I use the zapper.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:46.640]   It's a drug free, no side effect approach towards fighting infections. And also, again,
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.680]   it's great for pathogen detox, which is what I primarily do now. So that's what this zapper does.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:59.440]   It does blood electrification. It is one part of a multi step Beck protocol. And it is an incredible
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:06.320]   tool that I really highly recommend everybody look into and have one at home. They're not that
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.840]   expensive. And they do remarkable at what they're supposed to do. So now, let's talk about the
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:18.480]   different types of Beck zappers. Now, there's three basic types of zappers. And one is just the
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:24.160]   single purpose. All it does. And this is a couple of examples of single purpose Beck zappers.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:30.640]   And the prices you'll find today out there online. And what it does is what these devices do,
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:36.080]   their single purpose. They only do blood electrification. And using the schematic that
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.600]   Dr. Bob Beck had created, which by the way, he open sourced it. He didn't want the pharma
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.320]   companies to grab it, put a patent on it, and then, you know, and then hide it from the world and
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:52.560]   or charge people, you know, hundreds of dollars for the treatment. Instead, he open sourced it. He
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.680]   lists. He came up with the idea. He invented the device. He threw it out there on the internet
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.040]   for anyone to build. And so you've got a lot of independent people building them. And you've
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.400]   also got companies who completely commercialize it as a product. So if you get a quote, if you look
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.800]   at one of these things, and it's got a single jack and it just does Beck zapping, then that's
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.680]   all it does is blood electrification. It's a single purpose zapper. Now, there's a thing called a
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:24.240]   dual purpose zapper, which is what the Beck protocol, you know, it kind of was meant for the
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.600]   Beck protocol specifically, instead of just for blood electrification. And one really good example
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.880]   of that is a product that I'll show you in the demo video in a second called the soda instruments
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:40.560]   silver pulsor. Now that silver pulsor was the original one. It runs around 295, but they have
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:47.120]   now as of last year, they came out with a silver pulsor light model. And that sells for 150. So
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.240]   it's a really great bargain in terms of, you know, being able to get an actual Beck protocol zapper.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.600]   And what I mean by that is that part of the protocol is to, you know, is to take
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:04.960]   total silver while you're zapping. And so what these dual purpose zappers do is it not only provides
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:12.480]   the blood electrification, you know, feature, but it also has a feature. So you can use the same zapper
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.480]   to create your clodal silver before you start zapping so you can combine the two. So you basically
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.640]   have a Beck zapper combined with a clodal silver maker. And that's the dual purpose. And there's
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.840]   also this other one called the combos. Now, because you know, it's it's open source, people have been
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:35.440]   building these things for years. And so they've combined it with other modalities. And so you
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:41.200]   get end up getting a Beck zapper. That's a con that's a combination of other types of modalities.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.040]   So here's one right here on the left side. It's this from altered states. Now they've
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.480]   built one. And that it's all a Beck zapper. It's a Bob Beck zapper. But it's also got
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:56.960]   hold a clock, Clark frequencies, if you're familiar with Dr. Hold a Clark, who's another very famous
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:03.280]   alternative doctor in the parasite, you know, you know, detox environment. And so she came up with
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:09.760]   her own modalities, her own she's written several books, all really great stuff, highly recommend.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:16.160]   And so her focus was completely on parasites. Whereas Beck was completely on pathogens,
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.200]   which is, you know, so they're they're on the same team, but they came at it from different
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   perspectives. So the hold a Clark zapper has different features or different modes that are
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.920]   specific to parasites now. And that's parasites living everywhere else in your body outside of
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:38.880]   your blood. So now they've taken altered states is the maker of this model. It's called the bioelectric
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:45.440]   pulser. So it does Beck zapping hold a clock, Clark zapping. It does magnetic pulsing. And it
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.560]   also makes the collodal silver generator. And now this is a little bit more pricey. It's 350. For
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.680]   obvious reasons, it's got a lot more features in it. Now there's other combos out there. There's
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:03.840]   one by a guy they call his line of products is called the para zappers. And then there's this one
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:09.040]   here from a company from a guy, his name is Michael Forrester. And he's got three or four different
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:15.680]   models. And he combines the Beck zapping with other frequencies you can use, including up to
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:21.760]   and including Clark zapping frequencies. The para zapper is by far the most comprehensive combo
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:28.400]   out there. And I think it provides up to I think 30 or more. I mean, there's just a whole list of
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:35.120]   all of these different modes you could try in terms of zapping, including Beck. And so now you can see
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:42.160]   where the base model is 176. It goes up to 459 for the most, you know, a comprehensive, you know,
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.880]   device that they sell at that website at the pair zapper website. And then of course you got
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.560]   Mike Forrester is also kind of referred to as dragonfly. And the dragonfly zappers go from 125
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:59.520]   to 175. So, you know, it's all really relatively inexpensive, in my opinion. And you've got multiple
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.160]   choices on what you want to do. And so that's when you don't obviously when you're picking a zapper
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.200]   and you want to try one or buy one, you know, you just keep in mind what you know what you need it
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.480]   for. So real quick, though, I do want to point out there's this issue about electroplacement.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.320]   And so really, you know, it's just this little box, right, you've got a little box or a little
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.840]   handheld unit. And the way you do it is you just take your, you take your probe, which is just a
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.600]   cord plugs into your zapper, and then you put the probes on either side of your wrist right above
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:36.000]   your main arteries going into your hand. And then one of the ways that the universe created us was
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.800]   we have two main arteries into our hand, in case one gets severed, your hand still works. It's one
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:46.800]   of those evolutionary things. And so you want to find both of them, you know, with like taking a pulse,
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:53.680]   find them, put the electrode above that, wet the sleeve that it's in, strap it on and turn on your
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:59.920]   zapper. That's really it. Now this is the way that Beck told everybody to use it. But there's
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.360]   also another way we can put the probe up, you know, just basically place it along this a single
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:13.920]   arterial, you know, company arterial artery coming into your hand. Okay, but the main thing is this,
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:20.400]   the reason he picked this area is it's because it's the closest place on your body, where you can put
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:26.480]   something on your skin, where the current will pulse through there, not pulse, but be, you know,
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:32.000]   basically broadcast through your bloodstream. Everywhere else, you know, we're all kind of thick.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.640]   So right there on your wrist is the closest place where you're going to get the best optimal,
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:42.640]   you know, zapping of your bloodstream is on your wrist. Now there's also a main artery on,
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:47.680]   on your ankle that's also used by some people. So the whole idea though, is this is the basic
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.480]   way of doing it. This is how I do it. But other people have gotten creative over the years. So I
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:58.320]   wanted to just point that out in terms of they place two probes along along one artery. They place,
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:04.480]   there's people that do placing one probe on each wrist along the main artery, which is this big one
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:11.680]   right here near your thumb. There's also people that'll do one wrist and then one on their ankle
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.800]   at the other artery so that they're doing a pulsing across their entire body, you know. So there's
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.920]   different ways to do it. I just want to point out though that this is the, you know, the basic way,
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:28.640]   the mainstream way of doing it if you were to refer to that way. And the key thing about the
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.560]   probe placement, you know, obviously is like, hey, if you do one on your leg and one on your wrist,
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.280]   you're a mobile, you're not walking around. I mean, it's, you know, and this comes down to ease of use,
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.640]   but what's effective is this way. And I recommend it. It just works for me and I've never had an
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.760]   issue with it. So that's that there. Now in terms of trying to pick one out, you know, again, you
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.240]   want to just what's your objective? If you just want to do blood electrification, then, you know,
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:57.280]   go for a cheap single use model. If you want to do the back protocol, get to do a purpose one,
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.040]   of course, and if you want to do a lot more, you want to tinker around and figure out, you know,
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:06.000]   try different things, then definitely a combo model will work for you. And so that's there.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.080]   And then your budget, according, you know, is whatever you can afford. And then the last thing,
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.400]   too, I want to point out, and this is going to be in my demo video coming up, it's just the ease of
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:19.280]   use. Now all of these different devices, and I have four of them for different models. Now,
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:23.360]   all of these different devices, you know, they have different accessories, they have different
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.000]   types of probes, they have different conveniences, they have different, you know, model, you know,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.120]   basically, you know, how to use them, how to use the device. And so there's a huge issue about,
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:38.240]   you know, ease of use and maintenance that, you know, that really is comes up. And I cover that
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.600]   in a video. And lastly, too, I do cover one more time, the quality of electrodes, you know, and so
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.680]   it really, really is important that you've got good electrodes. If you don't have good electrodes,
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:52.160]   they're not going to, you know, zap very well, and the machine and the device won't work as well
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:57.680]   for you. So there you go. So let's go ahead and go through the demo video and give you some,
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.880]   you know, idea of what the differences are. And then we'll take it from there.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.200]   Okay, let's talk Beck Zappers or otherwise known as blood electrification,
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:18.480]   which then resulted in Dr. Beck inventing what he called the blood electrification device. Also,
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:26.160]   then became the quote Beck Zapper. Its primary purpose is to purify your blood of pathogens.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:31.680]   And I've got a whole video explaining how blood electrification works. So these are the devices
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.080]   that I that I own that I've been tinkering around with. And I just kind of want to walk you through
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:41.280]   the pluses and minuses of them. So you kind of have an idea if you're out there looking for
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:46.960]   a Beck Zapper for yourself. These are some choices. Okay. So the very first one here now,
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:53.120]   this is my oldest one. This goes back, I don't know, 15, 20 years. But this came from a company
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.920]   called Silver Smoke Research. They're no longer around. I'm just sharing this to kind of show
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:04.000]   you the evolution. But you know, these were all really designed before they got commercialized,
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.200]   like you'll see in the next couple of other devices. But you know, basically tinker's were
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.000]   basically creating these things at home and selling them on eBay. And so this year, your typical,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.560]   you know, electronics project box. And he basically put the circuitry in here. And you can kind of
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.760]   see from inside this thing. But there's your breadboard and all the circuitry that the guy made. It
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:31.200]   runs on three nine volt batteries. And like I said, I've had this about, I don't know, 15, 20 years.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:38.400]   And this is my go to, this is seriously my go to. I love this thing. It's a workhorse. It's never
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:44.880]   broken down ever. And so I ended up getting a couple of them. And so I took out the circuitry
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:50.720]   out of the box and I put it in this little satchel, this little bag. And then the reason I did it
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:56.800]   was that I could put an arm band on it. So right now, I pretty much use this one the most because I
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:02.800]   can strap it right to my arm with the electrodes coming to my wrist. And it just allows me to just,
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.280]   you know, keep doing chores and whatever I need to do while I'm zapping. So yeah, this is probably
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.200]   one of the best ones out there. But unfortunately, you can't buy one anymore. But I kind of wanted
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.360]   to show you that, you know, years and years and years have gone by, I've actually ended up making
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:21.040]   my own probes. So it just basically uses, and all of them use a, you know, the one eighth inch jack.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:26.720]   Now you plug it in, this model itself had the zapper output. And then also it has the
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:33.120]   for making collodal silver outputs. You can, it's a dual purpose device for both purposes.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:40.560]   I've made my own probes over time using just pure silver wire. And of course, you know, the
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:46.800]   cord, the, the strap. Now all of the, if you know, all of these electrodes need to be covered with
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:53.680]   this really disgusting, I probably need to watch cotton sleeve. So this is a piece of cotton,
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:59.280]   somebody's t-shirt, sewed up into a little sleeve, and you put the probe in the sleeve,
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:05.680]   wet it down, and then put it in, in, in, in place on your wrist. And then there's this little cheap
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.560]   nut, you know, strap to hold it in. So it's a real rinky dig, Mickey Mouse old school. I think I
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:15.120]   don't even, I don't remember paying more than 100 bucks for this, but it works and it works great.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.840]   So then going to the next model now, this is from a guy, I believe in Slovakia or Romania or
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.880]   something like that. His name is Bosedar. And so when he originally came on the scene about a
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:30.480]   decade ago, he actually was selling Beck Zapper kits and you could buy the kit. And so I bought one,
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:37.200]   thinking that I was a electronically assembly gifted enough to go ahead and get a soldering
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.840]   iron and put it together. And of course, you can see this bag still sitting there after 10 plus
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:49.040]   years to show you how much I really care about electronic assembly. But anyway,
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.840]   eventually came out with this, which he started actually selling the device itself.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:57.760]   And so I called this, you know, there's really no name for it, but the website is like, you know,
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.840]   electronic kit complete because that's how he started selling kits. But then he started
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.960]   selling the completed model. And so I just call this my Bosedar. Now this is a single purpose
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:13.120]   Beck Zapper. It's only got one output check and that's just to zap. It works fairly okay.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:18.960]   The thing about this is whenever I buy anything, I usually buy two of them, one I keep and one
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:24.400]   I give to the kids so that, you know, she's been trained. And so I gave her one and hers didn't
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:29.280]   work. Mine worked. So, you know, this does zap, mind this. So it's got a 50/50 chance of it working.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:35.920]   And the thing though, I don't like about this and I don't recommend is because he uses these.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.720]   So unless you're going to make your own probe, so he gives you these little rust, you know,
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.040]   they end up rusting because it's been 10 years, right? You can see the rest on it. But I guess
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.000]   it's kind of not totally stainless steel if it's rusting or tarnishing. But these are the probes
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.040]   that he uses. So he basically gives you the cord and the probe. And you can see right here that,
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:00.560]   you know, this is how it fits into the rear end of the little probe. And while it's nice that it's
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.440]   big, right? Because it's a lot easier to work with than just a fricking piece of wire in terms of,
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:12.880]   you know, placement on your wrist. The problem is if you notice, it falls out really easy. This
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:19.280]   thing pops out so easy. It drives me nuts trying to use it because it would constantly unplug
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.720]   and so I just really hate using this one. So I don't recommend the Bozadar. Even though it's cheap,
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.880]   it's like 89 bucks. But maybe that's why you get what you pay for, right? Again, it comes with the
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.920]   little cotton sleeves except he's using felt and the cheap old wrist snap. And that's kind of the
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:40.880]   Bozadar. Now, this other one here, this is from a guy called his name is Michael Forrester. And I
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:46.320]   forgot the name of his website, but it's it's dragonflies in the URL. I'll give all the links in the
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:55.040]   video description. This guy was interesting. He's another do I DIY build his own in in his house,
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:59.600]   and he then sells them online. And so the unique thing about this Beck zapper from, I would just
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:09.120]   call it dragonfly, Michael Forrester, was that he not only put in the four Hertz, it's 3.95 Hertz
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:16.320]   for Beck, right? So you get a X number of milliamps. So you just set it at four Hertz right here, DC
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:22.800]   on, and then turn up the volume, right? It's got those singular Jacks. So it's a single purpose
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:30.880]   Beck zapper. But then in this mode, it is a Beck zapper. But he also added on the AC converter in
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:37.040]   there. So you could try AC if you want it. You can also go 40 Hertz or 10 Hertz. So he kind of added a
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.680]   couple extra frequencies in there. If you want to play around with it, every one of these frequencies
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:47.440]   have different healing modalities, but four Hertz or 3.95 is is what the Beck zapper does. So this is
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:53.360]   what he put out. And for this puppy, geez, I don't remember what I paid for it, but it was it was
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:58.880]   like 200 bucks or something. The thing about this guy, and the reason that I don't recommend this
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:04.800]   one either, and it's not a bad device, is just unless you make your own probes. Okay, I recommend
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:10.560]   if you get this, you make your own probes, because this is what he provides for probes.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:15.440]   It's just denim. It's just a square of denim. And look how big this is when compared to your
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:22.480]   wrist, right? And so because of this square of denim, you basically take these are the probes
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:28.560]   instead of using metal, right? You're using a piece of denim, you wet it, put it on your wrist,
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:34.320]   and then you plug this into the device, and then you then use your little alligator clips,
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:40.000]   and then you clamp onto that piece of denim, right? And that's it. Now, of course, he did provide
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.560]   two little denim sleeves if you want to go ahead and get probes, and or buy probes, make probes,
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.440]   right, to be able to use with the device. But if you don't do that, you're stuck with using these,
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:57.600]   and I'm telling you, I tried it once, and it sucked. It really, it was just, I don't recommend it,
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:03.680]   because it stings like L, because you are literally zapping your entire wrist instead of two places
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.480]   on your wrist, which is all Beck wanted you to do, and that's part of the protocol. So, yeah,
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:14.240]   really dropped the ball on the probe thing, Mike, sorry to say, but you know, it's a good device,
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.880]   this by itself, great device probe, and you need to think that one through, you need to, you know,
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.880]   and you need better, it needs to be better, way better. And then of course, it doesn't even come
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:28.720]   with a strap, it just, this is it. So, I'm not recommended this one either, because most people
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:34.240]   want to plug and play, which leads me to the best plug and play out there, the absolute pinnacle
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:40.160]   of Beck zappers that you want to get, is called the Soda Silver Pulsor. Now, these puppies back in
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:46.160]   the day, I think I paid, I don't know, like under 300, but it was up in the high 200s, right? Now,
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:51.840]   they actually have a silver pulsor light version, which I haven't looked into what the difference is,
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:57.600]   but it's a lot cheaper now, under 200, the light mop. So, this puppy right here is made by
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:06.240]   that guy, Rob, I forgot his last name, but from Soda Instruments, he's actually one of Bob Beck's,
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:12.320]   you know, you know, acquaintances back in the day, and so he was the one entrusted by Bob to go
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:17.040]   ahead and commercialize the blood electrifier. So, this is the commercialized blood electrifier
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:26.240]   that Bob designed, and Rob created. It is also a dual, it is a dual model, dual module, sorry,
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:32.880]   dual mode, dual purpose zapper. So, not only can you plug it in, so this is the input jack right
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.960]   here, like there, and that plugs right into this little jack right there, and that's where you get
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:42.320]   your probes. Their probes are really, really nice. They're basically some kind of plastic wrapped
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:48.080]   around the metal, so the metal is not touching your skin. Nice touch, comes with the little felt
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:56.160]   sleeves. Not so fancy wristband, I mean, everybody needs to work on their wristbands, but it works,
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.880]   but the nice part about it though is this guy right here. The probes are really, really nice,
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.040]   and they don't burn you. And then, of course, the other jack right here, if you wanted to,
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:10.480]   then this jack right there is for the power, if you want to connect the power, it's the only one
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.960]   that comes with an AC jack. So, if you don't want to use batteries, you can do that. And then this
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:20.480]   thing can zap and also make collodal silver, and you set it into silver mode, and you would need to
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:27.440]   get a different probe for that. It's somewhere in the bag. This is the, this is the little case that
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:33.040]   it comes in, and silver pulser. And somewhere in this little baggie right in here, I didn't pull it
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.760]   out, is the stuff that you would need to make collodal silver. And so, you can make collodal silver
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:43.680]   with this. You can do back zapping with this, and the thing that's great about this in addition to
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.720]   these really, really nice probes. And by the way, when you, and the, the reason that this thing is
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:54.880]   Velcro is that the sleeves stick to the, to the, to the strap. And I tell you, you know, it's really
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.320]   a silly little thing, but that's a huge deal. That way you're, you know, your, your sleeves aren't
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.480]   slipping around, and they just stay put. Once you fit it to your wrist where you know what you want
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:10.080]   to put stuff, it, it just stays there. And all you got to do is put it back on, slide the probes in,
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:15.040]   make sure they're wet, and off you go. It's so easy to use. But the thing again, the other thing I
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:20.160]   really love about it is this guy right here, this is the arm band. Now the silver pulser on the back,
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:25.760]   you see this little hook thing? It hooks right into the arm band. So you don't have to get super fancy
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:30.160]   like this. It's made for that. So you can wear it on your arm. And let me tell you, you know,
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.880]   when you're doing this thing for two hours, you're going to want to move around, you know, scratch
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:40.240]   your face, whatever. I mean, it's so helpful to have the ability to wear the zapper because you're
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.360]   wearing it. You're using it for so long. So I, you know, my go to recommend now that the, you know,
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:51.040]   the silver smokes are gone. They don't exist anymore. I recommend the soda silver pulser.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.760]   They're a company in Canada. You can find it on eBay. You can find it on Amazon, shop around.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:01.520]   Sometimes you get a really great deal on a used one for, you know, great price. So that's my
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.920]   recommend. They're also, you know, are, you know, there obviously are other manufacturers out there
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.160]   making zappers. These are the ones that I bought. These are the ones that I've tried. And so this
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:16.160]   is my opinion. Don't flame me if you, you're the rep for this company. I don't know. Anyway,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:21.360]   there you go. That's Beck Zappers. All right. So there you go. So thank you very much for watching
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:26.160]   the video. Hope this was helpful and educational for you. I know, you know, all of this stuff is
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:30.320]   kind of confusing if you've never done it before. And probably most people have never even realized
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:35.760]   there's different types of big zappers. So anyway, I just want to say, hey, thanks. I hope you enjoyed
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:40.960]   this or at least got something out of it. If you want to learn more about me, I'm here at the
