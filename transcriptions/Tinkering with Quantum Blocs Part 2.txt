[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another tinker's Academy video. I'm your host K. Almer and in this video
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.360]   It's tinkering with quantum blocks part two
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.640]   So now if you guys remember the first one was tinkering with quantum blocks and also a
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.960]   Another video I did right after that again, you know doing more things you can do with your quantum block
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.320]   Call copying frequencies with Layla quantum blocks
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.840]   But just to do a recap basically in part one, you know, I kind of covered
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.620]   You know the different numbers that people use that are translations to frequencies and mantras, you know
[00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.320]   They I think was Lord Mears numbers the gregory grab a boy boy numbers
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.160]   Healing mantras and so forth and then also to and in this copying frequencies video
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.720]   I covered using or how to use molecular frequencies and resonant frequencies, you know sound
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.200]   frequencies and
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.560]   And how to use those and how to use your blocks to copy them with the idea that you know
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.120]   You basically would copy it to a piece of foil put it in a block and then of course there's things that will happen
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.840]   It's either you could either broadcast it's quantum broadcasting
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.240]   and that means putting something in your block and it broadcasts that frequency into the field of the block or
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.440]   You could take that foil and put it in a you know one of your quantum capsules
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.680]   And then you know it would do the same thing
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.640]   But at a much smaller level and you could wear it and walk around or you could put a picture in there with the frequency
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.000]   And then it would send the frequency to whatever's in that picture
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.540]   You know and that's kind of the whole idea behind quantum upgrade, which is sending frequencies
[00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.320]   Through quantum entanglement to you know a source, which is you know a photo of
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.760]   Anything, you know a friend loved one pet you name it
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.440]   So that's kind of what I covered in in the first two of the series here
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.600]   Now this is kind of like part two of the first one, which is tinkering with your quantum block
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.720]   So I just wanted to share more ideas on how you can kind of just you know leverage the investment you've made
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.360]   in quantum blocks because you know these things aren't cheap, but they are
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.920]   Incredibly versatile in terms of quantum healing
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.720]   And you could really use them for a lot more than just you know the the things that are you know advertised on the website
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.160]   So I just wanted to share my ideas because I'm the tinker
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.120]   And so you know just this is what that video is so I got four new ideas to share with you guys
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.080]   That I thought you might like now before I do that though
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.360]   I do want to let you know that I I took all of the ideas from these first two videos
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.920]   and I kind of just put them all into a
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.920]   You know into a list right so that you can you have like a one source list of where to find all these different frequencies and sources of
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.480]   Frequency so if you go to my blog the Tinkers Academy, that's just type Tinkers dot Academy in your URL
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.040]   Window and it goes right there or they'll be a link in the video description
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.120]   But if you go right here that to the quantum energy section of my blog
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.520]   I kind of just talk about you know lay the quantum tech. There's different group sections here
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.240]   So there's a full section for quantum tech. There's another one for upgrade another one for traumis
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.080]   But then if you get right in here down here in the the tinker supplies
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.720]   You know some of you know that I got I maintain a list of tinker supplies
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.800]   So that's just if you're making capsules and cards and you name it
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.280]   Then you know this is kind of like where I've got a list of all of those things that you can kind of go find
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.280]   But I did add the new section
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.360]   I'm referring to is this one called frequencies
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.480]   So now if you want to tinker around with frequencies, then here's the list
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.640]   So basically, it's all the different free frequencies that I use from YouTube to Spotify at a quantum lab
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.560]   You know biometry signatures. Here's the gregory grab a boy
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.200]   Healing mantras and so forth so you can just you know link away
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.760]   And of course, there's list of healing frequencies that that I really enjoy on on you know that I use on off of
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:02.160]   YouTube the tone generators and of course the frequencies you you would need to subscribe to you know services and things like that
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.500]   So here's the full list. So if you know it's part of the whole tinker supply concept here
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.840]   For those of you who want to you know tinker around with your quantum devices. There you go. Okay, so now
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.440]   first idea here for part two is
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.040]   imprinting water now in this video right here copying frequencies
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:29.020]   You know when I talked about how do you copy a sound you know a resonant frequency like a specific hertz or
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.880]   You know just sounds and how do you copy that and the whole and it's covered in this video how to do that
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.920]   And you basically transfer it to water and then use water that that copied water
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:45.960]   You use that water as the source of the frequency to copy onto foil now the idea though that I wanted to kind of impress upon you
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.000]   Is that just the imprinting part is really really cool
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.840]   And and I and you know like the entire business model for some of these websites that sell frequencies is just simply that
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.960]   It's just imprinting. So you can take anything you want to
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.200]   Bring into your body or pour into your garden, right?
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.080]   I mean you could put plant food into water and then water your plants
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.560]   You could put vitamins the frequency of that and put it into water
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.640]   And then you know drink it so you know you don't have to necessarily always use the you know the imprinted water as a source to copy
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.000]   Other things you can also just use it as you know as a fuel for you or your plants
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   So I do want to really kind of just really emphasize that it's a great tinker to kind of see like hey, you know
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.080]   What happens when you know I just start you know transferring the frequencies of my daily vitamins and it to water
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.480]   And of course if you guys, you know have been in the quantum space for a while
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.640]   You'll know of a guy named Masaru emoto
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.040]   And he proved that you you know that water is holds memory
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.280]   And that you could basically once you imprint that
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.280]   memory or
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.720]   Information onto water that it actually changes water and the water will hold that memory and you know water is what and look with crystal
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.760]   So it'll hold that information. It'll hold the frequency
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.000]   So you're ingesting it and you're infusing the rest of your body with those frequencies when you drink imprinted water
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.200]   So now if you go on some of these websites or anything like anything in your in your cabinet even medicines
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.040]   you can imprint them on the water and you could drink that and again, you know plant food for plants and
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.320]   And you know pet vitamins for your pet water, you know for the water you give your pets
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.640]   So really you know really tinker around with it, right? There's a huge benefit
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:39.160]   To you know the frequency aspect of your health and your pet's health and your plants and so forth and just using imprinted water
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.160]   You know, I really does make a difference. So give that a try
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160]   I think that's a really great idea
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.240]   To kind of pursue and then of course, I just wanted to you know disclaimer
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.080]   There's the idea of can I replace?
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:59.720]   The frequency of vitamins with taking the physical vitamin themselves. That's a whole nother conversation
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.520]   I'm not gonna get deeply into that right now. I've actually talked a lot about that in our telegram chat group
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.800]   But you know, there's definitely
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   People out there that are that are experimenting with that. It's definitely something to consider. There are
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.200]   Beings out there that live off frequency and energy, which you know, they're really rare
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.240]   But you know it but the concepts out there. Okay, just want to leave it at that now
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.920]   The next idea I wanted to kind of share with you is the idea of using sounds. So a couple of weeks ago
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.920]   I was just tinkering around I was working on
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.520]   making some new boosters and
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.000]   The concept of you know, like I've always kind of focused on frequencies like the frequencies for you know, you know
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.120]   Vitamins and the frequencies for you know all this other stuff that I do, you know testosterone and brain boosting and you know
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.880]   That stuff the allergy thing and and then it kind of occurred to me
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:52.120]   It's like well, I haven't ever you actually use sounds like the sounds of just nature
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.840]   And so I and and the thing that I wanted to do and I did post this to the telegram chat group
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:02.280]   And of course, you know, telegram is everything just scrolls up really fast and so I'm not sure, you know
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.040]   How many people actually saw it?
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.080]   You know and that I was doing this and I kind of wanted to share it again
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:13.760]   Because I know the majority of you have not seen it, which is the idea that you know, hey, you can use sound not just frequencies
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:20.240]   That are meant to alleviate pain or help with acne or you know, whatever, right?
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.560]   But you can also use sounds that then sounds
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.720]   Have a frequency obviously, right?
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.840]   So I made this frequency and I called it grounding because I was sitting there and I was thinking okay, you know
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:39.880]   How can I ground using frequencies and I thought well use the frequencies or the sounds of nature
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.680]   And put that into a frequency set so I kind of created a booster for myself
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.440]   I call it grounding
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.480]   Um, and it's got the sounds of different things in nature
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.400]   And so I kind of did this little five-minute video and I posted it on telegram
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.480]   Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and play for you guys that missed it to kind of give you an idea
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:03.160]   What I put into that, you know, what I copied and put into that little booster that I made for myself
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.320]   Just to kind of tinker. All right, here you go. Hey everybody real quick video to explain
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.800]   This new frequency. I just kind of came up with
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:15.000]   I'm in actually in the process of doing the pain management frequency for the contest
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.760]   So I started tinkering around and coming up with other frequencies as well that popped in my head
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.600]   So I'm working on like seven or eight right now
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:29.240]   The one I just finished is called grounding and so what I decided to do with this one was I was kind of thinking about
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.400]   You know, how would you capture a frequency for that, right?
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.760]   And because it's been coming up in our telegram chat group
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:42.040]   And so I was thinking about it and it really kind of occurred to me that it was the sounds of nature
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.040]   Um, and there's grounding as in, you know, put your feet on the grass
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.480]   But in my mind, there's also a grounding of our you know, like our our not our electrical field
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.680]   But our bio field and how we interact with nature
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.200]   So I did some research
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.320]   And I came up with just a few frequencies that I put in there
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.880]   And I've kind of been testing it for the last two days and I'm really really liking it
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:09.960]   So, you know, this is what that is and so it really just comes down to just a few frequencies
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.440]   in this set
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.600]   And one of them is the sound of bees
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.360]   So if you had if you do any research on bees, you know, one of the things about
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.360]   Beekeepers is that they they all tend to have really long lives
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.880]   And they discovered that there's a frequency of bees humming
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.400]   And it does different things and one of the things it does
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.400]   It's actually has this longevity
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:37.800]   Anti-aging effect on the beekeepers who are around the frequency of bees all the time
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:45.080]   It's also another little side tangent thing too that scientists have also discovered that the the actual frequency of bees from a
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:52.040]   Simatic standpoint, which is the phrase that is used when you you know, all frequencies will create a pattern, you know
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:59.240]   In water and it'll create a pattern like you put sand on a on a plate and play the frequency and it creates a symbol
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.360]   And they've discovered that the actual honeycomb the actual octagonal shape of honeycomb
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.720]   Is actually because of the frequency
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.440]   So one of the you know like again, so I thought that was real interesting
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:16.200]   And I felt that you know, hey, the sound of bees is has a remarkable effect on the humans that are around it
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.440]   And so, you know, that's a great frequency to use for this
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:26.360]   Also cat per the sound of a cat per has a very very relaxing
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:31.960]   Anti-agxiety effect on on people who are exposed to that frequency
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.760]   So I wanted to put that in and of course whale songs
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.640]   You know, there's something magical about whale songs and I put that in of course birds
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.280]   You know, an interesting thing about birds if you are
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.920]   Someone who grows a garden
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.160]   You know, there's this research that was done
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:54.600]   And the product that was created from it called sonic bloom where they discovered that there's a symbiotic relationship between
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.720]   The songs of birds that create this harmonic frequency
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:06.520]   And the symbiotic relationship between that frequency and plants and it's actually a measurable scientific
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.200]   Effect that the sound of birds have this growth
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.920]   And this really beneficial effect on plants and I'm thinking well, hey
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:20.520]   If it really helps plants, why not help us right and of course I threw in the shuman resonance
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:26.040]   Which is the frequency of our earth and then I threw in this frequency called environmental clearing
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.440]   And that is the molecular frequency of pure water
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.360]   And so just kind of just share with you just a few of these on on how I found them
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.720]   If you're looking for sounds or what I call acoustics
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.560]   If you go on youtube and you just use this acronym asmr
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.680]   And you type in anything you're going to get the sounds
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.720]   That you may be looking for that you want to add to your booster
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.160]   So just to kind of give you an example, you know, this is the one I found for
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.720]   Birds, it's the sound of birds chirping, you know for that that effect
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:02.120]   And then also to this, you know cat per you can find that out there in the world and you just add
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.640]   These frequencies, these are all frequencies sounds or frequencies, right now in the environmental clearing
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.360]   That's just something I got that I I've owned this for quite a long time back in the day when I was
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.720]   Really working a lot with the slim spurling
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:21.480]   And twisted sage tensor coils life life rings and I used to make them and I did this for years
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.880]   But they sell this frequency called environmental clearing where they actually
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:32.520]   Captured the molecular frequency of very pure water. So I bought it back in the day and I have it in my library
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.000]   I also have a library of
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.160]   different human
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.640]   Recordings and this is just the one I used it's not really pleasant to listen to
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.320]   But that is literally the sound of our planet
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.480]   And so combining that with whale songs that I found on spotify
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.560]   You know, and it also includes that, you know, the ocean waves
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.160]   I wanted to include that
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:01.560]   Because these frequencies, right these sounds when you're out there in nature and you're sitting on the beach and you hear the waves
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:07.880]   You know, it does something to us, right? It really calms us down and it it's helpful and so yeah
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.920]   So these are all the different sounds that I kind of put together
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.400]   Into others my dogs, and then that's just the sounds that I put into it
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.320]   So that's what comprises this new frequency. I really enjoying it
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:24.360]   This is one of the approaches that you can use to kind of create your own sets, but
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.240]   Someone asked me to explain it
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.200]   And there you go. That's what's in that frequency and
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:37.080]   I'm liking it and I encourage all you guys to go and and play around yourselves and and see what you can come up with
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.920]   All right, there you go
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:44.440]   So that was my new tank. I created a booster called grounding and it was the sounds of nature
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.440]   And actually and as I say in that little video, I actually really enjoy it
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.600]   So the next idea idea number three is patches
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:58.200]   You know if you've noticed that there's like well first of all there's been patches
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:04.680]   Forever, I mean in terms of like patches you could use for you know sore muscles and so forth
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:10.920]   But lately in the last few years there's been this outcrop of of just all these different patches for health
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:17.000]   And you've got companies like life wave and towel patch and and frequency cell and sefi dots
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:22.600]   and there's so many and they're just there's on and on and on there's all these different patches that are coming out now and
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:28.280]   What's interesting about these health patches is I specifically like with the life wave and the towel patch
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.080]   and the frequency cell
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.320]   Is that they're using a
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:40.280]   Like basically what the best I can describe it is they're using a patch that's got cellulose
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:47.240]   Cellulose materials with with finely grinded nano particles and nano crystals, right?
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.560]   And they're all tuned to a specific
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:56.600]   Frequency so that when your bodies own bio photons are emitted, you know because you are you actually do glow
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.760]   We just can't see it with you know within our our eyesights spectrum
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:05.960]   But you can see it with other you know equipment you can see our glow and some people call that your aura
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.000]   so we're out we're putting out bio photons all the time
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:15.560]   And and so when your bio photons hit that the the patch right then that then it refrex
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.680]   reflects off of the patch
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:25.480]   Back into your body and then the placement of the patches are specific to meridian points along along
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.200]   Your main meridian points of your body, you know according to traditional chinese medicine
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:36.840]   And that stimulates those meridians which stimulates the related organs of on those meridians, you know
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.320]   Kind of long story short and so and there's been some really great feedback
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:48.440]   You know, I mean these these two right here like towel patch just became fda proved x 39's got tons of studies
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.800]   Uh, you know that that that proved it it's all patented stuff
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:58.360]   So the idea of infusing frequencies to specific meridian points of your body
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:05.720]   Has been proven to be quite beneficial from a health and healing perspective, which is pretty fascinating
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.960]   So then you've got this other one, you know like sefi dots is a programmable one
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:15.160]   Where there's like an app and you take the dot and you you use it with your app and you can program
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:19.480]   The dot uh for whatever frequencies in the sefi library
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.080]   So, you know that so that concept is out there, you know, you could take
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:30.440]   You know a dot, you know at patch place it right here on a meridian point and then you could start tinkering around
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.920]   with all of the
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:40.040]   Infinite number of combinations of things you could do to you know for your health by simply using patches
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.720]   So I was thinking because all of these things are not cheap
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.600]   And and i'm pretty pake
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.040]   Uh when it comes to spending that's a whole way word for frugal
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.800]   And so what I thought would be a great tink
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:18:01.080]   Uh as a tinker is just to emulate the concept of these patches and to simply take a dime
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.760]   Okay, a us dime and some medical tape
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.800]   Copy a frequency onto the dime
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.120]   Pull out one of those chinese, you know meridian charts figure out
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.960]   Let's say you've got a stomach issue or your knee hurts or whatever
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:22.040]   Right and you figure out where to put it on your body to get to that organ or that that area of your body
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.720]   It could even be something as general as your vegas nerve, right?
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:30.600]   And then simply take the medical tape and the diamond and tape it to you
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.360]   Just like one of these patches and you would save hundreds of dollars
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.640]   But it's I think it's a interesting idea
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.720]   You know, I haven't tried it yet. I got to tell you I'm busy with all my other tinkering
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.120]   But it just popped in my head one day when we were having this talk about the patches and I was thinking
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:51.160]   Yeah, why not? It's the same thing because here's an example like the x 39 patch
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.360]   Uses a it generates the frequency of a peptide
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.240]   I think it's ghk cu it's a copper peptide and of course you're using that frequency of that peptide as
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.840]   Has it has some really great benefits and that's what this entire life waves is giant company with
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.880]   Tons of customers and you know, there's testimonies and all that stuff and trials and stuff
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:19.640]   And so these guys are saying yeah when you stimulate those meridian points with copper peptide chk
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:25.240]   cu uh frequency then x y z happens and and they're all happy right and they're buying it
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.400]   But they're hundreds of dollars and and so i'm thinking well why not take that same frequency
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.880]   Put it on a you know copy it to a dime
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:37.400]   Stick it to your body and you almost would have the same thing, you know almost right?
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:43.560]   It's not the same, but it's a tinker. I would just I would love to hear what you guys do if you give this a try
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:51.000]   But I think it's a pretty good idea. You know, hey, i'm a tinker. What can I say? Anyway, that's idea number three idea number four is
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.640]   making a copy of your loved ones
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:01.240]   Uh, this is my prior dog and her name was keelala and she was the absolute love of my life
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.720]   I'm a single father. I raised a daughter from when she was two years old
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.560]   And now she's you know as I always brag about it. She's in grad school now
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.800]   And so I you know we got her well actually got her for my daughter
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:19.960]   Christmas Eve when she was 10 years old and so I raised keelala along with my daughter
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:26.040]   They were like sisters and so it was just the three of us for all those years and keelala lived for
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.680]   Nine and a half years before she passed from cancer a few years ago
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:37.320]   And the thing was was uh, you know, that was probably the worst moment of my life letting her go
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.400]   Um, and it really broke me and I've never recovered
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:47.400]   So the veterinarian clinic was so kind and they made a paw print of keelala
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:51.720]   In plaster and they gave that to me when I got when I picked up her ashes
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:56.920]   And I took her ashes and I put it in and I did like I got one of these uh, you know
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.840]   Pendants they're called urn pendants and I got an urn pendant
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.520]   And I made one for my daughter with keelala's ashes
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.880]   And I also had another just solid pendant for myself
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:14.280]   That I made with keelala's ashes and I put it on my keychains and and to this day I carry her ashes
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.880]   with me everywhere I go, you know, she's part of my keychain and she's part of my heart and she'll always be
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:27.320]   deeply deeply a part of who I am and so and I miss her every day, but the idea here was that unfortunately
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.960]   keelala passed the year before um, you know, phillip ever started layla q
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.960]   And I never got to get I never had an opportunity to capture
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:41.560]   A copy of her and what I mean by a copy of her is when you think about
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.440]   living beings any kind of living being, you know, we have dna
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:51.880]   And in in in my opinion, you know, our dna is like our antenna to source
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:58.600]   It's also the signature of our unique signature in the universe of who we are specifically
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.360]   That you know that specific being and it holds the essence
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.760]   Of your energy and it is in a copy of your frequency
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.240]   The you know, the resonating frequency of your dna is a copy of you
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.960]   And it's a copy of I would say your essence
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.040]   And I I so wish that I would have got a copy of keelala's
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:23.640]   And so that I could add it to her pendant that I carry with me on my keychain
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.520]   So
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:31.160]   I want to just say as tink number four on how you could kind of get some use, you know, you know, leverage your
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.040]   your investment in a quantum block
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.560]   And would be to make a copy so, you know, of course I keep this is keelala's dog
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:45.240]   I got keelala a dog and his name is norman and gosh. She's like nine years old now
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.200]   But I made a copy of norman
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.200]   And so it's just a matter of you know, uh, I just made a copy of him
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:57.320]   And I got it now. I have I have him on on I have a copy of norman's soul
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.640]   You know, that's how I feel and it's so special to me and and I can't tell you
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.800]   how much of a comfort it is to have
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:13.400]   keelala's ashes in a little pendant on my keychain and every day I know that she's with me still
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:18.440]   And the idea of being able to do that with norman, but not just
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.440]   Unfortunately, you know, I I will outlive him but there'll be a day
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.760]   Where I will have a second pendant on my keychain and it'll be norman
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.080]   but
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.080]   I will have also have
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:36.200]   the quantum signature of him with his ashes and and I know that
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:43.240]   It'll bring comfort to me and it will mean a lot to me. And so I think that if that resonates with you
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:49.800]   Uh, you know, I I just want to say I thought this was a good idea and I wanted to share it with you
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:55.720]   Uh, and of course if your dog is too big to fit, you know, like luckily norman fits in the grand block
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:02.200]   You know, you could use a tough of fur or if you're going to copy an animal with hair like
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.760]   my daughter
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:10.360]   We used to have a horse and I at the time, you know before the horse passed because he was getting pretty old
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:16.280]   You know, I cut some of his hair off his tail and I made her a pendant with the hair inside the tail
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:23.320]   And so I could always just go get his hair and make a quantum copy of him and add that to her pendant
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:29.480]   If she ever wants to but the idea though is, you know, hair fur the dog itself the cat
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:34.760]   Also your own loved ones like, you know, I I've been trying to remember the next time I see my daughter
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.840]   I want to grab a copy of her
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.560]   and to have those frequencies of the people and
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.120]   Animals that you love and to know that you'll always have them with you
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.000]   Uh in that regard I think is so
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.720]   deeply meaningful
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:53.320]   Um that I think it's one of the best tinks you could do with your block
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:58.840]   And that that's my opinion. I just wanted to share that with you because it touches me deeply
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:04.040]   So anyway, those are the four ideas that I have for you in this tutorial
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.520]   Um, I hope you thought they were interesting. I hope I encourage you to give them a try
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.280]   Again, you can go on my blog and there'll be a link in the description below
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.200]   Uh for that list of frequencies. So hey, you know tinker away
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.880]   You know go and try all these different ideas and see what works for you
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.360]   Uh because you know, it's
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.760]   This is what they're for
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:28.280]   Uh, you know, I never look at my blocks as something. I just put in the corner of the room
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.280]   I mean I've got all of them doing something
