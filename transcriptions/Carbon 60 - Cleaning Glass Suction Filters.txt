[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me Kay Elmer and this
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.280]   video is a little different I'm just going to answer a question that I've been
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.440]   getting quite often in the last month or two about how to clean glass suction
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.720]   filters and so I thought I'd just go ahead and do a real quick little video so
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.560]   you guys can see what I do. So here we go. Now when I mentioned glass suction
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.120]   filters I'm talking about these little glass rigs where there's a funnel on
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.620]   top glass thing you know glass flask and then right here is you either have a
[00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.360]   metal clamp or a plastic clamp that clamps down so that the two attach and
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.860]   then there's a you put filter paper right here in the middle so and then of
[00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.220]   course there's this other one I've talked about before and these are the
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.000]   disposable plastic ones and these things are great too. So let me just real just
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.720]   quick so we're on the same page. These glass ones there's a lot of pros and
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.160]   cons for both but the glass ones are obviously the most economical. The pros
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.720]   are that you can use different size filters in terms of thickness of
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.320]   filtration you can use because it's glass you know you use it as long as you
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.240]   want you know there's a point where this top funnel has a stone and that's
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.760]   there's one that has a stone and one that doesn't this one doesn't have it in
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.320]   the picture but the one I use has a stone and that stone will someday I
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.600]   expect someday get fully fully clogged but I'll show you how I keep it clean
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.480]   and then of course the cost is a one-time cost of $35 and the filters now you just
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.200]   buy these little packs of paper filters different sizes of filters that fit the
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.000]   funnel the funnel diameter and then there's also different filtration sizes
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.120]   as well so you got to be really careful when you buy this thing and you're buying
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.680]   your filters you're matching that you make sure that you get a filter that's
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.840]   gonna fit this funnel as well as making sure that the filtration sizes the one
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.600]   you're aiming to get now the cons about using this thing is that the funnel is
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.440]   always smaller than the flask okay so the one I have has a 350 milliliter funnel
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.840]   but a thousand milliliter flask and so 350 right I got to fill this thing up
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.760]   three times to fill up the flask and when you know when I'm you know running a
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.400]   batch of C60 that's one full liter you know a thousand milliliters I you know
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.600]   I got to basically babysit this thing watch it go all the way down fill it back
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.520]   up way goes down fill it back up you know fill it three times she out the
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.280]   babysit the thing and that's a little bit of a of a pain in the Akole and then
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.840]   the other thing too that's I just mentioned is that the stone in the funnel
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.200]   if you have the kind that has a stone I don't I mean I do but some people don't
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.360]   the stone may or will I don't know just yet it hasn't happened to me it may get
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.040]   filled up I mean clogged up eventually we won't be able to clean it I haven't
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.040]   run across that yet but I kind of you'll see in the pictures that you know why I
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.080]   believe that's that could happen now that's the that's the the glass when I'm
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.800]   gonna walk through how to clean this thing because it ain't it's not it's not
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.360]   intuitive man this thing is like you know totally different little thing you've
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.920]   ever had in your kitchen before now just want to mention too on this on the
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.360]   plastic one you know I get questions about which one do you use and why and
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.600]   what for so the reason that I use both and I kind of had a video in the past
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.280]   where I kind of just said I stick to this one because of economy well then over
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.120]   here I kind of went back to the plastic ones because I'm just lazy and and
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.760]   because here's the thing about the plastic ones that the funnel holds the
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.240]   full amount okay so you know when you're kind of busy or you're gonna like
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.800]   leave for the day you know a lot of times on weekends I'm not home all day and so
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.760]   or even at night after work you know I saw it's really nice to just fill this
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.800]   thing up plug it into the pump set it and forget it done and then you know the
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.240]   next day it's just done and then I like that you don't have to babysit it and
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.840]   there's disposable there's no cleaning because you know you're gonna see this
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.680]   is it takes work and then you know it's 11 bucks okay and so you know but here's
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.640]   the cons right you it's only gonna be the filter size of the one you buy so as
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.360]   you buy these things each one of these things will have a different filter
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.480]   size and then you have to pick the one that you want you have to size of the
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.040]   filter I you know the meaning the like 0.22 micron meters and then of course the
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.640]   size of the funnel in the flask which thousand milliliters and you know the
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.920]   cost it's 10 times more expensive than filtering using paper filters with the
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.360]   glass and this is what I mean by that is like you buy filters and then I think I
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.080]   came out with a video my last video was like I came out like 37 cents a filter
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.240]   you know and so basically if you have to run it through three times that's like
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.720]   what a buck it's a dollar to run something through this one whole time
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.000]   you know like a thousand milliliters over here you want to run a thousand
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.240]   milliliters are gonna cost you $11 so it's 10 times more expensive than to go
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.680]   use this one and so but you know if 11 bucks is nothing to you and and you're
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.640]   lazy and for me it's like hey I like I like I like setting it and I like
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.200]   forgetting it so I do use these when I'm making full-on liters but then I do
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.640]   use this as well especially when I'm using when I'm doing this is kind of
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.920]   how it's worked out I use this one when I'm using pulverized C60 and I use this
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.920]   one and when I'm using powder to C60 and that's kind of how I've settled into
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.800]   it so here you go cleaning process now off when you're cleaning this class
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.160]   suction filter I leave the pump connected you're gonna need that you're
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.520]   gonna want to wash it by running dish soap and boiling water through it
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.400]   until you fill the flask and then once you've washed it you want to rinse it by
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.080]   running boiling water through it again and fill the flask okay so another
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.080]   thousand milliliters and that's just how this is my way of doing it by the way I
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.480]   didn't look this up or anything I've just had to wash this thing dozens of
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.440]   times and so I have figured out that this is like for me it's the absolute
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.000]   best way to get this puppy clean step four is leave the pump running for an
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.920]   hour when you're done because what you want that pump to do is keep that vacuum
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.320]   pressure and just suck every last little bit of moisture out of that stone that's
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.320]   mine if you don't have a stone you can skip step four but I leave the pump
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.880]   running on the stone because I want it to just suck all the moisture out and
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.440]   then and after that you wash the flask and the funnel stem where there's a
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.840]   stem in here and I highly recommend using lab brushes and I didn't want it
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.120]   first I was really a pake about it which is means that that's a Hawaiian we're
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.200]   sorry for for being cheap and so I don't want to spend the money in on these
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.040]   lab brushes I'll just use whatever I got and I couldn't find anything that I
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.680]   have that would get into these little crevices around you know this this this
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.680]   weird angle through this little tiny nozzle and then there's that stem and
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.120]   nothing so I just ended up buying the brushes oh by the way everything I'm
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.720]   talking about as you know is gonna be in the video description links provided
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.720]   so so now I made this little video and let's just walk you through it so here
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.080]   we go okay so this is my rig and what I did was I ran essentially I had run an
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:03.080]   entire 1000 milliliters of pulverized C60 in olive and avocado oil through this
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:10.040]   thing using a 10 micron filter and you can just see this stone is supposed to
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:17.200]   be semi-white and it just up totally you know pulver I see 60 is a really unique
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:23.440]   form of C60 to deal with but it's so fine that it's gonna go through a lot
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.280]   of the filters and it gets stuck in your stone so I'm seriously thinking about
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.640]   getting the different kind of glass one that you saw in the picture as opposed
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.880]   to this kind of glass suction filter but anyway so that's what the stone looks
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.680]   like at the bottom of my funnel and you can see just how dark brown it got from
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.200]   the pulverized C60 so it it's kind of like I'm really rethinking it so I just
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.360]   use regular just soap and I've actually been thinking that maybe it might even
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.840]   be better to use like blue dawn because that's what they using on on when they
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.720]   have oil spills and stuff so I was thinking about trying that next but
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.120]   anyway just regular just soap boiling water and so the and then so you fill
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.040]   it up three times with boiling water and then you run the machine and you're
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.440]   gonna see what happens when I turn the machine on it's gonna just create the
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.480]   vacuum in the bottom part and pull all of that soap and and boiling water
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.000]   through that stone now you notice right now I'm just gonna stop it right here
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.160]   that before this thing creates this suction there is nothing dripping through
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.960]   at all you can just see it it's completely bone dry and so this stone is
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:36.040]   so saturated with P60 or PC 60 that the pulverized C60 that you know it's
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.360]   clogged and so now basically I'm gonna create the vacuum using the machine and
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.000]   then it starts to suck it through and you can see how dirty it is and and so
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.040]   basically it's gonna just draw that soap and the soap is important because soap
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.480]   is breaks down the oil right and so the soap and then the boiling water you know
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.400]   it's just gonna work together and it's gonna just suck it through you do this
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.800]   three times to get all of the you know soapy water three times you fill up the
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.120]   flasks this is what it looks like when you're done and you can see how you know
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:12.560]   the water gets pretty dirty and that's all C60 and the sludge from the oil and
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.640]   then your basic this is what it looks like you know you basically wash the stone
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.400]   that's the first wash the one and only wash actually and then the next thing you
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.880]   do is you just want to rinse it through pour the flask out obviously and then
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.720]   rinse it through I use you plain old boiling water and just good thing I have
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.880]   this little hot pot I love that thing and then I just fill it up three more
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.960]   times and then run water through but look how fast the water starts coming
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.600]   through the second time once you run the soap and and hot water through the
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.240]   boiling water it pretty much just look how fast the water just boiled poured
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.840]   through without me even turning on the vacuum but once that vacuum gets turned
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.400]   on it just goes straight it goes really quickly look how fast that thing's
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.480]   coming through once you run the soap and the boiling water through one time so
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.640]   after you run the the clear water which is the rinse quote to rinse cycle then
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:12.000]   you basically or this is what I do is I will then leave the vacuum pump running
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.600]   okay this is just as I'm I'll leave it running okay me stop right now after you
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:22.720]   are done rinsing okay this is what I do I leave the pump on for an hour and that
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.160]   again it this is I think a very important step it just keeps sucking it just
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.120]   keep sucking on that stone and it'll dry the stone it'll pull everything out
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.040]   to get all the moisture out or I would say the majority of the moisture out and
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.360]   so this is after I have washed it's after I have rinsed and this is what it
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:48.600]   looks like after I have let it suck dry for an hour and you can see look at
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.600]   that that went from super super super dark brown right and now it's kind of
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:58.280]   light tan and that's kind of the color of it so that's kind of how I do that and
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.520]   it's you know it's as simple as it looks just take a little bit of time and
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.000]   effort and then when the step five is when you're done leaving the you know
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.640]   drying your stone now if you don't have a stone like this one doesn't have a
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.640]   stone you know that's that's why I'm thinking maybe spend the 35 bucks and
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.480]   by the other model and then so but step five obviously either way you got to
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.480]   wash the flask in the funnel stem and so then that's why I highly recommend and
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:27.080]   the links are in the description to get these two brushes and you know they're
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.960]   not cheap like this one's like 14 bucks and this guy's like eight bucks but you
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.440]   know honestly it's like if you don't have the right tool for the job it's gonna
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.620]   be really hard to do the job so these are the two different brushes and so
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:43.040]   just to kind of point out because this guy's got this real steep angle you can
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.280]   get that whole circle and you can get a real good scrubby on the bottom and your
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.680]   flask come out just squeaky clean and then with this little straw guy this
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.940]   it's basically it is that's what it's for it's for cleaning the insides of
[00:11:54.940 --> 00:12:00.600]   straws and you just run that puppy up the stem wash it out real good and then I
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:06.240]   you can run it around the stem on the outer section of the stem inside the
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.620]   funnel and to clean that area up real nice rinse it out with hot water and
