[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960]   Hello everyone, I'd just like to say a good morning, and I'd like to welcome Philip von
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.160]   Holtzendorf of Leila Labs, which is a C60 company.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.280]   He's also one of the founders of Path of Love, another wonderful business opportunity that
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.480]   he's been pursuing for quite some time and helping people with all sorts of different,
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.720]   I guess, expanding their consciousness.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.400]   But what I want to kind of just talk with Philip about today, and I wanted to share this with
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.080]   everybody, is Philip's latest focus and his new venture, and I just wanted to kind of just
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.320]   talk to Philip about it and share that with everybody and kind of expand on what's on
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.320]   the new website.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.120]   So, Philip, hey, welcome.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.120]   Good morning.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.120]   How are you doing today?
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.120]   Hi.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.120]   I'm doing great.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.120]   Thanks for having me.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.400]   And so, you launched your new venture/website this week, and there's been quite a buzz in
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.400]   Telegram about it.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.040]   I mean, a lot of people are just really, I mean, this site is just beautiful.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.080]   And, of course, obviously, there's going to be, I've got questions, everyone's got some
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.960]   questions, you've been peppered with questions, literally, for every single hour, since you
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.480]   started, and everyone's proofreading your website is pretty funny.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.240]   But I guess the thing is, you've been doing all of this stuff with this, these 60 and
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.560]   the path of love.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.800]   I know that you've been in quantum energy, kind of that whole space for quite a long
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.880]   time, especially working with your wife, crew, and your partner, Roman.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.560]   But, you know, I was wondering, could you share with us, what is the new focus of this
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.960]   new company or this new product, the Leila Quantum Tech?
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.640]   I mean, could you kind of just expand, like, what's the focus of this one now, of this
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.640]   adventure?
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.640]   Absolutely.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.080]   Yeah, maybe one step back.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:02:00.280]   So what really drives me, where my passion is, is to help providing bridges between science
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.960]   and consciousness, if you will, that may sound pretty abstract, but 60, for example, is one
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.960]   of those things.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.800]   It can really, from our perspective, at least, bring humanity forward in a way that other
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.560]   substances and molecules haven't so far.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.680]   And it actually also works on the quantum level, quite significantly.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.720]   The 60 molecule, a lot of people don't know that.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.160]   And you know, where I'm coming from, I used to be in a big corporate career and all of
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.200]   that a long time ago, and very early on, notice that that's really not what life is about,
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   right?
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   I mean, that's a nice game.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.640]   It's not here on Earth, but it's really not why we came here for and what I came here
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   for.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.680]   So I always, for a long, long time, worked on actually trying to remember why I'm here
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.240]   and working on removing blockages that prevent me from seeing energies and things like that.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.920]   So fast forward, you know, that was fairly successful.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.280]   And now I feel like, because I was not born like my wife, crew, or Roman, where you can
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.720]   see all the energies and frequencies, I pretty much had forgotten all of that.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.000]   And now, you know, early on, I actually didn't think this even exists and thought, you know,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.160]   that's kind of crazy, but it really isn't.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.360]   And I kind of know how it is if you've forgotten these things, and if you're starting to understand
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.160]   that with your heart, there is more, right, there is more.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.040]   And now what we're doing with path of love and with C60, but also with this quantum approach
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.440]   is really helping people bridge the gap.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:54.160]   And this new focus with Lila Quantum Tech is on one hand on very special frequencies
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.040]   that can help with a lot of different situations and topics in life.
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.120]   And some of them are very, you know, use case focused, right?
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:12.960]   I mean, where, you know, like a sleep and rest card, for example, has a very specific purpose.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.360]   And then there are some other cards, though, that we also will be introducing more cards
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:26.080]   over the next several weeks and months that are focused more on the spiritual path, if
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.760]   you will, inner peace or unity.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.240]   Those would be frequencies that probably don't interest a lot of people that really have
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.160]   a very specific use case, hey, I want to sleep better or, you know, hey, I just want to heal
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.160]   my body with a heal frequency.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:47.760]   So there's a big bandwidth of how to, you know, move forward on your very individual
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.760]   path.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.040]   So some frequencies that we offer may really not be the right ones for some people.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.520]   And then others are exactly the right ones.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:05.800]   So it's a bandwidth, and we want it to not just cater to one group of people and really
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.480]   try to provide the best frequencies and healing frequencies we can.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.480]   And now, you know, you can see on the website, we may go into that, that we work with a network
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.960]   of healers together, and those are not just some healers, you know, that just say, hey,
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.000]   you know, I can heal, or, you know, I can do great things, yeah, we can all do great things,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.560]   frankly, and I actually support that.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.520]   There's a big difference between, you know, just getting started on something like that
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.560]   or being an absolute expert and professional, having done this for years and having trained
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.440]   thousands or hundreds of other healers.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.800]   And those people, we connect it with better, I mean, they have been our network already,
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.280]   so we connected them specifically for this purpose, and they all were more than willing
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:01.960]   to, you know, help and to think about, okay, what are these frequencies that right now
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.440]   would be very helpful for people, and we're living in very special times, right, and everybody
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.880]   would agree probably with that, and we understand that all on a little bit different level.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:23.160]   So that is the one focus, really, and before I forget that, I must say that love is what
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.280]   really vibrates in everything that we do.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:34.680]   It's kind of the overarching umbrella, and so this is not an industrial focus here.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.480]   This is really a focus, you know, to help people, but also the environment, animals,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.120]   and plants for that matter, and have love be part of everything that we do, but also
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.940]   every product that we deliver.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:07:00.560]   And yeah, expanding beyond that, certainly the quantum energy is just a great way of,
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:08.240]   you know, working with frequencies and enhancing certain products, right, so quantum energy
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:15.320]   can be defined in various ways, it can be named in various ways, I want to make sure
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:22.480]   people understand that this is not just about technology here, yeah, it is about technology
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:30.560]   on one hand, but really what we keep forgetting is that we have this ability that we can all
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:40.920]   access if we just work on it, really, for maybe some time, to actually also create these quantum
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:46.160]   energy field, concentrate quantum energy field, so our consciousness is able to do a lot of
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.200]   things that most of the people have forgotten that we can do that, right?
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:58.360]   So I think that's an important fact, yes, it's easier than to leverage technology, but
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.760]   it's really consciousness meets science, right?
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:10.840]   That is what this is about, because quantum physics enlighten people and inventors like
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:16.320]   Tesla or Bosco Rich or others, they've all been talking about the same thing, right,
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:22.320]   and they've been describing the same thing, so none of this is here just scientific or
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:31.880]   spiritual, no, it's a merge, and yeah, we try to provide products that people can use that
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:39.280]   help them in their daily lives in multiple situations, whether at home, at work, if kids
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:49.280]   go to school, but also bringing a little bit of a new focus on animals and plants as well,
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:56.000]   because one thing we know is that obviously we're all frequency and quantum energy works
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.320]   and frequency works, and we can get a little bit later into that, but a lot of people,
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.200]   because we're so blocked and we're just in a way, often, we're programmed, or we just
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:14.280]   think, guys, this is not real, it doesn't exist, it still works then, but sometimes we
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:19.360]   have a hard time feeling it, and it's kind of like a process to feel a bit more of what
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:28.080]   these things do, but animals, for example, they don't have these concepts of this works
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:34.480]   or it doesn't work, it just is there, and they leverage it, and they enjoy it, and you
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.760]   can help animals, because if we talk about EMF, for example, certainly they're impacted
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:46.160]   as well, and what can they do about it, so we tend to think about, okay, well, can we
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:52.920]   do for ourselves, and there are lots of great ideas that people have, what you can do to
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:10:00.200]   protect against EMF, but what you can do with your dog or with your cat, and they live with
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:07.280]   us here on Earth, so why not think about ways, how we can help them as well, and what you
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.460]   just see here on the website in regards to animals is really just beginning.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:18.640]   Right, so I get, you know, for the novice individual, how would you describe, I mean,
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:25.120]   the idea of, you've taken, and you've taken, like, everyday objects, right, and even more
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:30.640]   interesting is, let's talk about the EMF shielding clothing, which I think is by itself, it's
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:36.160]   beneficial, but then you've added this enhancement to it that makes it even more valuable in
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:43.120]   terms of protecting our physiology from the harmful effects of electro-smog, and I want
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.840]   to talk about that because you've done some testing on that, and there's some really
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.840]   interesting results from that, but in terms of, like, if for people who don't understand
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:59.320]   that, you know, everyday objects can be enhanced with an energy force, and it's very difficult
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.600]   because it's not electricity, it's not magnetism, it's not typical physics that you learn in
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.080]   academia, but it's something beyond that.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.000]   So how would you describe that to someone who's never really, you know, ventured into
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.520]   the idea that there's an energy force that, you know, I guess the best way is, like, Einstein
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:25.920]   called this energy "ether", right, Wilhelm Reich, you know, created the term "orgon",
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:32.200]   of course, the Asians for, you know, forever have called it "chi" or "ki", and of course,
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:38.480]   the Indians' "arvetics" have called it "prana", but, you know, I mean, or even are those concepts
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:44.160]   of energy applicable to the idea of quantum, and how would you explain it, because, you
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.960]   know, because really, from a novice standpoint, you know, I look at your website or a novice
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:54.200]   would look at your website and go, "Oh, coasters, bracelets, and mugs, you know, whoopee,"
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.200]   right?
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.640]   I mean, honestly, but, you know, but truly, though, these are not just, but these have
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:06.620]   been confused with this energy so that all of the benefits that you're describing, you
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:11.640]   know, come through this enhancement, and so how would you describe that energy?
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:17.800]   Yeah, I think that's one of the hardest tasks, probably, to describe this energy.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:23.240]   I think you've done a great job already of describing it the way you've done it, because
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:30.620]   often, you know, the general ways to describe something in the material world doesn't really
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:35.920]   apply for something very energetic, where, you know, you can't really, with your brain,
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.520]   it's hard to understand.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:44.140]   So anyway, I think everybody would agree that there's consciousness, right?
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:51.600]   So otherwise, you wouldn't be able to notice things and just being a body, and then there's
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.040]   a certain energy, right?
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:13:00.760]   There's a certain energy that makes a plant grow, for example, and that drives you, that's
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.720]   just a life force that everybody can sense within themselves, right?
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.760]   It's, you know, I mean, I remember very early on when I started thinking about these things,
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.880]   and I hadn't met crew and all that, you know, it's like you have this concept, you're your
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:26.160]   body, and that's kind of it, and no, we basically just live in our body, and it may take some
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:32.240]   time for people to realize that and internalize that, but anyway, it's really this energy.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:39.480]   And then it's just not, the energy's all over the place, yeah, quantum energy is everywhere,
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.480]   right?
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:46.600]   You know, it's, it really is everywhere, then the question is, you know, can you move it?
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.540]   Can you concentrate it?
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.960]   And then can you put it in objects, for example, and the answer is yes, you can, and you can
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.480]   even do that with consciousness.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.880]   So, you know, if we had Roman here right now, he could just demonstrate that, you could
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:08.720]   just put a cup somewhere on your table, and then over the distance, he could put quantum
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.080]   energy in it, right?
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.760]   It's absolutely possible, and a lot of people may not believe that, but it's still possible.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.240]   So now, do you want to ask something?
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:24.200]   No, I just, I, yeah, I just want to say that if people want to actually see the concept
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:33.260]   of an individual manipulating three-dimensional physics, there's a YouTube video out there
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:41.020]   of a, of a Chi master, and he, he, and this is a, this is a real video of, of this guy,
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.900]   and they're having lunch, and one of them says, "Well, could you show us?"
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:50.020]   And so this master takes a chopstick, and he concentrates on it, and he just pushes it
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:55.260]   through the top of the table, and then picks it up on underneath it.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:15:01.140]   And it's like, okay, how did, you know, and so it's, it's, it's, it's examples of that.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:07.020]   It's like, how do, you know, shouting monks take, you know, your hand, which has gotten
[00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:12.540]   like whatever 28 bones in it, and push it through, you know, a log, and then none of
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.540]   the bones break?
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:19.380]   I mean, it's those kinds of amazing feats of, of individuals stretching their consciousness
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.100]   beyond the three-dimensional physics that we understand it to be that, that's, that's
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.740]   what, how I got into this, which was like, okay, how do you explain that?
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.100]   And then all the other, you know, the academics, they cannot explain that.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:37.100]   In fact, one of the most important aspects of actual academic science is the concept
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.140]   of the placebo effect.
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:45.460]   You know, academic science accepts the placebo effect, right, as part of every single study
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.460]   they have.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.700]   But what is that?
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.620]   So you're, so, you know, I always like to challenge academics by saying, well, you know,
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.100]   you believe in the, you know, you accept the placebo effect.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.740]   In fact, you would alter all of your studies to take it into account.
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:58.740]   Yes, we do.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:59.740]   All right.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:00.740]   Then what is it?
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.500]   People are just the convinced that they could do it.
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.940]   Oh, so you admit that somebody's mind can literally cure themselves by giving them like
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:13.700]   a sugar tablet and they're like, oh, no, no, that's not possible, but you just said there's
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:19.060]   a placebo effect and all of these people took a sugar pill and they were cured.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.540]   And but, but you don't, but you don't want to say that the power of the mind or the consciousness
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.520]   has the ability to cure, right?
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:29.020]   It's just so funny, but it's, it's, to me, it's, it's the greatest example of, hey, this
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.020]   really does exist.
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.980]   You guys accept that you just don't want to realize it.
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.100]   You don't want to admit it, right?
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.460]   But no, that's really cool.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:41.180]   So, okay, so you're, you're using consciously this, this energy, this is, and you're embedding
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.420]   that consciousness and that energy into these objects.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.380]   And so let's talk about, let's talk about your, your, I mean, I love the new focus on
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.380]   EMF clothing.
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:57.980]   I think, you know, is such a pronounced concern of the 5G electro smog and all of that stuff.
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.180]   So can we talk about that right now?
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.820]   Because you've got this page on your website that's got all these certificates, but, you
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.700]   know, they're in a foreign language to all of us, English only folks.
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.900]   So I was wondering if maybe you could kind of talk about, okay, you took, so you took
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:20.580]   clothing material, right, that has got 99% silver in the fabric, right?
[00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.740]   So they've taken silver and embedded it into the fabric.
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:28.620]   So it's what I would consider what we call like EMF shielded clothing.
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:34.140]   You could get at shielding companies that sell clothing materials, drapes, all that stuff,
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.140]   right?
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.620]   But you've taken this and you've, and you've kicked it up a notch by embedding energy
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.620]   into it.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.620]   And then you had it tested.
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:44.460]   So my first question is, when you have, can you, did you have it tested with and without
[00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.180]   the energy or just with the energy?
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.740]   No, no, absolutely.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:53.700]   You know, that otherwise wouldn't be, I mean, what would still be a good test?
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:59.180]   But it wouldn't be a perfect test, if you will, because we certainly, all those institutes
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.580]   that we work with, they're leading in their field.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:09.100]   So just that, the eGIF Institute, for example, they've been around for decades actually doing
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:15.060]   research on electro-smog or how you call it in the US EMF.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:22.700]   And, you know, from various aspects, they've done hundreds and thousands of studies and
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.700]   all of that.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:30.620]   And certainly they, they always look into, okay, so what is the impact first without,
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:36.100]   you know, using a divisor or in this case, a t-shirt, for example, or a hoodie, and then
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:41.380]   how is it, you know, without it, with it.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.380]   And so they were very focused just on EMF.
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:52.020]   And but there are tools that they have in devices that they can very simply measure that.
[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:58.700]   So and they really, so on those clothings, they, it's very easy for them actually to
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:04.700]   measure because you could, you could basically see with the device that it doesn't get through,
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.700]   right?
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.740]   Whether it's, it's a 3G, 4G, 5G, 5G, 5G, 5G, whatever they've tested, it just doesn't
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.980]   get through.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:19.700]   The more difficult part to test is then, okay, what is the impact on the human body when
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:27.120]   you wear a t-shirt, for example, that has all these benefits and is charged with quantum
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.120]   energy.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:38.660]   And so the Basa Institute in Austria, they, they had, I guess we work with about 14 different
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.760]   test objects.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.860]   So people basically, they call them test objects.
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:49.140]   I can't find that always funny, because they're really not objects, they're, they're living
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.140]   people.
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:56.500]   And yeah, and so then, you know, and they've tested EMF on one hand, actually in multiple
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.500]   ways.
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:03.300]   So EMF, just in general, then the total EMF blast in the car, like in an electric car
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.540]   where there's, there's a whole lot of EMF.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.380]   And then they've tested a lot of other things, I don't know if we want to go into that right
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:16.420]   now, but focusing on the EMF for now to basically, you know, test the person and their organ
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:25.420]   functions and meridian flow and everything, when they get exposed to the EMF or the EMF
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:32.740]   in the car, for example, and you see how it, how it develops, you know, what, and within
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:39.940]   very short timeframe, very, very short timeframe, all of their measurements ended up being pretty
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:40.940]   bad.
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.140]   It's, must say it's, it's different from person to person, right?
[00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.060]   Not everybody has exactly the same effects.
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:54.780]   Everybody's very unique and, but it in all cases, all the people that they've tested it,
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.900]   you know, EMF had a significant impact and they did pretty bad, right?
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:03.580]   You know, everybody would have been said, okay, well, you're not, you're not doing great.
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.940]   Your organs don't work well, your blood is not, not ideal and all of that.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:16.060]   You know, then they would give these people the t-shirt, the people didn't know what,
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:22.300]   what this does, had no clue and didn't also know what was really being tested.
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:33.020]   Then they were tested again and in all cases and 100% of the cases in extremely short timeframe,
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.660]   all of the functions were in ideal condition again.
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:45.340]   And I really mean that in ideal condition, which is very, very profound actually.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:51.220]   And it demonstrates very clearly that on one hand, you're shielding, but it did a lot
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.220]   of other things.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:22:02.540]   So, and it also proves, you know, the existence of the quantum energy in there because it improved
[00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:08.660]   really not just EMF and it went way beyond just the blocking effect because at the same
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:16.100]   time, this positive energy is being transmitted to your body.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:25.140]   And certainly, you know, then the body absorbs it and it has the positive effects that it
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.140]   can benefit from.
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:30.260]   And it was demonstrated with a lot of other things, you know, herbicides, pesticides, you
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:35.220]   know, what if you're exposed to that and certainly just the shielding material wouldn't do anything
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.060]   for that.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:44.140]   So it's actually pretty cool and we knew certainly that it's the great product and we could see
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:49.540]   energetically and feel from own testing what it does, but certainly it's a completely different
[00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:54.180]   situation if you provide your products to a third-party institute and then they work
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:23:01.660]   with lots of people to test them and they don't know anything about it and what comes
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.660]   out of it, right?
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:07.900]   We expected it to be positive, but we had no idea it would be that positive across the
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.900]   board.
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.500]   And I think for the whole space, that is actually very interesting.
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.500]   So the...
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.500]   Okay, thank you.
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:14.500]   That's...
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.500]   Okay, so I got some questions.
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:20.140]   So you're saying, so it's not just the T-shirts as well, but like your heel capsule as well,
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:25.220]   a positive physiology effect on people from EMF?
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.220]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.220]   100%.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.220]   So every time it was tested...
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.220]   Yes, thank you.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.220]   Yeah, I see the certificate for the...
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.220]   Okay.
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.220]   Sorry to interrupt.
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.220]   Okay.
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.220]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.220]   And even the eGiv Institute...
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:42.220]   So the eGiv Institute tests T-shirts, for example, or our hats, caps, hoodies and so
[00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:50.780]   on in a different way than they test our Leelach quantum heel capsule, as an example, because...
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:56.180]   So the eGiv Institute goes very deep in all of these organ functions, as I just described,
[00:23:56.180 --> 00:24:00.780]   but the eGiv Institute's really typically just focuses on, okay, is there any EMF?
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:01.780]   No.
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.780]   And what does it do?
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:08.380]   And then you do that with these measurement devices, if you wear a capsule, it works in
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:12.580]   a different way, because it doesn't block the EMF.
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:21.660]   It harmonizes and neutralizes EMF, and then transmits positive and beneficial energy to
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.660]   the body.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:29.060]   And the way that they measure that is with the heart rate, variability rate.
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:38.860]   And so they basically check on that rate, as well as the autonomic nervous system.
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:46.140]   And so for that, they also, they had 12, I think, 12 people that they did this study
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:52.460]   with, and they've tested, actually, the effects not only after a few hours, but they even
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:57.060]   went beyond that and looked, okay, what does it do if you wear it during the day for a day
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.660]   or for two days and actually kept improving?
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.140]   Wow, okay.
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.100]   So that was great.
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:13.340]   It was actually from 12 people, 11 people had a very, very visible positive effect.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.420]   So we got five stars.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.020]   It was very significant.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.980]   They were amazed, actually, by the results.
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:25.700]   And there was one person where there wasn't any significant bettering.
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.980]   It was basically state the same.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:36.180]   And it is interesting to note that that person didn't have any negative effects of the EMF
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.180]   to begin with.
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:46.100]   So that was kind of interesting, and I know that, because we can combat EMF ourselves
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:50.860]   if we know how, or if we're fully tuned in, it's absolutely possible, right?
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:54.500]   You wouldn't need a T-shirt or a capsule if you're like that.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.660]   Like, Roman, for example, wouldn't need this.
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.820]   It's just unnecessary.
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.580]   And there are other people like that.
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:08.500]   And so this one person wasn't impacted negatively by EMF, and there was also no bettering seen
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.500]   after that.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.660]   So because in that case, just measured EMF, right?
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.420]   If they had measured other things, you know.
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.580]   That guy ought to have workshops.
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:18.580]   Hey.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:24.460]   So my other question is, is for those of us who have never heard of this company, best
[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:30.820]   S-N-I-G-E-F, could you just kind of explain, like, these are, it's not like a, you know,
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.940]   a couple of old guys in a shack, right?
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:38.100]   And these are actual folks that do full-on science testing, and I mean, that's kind of
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:42.660]   what these companies are, these, these, okay, these sort of, yeah.
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.660]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:48.460]   So the EGF Institute is the largest EMF testing institute, independent testing institute and
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.820]   research institute in Europe.
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.860]   And maybe, well, why'd I have no clue?
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.860]   I don't know.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:59.020]   You know, I'm not, it's not really my space to figure out who are all those institutes,
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:03.980]   but they're at least in Europe, the largest, they're out of Dublin and work out of Spain
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.660]   as well, Dublin and in Ireland.
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:15.580]   And yeah, the Basa Institute in Europe is the most respected testing institute for everything
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:21.980]   around bio-residents and biofeedback, and they've developed a testing method also with
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:30.500]   a device that they work with, yeah, to basically check on your organ functions, blood level,
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:35.540]   meridian flow, et cetera, with pre and after.
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:40.300]   So it's, it's pretty profound, and they've been around for quite some time.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:46.500]   They all have a medical background, actually, which is very interesting, but certainly they,
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:50.820]   you know, that's where they kind of started, like the kind of Western medicine approach,
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:57.780]   and then they've all, you know, expanded their knowledge and, you know, looked into alternative
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:03.180]   healing methods and opportunities, and, you know, for many, many years, they've been well
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:09.020]   aware of that, and they're, they're pretty well known in, you know, all of the German-speaking
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.660]   countries, at least they've been featured on TV and all of that.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.660]   Okay.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:14.660]   No, that's great.
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:15.660]   That's great to hear.
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.860]   I know you got to catch a plane, so we're going to have to stop in five minutes, unfortunately,
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:23.740]   because I have so many more questions, but so my main, you know, the main point I want
[00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:27.140]   to kind of emphasize, and if you could just, you know, correct me if I'm wrong, but based
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:34.660]   on your, the testing by two different, accredited institutions indicates that even if it's like
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:41.620]   one of these heel capsules, or just a t-shirt, that it offers full-body physiological, you
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.740]   know, I guess, helper or protection.
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:49.740]   I don't know if protection is the best word, but from the, the, the negative effects of
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:50.740]   EMF.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.740]   So it's like a whole body, right?
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:52.740]   It's not like you got it.
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.180]   Because, you know, like, because if you go to other places, it'll sell like EMF shorts
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.700]   and EMF aprons, and, you know, and so it's kind of like they're telling you you got to
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:05.460]   wrap yourself up in a bubble, but your product is just, any one of these devices offers full
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.620]   body of, you know, the full body effect, right?
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:09.620]   Is that correct?
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.620]   Exactly.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.620]   Wow.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.700]   And certainly to describe a t-shirt, for example, so with that, you cover it.
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.740]   However, you know, all your main organs, right?
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:23.740]   So that is, that is just a good space to wear something like that.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:28.660]   And it doesn't certainly block your knee and your ankle if you just wear that t-shirt,
[00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:29.660]   right?
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:35.620]   But because of the, the charging of, so first of all, the whole impact of EMF is being reduced,
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.460]   even if it wasn't charged, right, that would already be helpful.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:45.020]   But it's now charged with quantum energy, and because of these effects, you're absolutely
[00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.020]   right.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.900]   That, that has a positive effect on the whole body.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:54.620]   So that, that in that point, it doesn't really matter anymore that you don't cover your knee.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:30:00.380]   You're still going to be doing a whole lot better in your knee and your ankles and all
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.380]   over the body.
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.380]   Right.
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.380]   No, that's great.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:04.380]   Okay.
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:08.020]   We got three minutes and there's, okay, I, I got more questions, but I do want to talk
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:14.820]   about the one last thing is you, you are starting a new telegram group link in the video description
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:15.820]   below.
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.060]   So could you kind of talk about your new telegram group?
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:25.500]   And if anyone's interested in finding the website, it's just simply leilaq.com.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.260]   And then you're also going to be on telegram.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:31.420]   So I'll provide the link to the telegram group, but can you just kind of share in your last
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:35.340]   couple of minutes about the new group and, and what do you, you know, what, what do you
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:39.100]   want to do with it and, and what's it for and that sort of thing?
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:40.100]   Absolutely.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.100]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.000]   We got great plans with this group and I'm very much looking forward to that.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.580]   We'll, we'll constantly grow in and we're very, very excited to have people there that want
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.740]   to share and learn.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:57.660]   And it's going to be a collection of different topics and people that we actually want to
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.820]   have in this group.
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:06.060]   And it's really one is the scientific aspect of research and testing and, and application
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:10.660]   of quantum physics and quantum energy and frequencies.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:20.740]   But we want to take in also the world of consciousness and healing and these topics.
[00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:26.420]   And in terms of people, obviously everybody's welcome and invited that's interested in any
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:34.180]   of these topics, but, but certainly we, we want to involve also some of our healers that
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:40.100]   we work with every other healer and naturopathic practitioners welcome as well.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:45.420]   And, and then certain scientists, so we'll, we'll get into interviews, we'll provide
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:50.260]   interviews, we'll provide some contests there and great topics.
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:56.700]   I think there's so much to cover as I'm already said that we have to stop talking here in
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:03.060]   just a few minutes, but yeah, so that that group is really there to share and learn all
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.060]   about that.
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:10.100]   And we, we want to not have this be a very narrow focus, but a broader focus because
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:14.540]   it's really emerging of a few different aspects.
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.540]   All of this here.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.540]   Okay.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.540]   You know what?
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.540]   Thank you so much.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:25.660]   Something that I found to be pretty cool is that there is a, there are products for pets.
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:30.340]   You know, so not only are you introducing something new to the market in terms of quantum
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:37.780]   energy EMF shielded clothing, but you're also providing quantum energy devices for pets
[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:41.820]   as well as heal frequency for dogs, right?
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:42.820]   So there's.
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:51.220]   Okay, so there's way more, you know, opportunity to kind of, you know, spread the energy across
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:56.340]   your whole home to not just the people in it, but to your plants as well as your animals.
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:01.500]   So the only question I've got on, on the dog collars is it's leather and brass.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.620]   So is the energy mostly in the brass?
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.220]   Is that kind of how that works?
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.060]   Yes, that's correct.
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:11.660]   I mean, so the way we use a two step process to charge these objects.
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:20.940]   So there's already a positive vibration also in the lever, absolutely, but the, but the
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:27.460]   brass as you, you know, it holds a lot more of the quantum energy and transmits it in a
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:28.460]   pretty nice way.
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.460]   Okay.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:33.060]   Yeah, I guess in our next chat we could talk about your different frequencies because that's
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:37.980]   not on the website yet, as well as the whole idea of using brass.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.420]   But oh, last question.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.420]   These water bottles.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:45.140]   When I looked at it last night, I didn't say how big they are like, it says what color,
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:48.460]   but are they like 500 milliliters or one liter?
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.460]   They're bigger.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:54.380]   Yeah, they're about between like, they're almost 750 milliliters.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.380]   Okay.
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.380]   All right, great.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.380]   Sorry.
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.380]   I just said some gorgeous shopping.
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.380]   I was like, yeah.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.380]   Okay.
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.380]   But yeah, we're at the top of the hour and thank you so much, Phillip.
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.660]   Is there anything you want to share before you leave?
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.060]   Because I know you got to catch that plane.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:10.220]   So anything you need to share and then we'll drop off?
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:16.820]   Well, just a big thank you again for having me and your interest in this whole space.
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:21.820]   Thanks to everybody watching this and being interested in this and be curious, you know,
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.860]   because this is such an interesting field.
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:29.740]   And I think I want to let you know that there is going to be a lot more of this coming in
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.300]   the next month and years.
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:35.140]   And that goes way beyond what we do because there's so many people working on different
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:42.180]   stuff and one thing I can't really say yet, but there's someone that I really like and
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:49.380]   that I know very well, he's been also working on an interesting product that touches this
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.380]   field.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:55.300]   And also in this group, probably in the next week or so, I will start talking about that
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:35:01.500]   a little bit and introduce that because, you know, we want to support this space.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.220]   And we like when people open up, right?
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.660]   So scientists, you know, often we say, okay, scientists, you know, that their thinking
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:09.660]   is so narrow.
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:14.340]   But there's so many great scientists out there that know that they don't know everything,
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.340]   right?
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.340]   And that there's more out there.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:22.260]   And I think this curiosity and in all of us, if we can activate that again and figure
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:28.860]   out, you know, what's there more beyond just the regular daily life of going to work and
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:34.140]   taking a shower in the morning and then going to bed again, there's so much more to explore.
[00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:40.180]   And I think if more people do that and think about that, I think the world will become
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.300]   a better place.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.260]   And in the end, ultimately, that's what we're here for.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.260]   Yeah.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:50.580]   You know, on that note, I just want to say Aloha Mahalo for spending some time with me
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.580]   this morning.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:54.540]   I look forward to hearing you on Sarah Westall in a week.
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.860]   And thank you so much for your time.
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:35:57.860]   So have a great life.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:58.860]   Thank you.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.860]   I know you're doing the event tomorrow.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:04.180]   I hope that goes well and we'll catch up with you soon.
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.180]   Sounds great.
[00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.180]   Have a great weekend.
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.180]   Okay.
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:08.180]   Aloha.
