[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another carbon 60 video. I am your host K Elmer. And in this video,
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.640]   let's discuss what is the recommended dose for C 60 oil. Now that's kind of a convoluted
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.720]   issue because there's so many different products and there's different approaches towards
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.600]   trying to determine what that recommended dose is for humans. So I thought I put together this
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.640]   little video to compile all the various information that's available, kind of talk about why things
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.480]   are the way they are and we'll just jump right in. Okay, so what is the recommended dose for C 60 oil?
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.840]   First, because this is something you are taking and ingesting, let me just give you the FDA
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.600]   disclosure that C 60 oil has not been evaluated by the FDA and is not approved for consumption by
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.680]   the FDA. C 60 oil is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease and that you
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.600]   understand that by making and consuming C 60 oil that it's experimental and you do so at your own
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.120]   risk, we are the human trial. There's not been one done yet. And so all of this is experimental
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.320]   and yes, you are the human trial. So here we go. Now the short answer for all of you who don't have
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.640]   time, the short answer is this is what I do, which is C 60 olive oil, 10 milligrams per day or two
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.280]   teaspoons per day. Now if you're taking C 60 and MCT oil, now because that oil only contains and
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.120]   can only contain from a saturation standpoint, half as much C 60 because of the length of the
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.640]   fatty acid chain in MCT oil, then you would double it for daily dose of 20 milliliters per day or
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.360]   four teaspoons per day. Boom, that's the short answer. If you'd like to know why and more,
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.200]   keep listening. All right, so let's jump into the actual video here. Now C 60 oil consumption
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.880]   kicked off, as I mentioned, because in 2022, there's this groundbreaking study that came out,
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.600]   everyone refers to as the rat study, the actual title of the study is the prolongation of lifespan
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.920]   of rats by repeated oral administration of C of C 60 following. And what this study did was it
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.400]   actually was the groundbreaking study that said, Hey, by the way, you know, we tried to kill a bunch
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.800]   of rats in a toxicology study. And instead they lived twice as long. So everyone went, wow,
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.080]   let's check this out. And literally in 2012, right after this was released, within a couple of months,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.440]   the first commercial product was already on the market with people trying to sell C 60 oil
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.760]   because of what the study said. But the thing about the study that needs to be really, really
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:34.160]   clarified is again, it was an LD 50 study. And what an LD 50 study means is that it is a toxicology
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.640]   study that tries to determine what is the lethal dose of something to the where at least 50, you know,
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.840]   where 50% of the test subjects die. In other words, it's kind of like one of those OSHA things
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.440]   where they say, Oh, you know, you can, you know, this all these different products that people
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.480]   are eating, you know, they're allowed to have, you know, x x parts per million, you know, as an
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.640]   acceptable level that we won't hurt anybody. And so that's kind of one of those studies where
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.880]   they determine like they try to determine how much of it will kill you. And then they try to do
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.240]   the math and go backwards and say, all right, what's the, you know, allowable amount, because
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.240]   everything in the world that we eat and breathe and drink has an allowable amount of toxins because
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.800]   nothing is pure. Okay, so that's kind of the concept here. And that's why this study happened,
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.360]   you know, in Paris by the French, because they were, they were contracted to go ahead
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.560]   and figure this out. But instead of the rats dying, again, they live twice as long. And that's
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.640]   how this all got started. But the thing about that study that really needs to be clear with
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.160]   everybody is that it wasn't a study to see if the rats could live. They were trying to kill the rats.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.280]   And because they were trying to kill the rats, they gave them a blood load of C 60 because they
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.280]   were trying to see how much would kill them. So the thing about the dosage, now if you read the
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.280]   study, okay, links for everything I'm talking about in the video description below, copy of the
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.760]   study if you want to read it and blah, blah, blah. So now the dosage that they gave those rats
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:04.560]   was they gave them a C 60 dosage of 1.7 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Okay, and then the
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.360]   the oil that they were using had a 0.8 milligram per milliliter saturation rate, which is your
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.080]   benchmark amount of most products on the market will have that 0.8 milligrams per milliliter saturation
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.480]   in olive oil. Okay, we're only talking about olive oil right now. And so how that kind of
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.840]   translates out into some math is that essentially it's 2.1 milligram per kilogram of body weight. So
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.160]   you know, how do you transfer how do you translate the amount of C 60 in an oil, right? And then how
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.920]   do you translate that to how much oil you should have because of the C 60 in it, right? So that's
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.600]   what it is. So the doses that they gave the rats was 2.1 milliliters per kilogram of body weight,
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.920]   and they basically gave it to them orally. Okay, you know, and so the mice or the rats in this case
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.320]   actually had to drink it. Now the thing was, and this is the key thing is that yeah, that's a,
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.280]   this right here, this dosage, this this 0.8, that's normal C 60 oil, nothing special there.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.200]   But how much did they give them? And more importantly, how did they give these rats who live twice as
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.080]   long the C 60 oil that they created for them? Well, this is the thing they gave them one dose
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.640]   per day for seven days. So they front loaded them and basically saturated their bodies.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.320]   They gave them a mega dose every single day for seven days. And then they went after the seven
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:31.440]   days, they only gave them one mega dose per week for two months. And then they gave them
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.440]   one mega dose every two weeks thereafter. Okay, so these rats did not take it daily,
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.920]   like the rest of us are doing like all the humans are doing. So in the study, the rats got a mega
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.040]   dose in seven days, then it tapered off and then it tapered off even further. Okay, and that's
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.960]   really a critical aspect of the idea here is, all right, these rats lived a long time, but they were
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:59.680]   doing it differently. They were taking a huge amount of C 60 oil and they were really taking
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.520]   mega doses of C 60 oil in the first part of the, you know, of the trial and then it tapered off,
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.760]   right? So at no point did the rats ever take C 60 oil on a daily basis like we are. Okay, human.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.360]   So the idea here now, if you take all of these numbers and you translate that down to bigger
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.680]   rats, basically, you know, if you get into some heavy, you know, heavy rats, okay, and you say,
[00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.920]   let's say the average American male is around 200 pounds. How does that translate to, you know,
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:35.920]   a 200 pound human as opposed to a little rat? Now, if you were a 200 pound human, and you look at
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.640]   the amount that if you were a 200 pound human rat in this study, you would have to have been given
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:51.760]   per mega dose six and a half ounces of C 60 oil per day for seven days and so forth, right? Now,
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.200]   what's six and a half ounces? Well, that's half a soda can. A typical soda can in America is 12
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:05.120]   ounces. That's literally half a can of oil every single day for a week and so forth. And if anybody
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.920]   ever tried to do that with olive oil, you can imagine, you know, the fun you would have on the
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.400]   toilet, right? So, you know, it's it's clear that the study does not basically have any way you could
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.200]   take what the study said and then transfer that to okay, so what should humans do? And that's my
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.280]   point. My point here is that this was a study on rats to try to kill them. So the one thing we
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:34.000]   could take away from the study is well, C 60 did an incredible thing. It just eliminated all their
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.080]   tumors and they lived twice as long when they were supposed to have died from the tumors.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:44.320]   And so we know that okay, so this is because this now the dosage amount or the actual saturation
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.360]   rate became the benchmark for the industry. But then now the dosage was kind of like, okay,
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.720]   what do you do now? How do you translate what happened in the study to a recommended dosage
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.640]   on all of these different products that you see on them on the on the market? So the first thing,
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.280]   and these are the different approaches that different manufacturers took. And they're sort of like
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:09.120]   basically there's, you know, different approaches based on the first one was they decided, okay,
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.080]   well, how about the very first manufacturers, the very first set of manufacturers that started
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:21.120]   making C 60 oil in the very beginning, okay, was like Bucky Labs, SES, C 360 for health,
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.320]   purple power, carbon 60 olive oil. These guys were the very first group of folks that
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.440]   literally within months to years, they were producing a C 60 product based on the rat study,
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.080]   trying to, you know, you know, you know, basically take advantage of this new thing, and they wanted
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.520]   to create a product and hopefully succeed. Now the very first approach that they took when they
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.320]   made their products was they decided, okay, we're gonna, we're gonna apply the concept of
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:51.920]   allometric scaling and by body weight. And that's what we'll do is, and they basically
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:58.000]   use the 30% allometric scaling approach mathematics, right, they just applied some math and said,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.560]   well, if the rats took this much, which was, you know, you could, you cannot take what the rats
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.720]   take if you were human, you'd be very sick. So instead, we'll go, we'll do a 30% allometric scaling
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:15.360]   and we'll come up with a dosage recommendation based on some math. And that honestly was a,
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.600]   it was a wag, okay, there was, it was a wild ass guess. But that's what they decided to do,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.920]   and it kind of made sense to everybody. And that's how it took off. So in the very beginning,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.720]   and all, almost all of the different products out there that are all of oil products are going to
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.800]   have that same type of recommendation. So if you go and say, what's the recommended dose,
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.200]   based on whatever you're taking, you're going to see that it's literally one teaspoon or five
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.800]   milliliters is the daily dose that, you know, most companies will recommend. So you can see right here,
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.320]   that, you know, the C360 health carbon, 60 olive oil company, the 660 olive company and the purple
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:55.040]   power company are all recommending that the minimum dose per day is one teaspoon or five milliliters.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.440]   Now a couple of companies have actually gone farther and created a dosage calculator on their
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.440]   websites. So you can actually kind of just play with it depending on your weight, because it really
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:09.600]   comes down to body weight, right, depending on how big of a rat you are. You know, you're going to
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.440]   tick, you're going to pretty much, you know, kind of fall within some of these areas, but
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.440]   they actually have a dosage calculator. So if I walk you through some of these things,
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.560]   let me kind of just show you where the data for this video came from, which was,
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.360]   here's Bucky Labs, they have a allometric scaling, a dosage calculator. Unfortunately,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.520]   right now for whatever reason, when I when I'm making this video, the calculator is inoperable,
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.480]   it's not working. So if we pop over to SES and they have the same calculator, and just say,
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:39.920]   look, okay, so here's SES's dosage calculator on their website, and they're actually the most famous
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.560]   of all the S, you know, of all the C 60 oil companies, because they were the ones that actually
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:50.080]   supplied the C 60 that was used in the rat study, and they've been around the longest of anyone
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.720]   else. So, you know, so they have a lot of street cred when it comes to anything having to do a C 60.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:00.960]   And so the thing about their doses calculator at A, it works. And so you can kind of just put in
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:07.920]   here 200 pound human being, and you just go ahead and run the, you just type in the 200 pound
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.240]   humans, and then boom, you get this, you get this response. So for 200 pounds, they're saying,
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:19.440]   hey, six milliliters or one and a quarter teaspoons of their C 60 oil product. And that's their
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.920]   recommended dosage. So, you know, I think they're kind of going when they came out with the take
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.440]   the one teaspoon, I think they were basically, I think that was the average, I think the average
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.880]   human's like about 180. I'm just using 200 pounds to fit into my scale. So you can kind of play
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.360]   around with this links in the video description below. If you kind of want to take the allometric
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.760]   approach on taking C 60, then I highly recommend going to the SSS site and punch in your weight
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.720]   into their calculator. And based, and it'll tell you right there what you should be taking based
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.240]   on the allometric scaling that all of the original manufacturers did. Now, if you go to the other
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:00.400]   websites, like if you go to C 60, you know, C 360, you go to carbon, you go to all these other guys.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.840]   Basically, they're all just basically copying in it. I think what they did is basically copied
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.160]   what the original guys decided to do mathematically. And they all basically came out and said,
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.720]   ah, it should be one, you know, one teaspoon. So if you go to all of their FAQs and you go to
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.120]   these different websites, that's what they're going to pretty much recommend. So the easiest
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.480]   thing to do is to go over to SSS and just use their dosage calculator. And the only thing to
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.640]   also, you know, if you're looking at, okay, well, is there is there a maximum? Is there too much?
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.200]   And so there is two companies that did say that there is a max that you should not over, you know,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:39.040]   go over and purple power stipulates in their FAQ that use the max you should take is two tablespoons
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.240]   or 30 milliliters or six times the daily amount. That's what they're saying is don't go over that.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:50.560]   The other one was the C 360 health. Their only recommendation on maximum was they state in their
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:56.640]   FAQ that they did do a test. And I think it was on a on dogs where they gave dogs like I'm just
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.440]   guessing now I'm just trying to remember from the days back in the day. But the idea was they do
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:09.280]   state in their FAQ that they have tested 20 times that limit. So 20 times one tablespoon or sorry
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.880]   teaspoon to see if it had any negative effects. And it did not. So they're basically saying, okay,
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.960]   well, we tested it at 20 times what we're recommending. So we certainly, you know, we're
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.200]   confident that our recommendation is sound. And that's kind of what that is. But other than that,
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.320]   I haven't read anywhere else where anyone tried to do a human recommended, you know, recommended
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.760]   dose study. Just it just doesn't exist. So this is the first approach. So if you want to just
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:39.120]   basically take the conservative route, you know, and just kind of go with how much should I be
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:45.760]   taking a C 60 oil, then clearly, you know, just use the the calculator at SES. That's the
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.520]   allometric scaling approach where it's all based on how much you weigh. All right. Now,
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:54.560]   the next thing that you kind of need to think about is the other approach, which is a science-backed
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.560]   approach. And this is I and Mitchell from Wizard Sciences. And he is the he was the one that actually
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.840]   developed all of the products for CC 360 health. And then he spoke off and created his own company
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.880]   called Wizard Sciences. And so in this interview, and this link below in the video description,
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:18.720]   in this interview, he actually goes into great detail. Now, I and Mitchell is just essentially,
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:25.920]   he's a he's a polymer. He's a polymath. He basically is a scientist, right? He's just incredibly
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:33.600]   brilliant, holds multiple patents on C 60, developed multiple C 60 products. And he's also a biology,
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.840]   you know, a biology or basically his quantum biology and a chemistry professor at the University
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:44.400]   of Tulsa. This guy is brilliant. And so he created his own line of C 60 products. And then in this
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:50.480]   interview, he's talking to the guy who's interviewing him about his products. And he goes into great
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:58.560]   detail at the 20 minute mark where he talks for 10 minutes about the actual biology and the
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:05.120]   reactions of their body when you're taking C 60. And how he had kind of initially in the beginning
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.640]   took a lot more than he should have been taking, discovered what the mechanisms of action were
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:16.160]   that C 60 was having on his biology. And then kind of with him tinkering around with it,
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:22.160]   discovered what the optimum dose is and that has become his recommendation. And in a nutshell,
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.640]   you know, you can I highly recommend the 10 minutes of just listening and talk, explain it,
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:33.440]   is really worth the time. But in a nutshell, he explains that it really kicks off the electron
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:40.160]   exchange process in your body. And it could and your muscles will then fire off more electrons
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.120]   than your tendons and other parts of your body can handle. And you can literally hurt yourself
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.440]   because it gives you so much more energy and strength. And it's all, you know, you get more
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.840]   muscle strength, but you don't have ligament strength, and you actually can pull pull things.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.160]   And he's actually had several incidences where he's hurt himself, because he was taking too much
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:03.840]   C 60 and thought he was stronger than he really was. Or you know, his physical body was not able
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.240]   to handle the strength that he was, you know, experiencing through taking C 60 short answer.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:14.080]   Okay. Anyway, that's the 10 minutes right there. So based on what I and has done with his research
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:20.240]   and his just his incredible knowledge about, you know, chemistry and biology, he recommends
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:27.200]   the two teaspoons per day is the recommended dosage for C 60. And based on, you know, I know
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.400]   I am personally, and we've talked about it. So that's why I recommend that I personally recommend
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.200]   the two teaspoons per day, as opposed to going with the allometric scaling recommendation.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.000]   So that's my recommendation. And that's what I do personally, is I take, I follow ions recommendations,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.480]   but definitely if you want to listen to this 10 minutes of this interview, it's totally worth it,
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.240]   you know, and so that's that's that's one approach. You know, it's the second approach that people
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:56.080]   have taken towards doing a recommended dose. So that's the two teaspoons per day or 10 milliliters
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.720]   per day recommendation. Now the other thing too, that I want to kind of clarify, I had a really great
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:07.760]   interview with Bob Greska from C Bob Greska's Carbon 60. And so now this in this discussion
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:14.160]   was a totally different approach, because Greska has cracked the code on synthesizing C 60. And he
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.880]   does it differently than other manufacturers do. And so one of the things that's really amazing
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:25.600]   about his product is that it's a different approach in synthesizing the C 60 and then mixing it with
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.080]   oil than the rat study had done, which is what everybody followed. Everyone followed the rat study,
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.920]   except Bob. Bob went his own direction because he's a little carbon scientist. You know,
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:42.400]   basically, you know, I believe trained at MIT worked for NASA. I mean, the guy is a carbon scientist.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:47.760]   His entire career is about carbon and doing things with carbon. And so he, when he decided to go off
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.800]   on his own and synthesize C 60 in a different way than everybody, he came out with a different
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:18:00.320]   type of C 60 in which the particulate size is literally molecular. As opposed to your regular C 60,
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:07.040]   the particulate size is clusters of molecules. And so the difference in size when you get to that
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:14.240]   level of particulate has a huge difference in, you know, not only it's, well, primarily it's
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:19.200]   bioavailability to your body. Okay, that's in a nutshell. And so now again, I got a link to the
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.360]   video interview. If you want to just listen to the interview of me and Bob chatting about C 60.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.360]   But the idea here is now if you are taking this product and this product only, because it's the
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:35.440]   only one that's like it, then the recommended dosage for a a molecular particulate sized C 60
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:42.720]   product in short is two thirds of a dropper or two thirds of a milliliter per day. That's how
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:48.000]   little you need to take of this because the smaller the size, the more bio available it is.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.400]   Okay, in a nutshell. So that's that. So that's the third approach. So there's three different
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:58.080]   approaches towards recommended dosage. And so again, just real quick is that a bottom line is
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:03.440]   the most conservative one is the allometric approach. The more science based one is the,
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.480]   you know, is the is a science backed approach, which is the two teaspoons per day as opposed to
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:12.960]   one teaspoon. And then of course, if you're taking grascals, it's two thirds of a milliliter per day,
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.960]   completely different product, and it makes a big difference. Now, there's other things I do
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.920]   want to kind of cover with everybody when it comes to recommended dosage of C 60 that you really
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:27.280]   need to be thinking about, especially if you're new to it. Okay, and the first thing about it
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.840]   for everybody that's new to it is to think about, okay, well, if I want to follow along, if I want
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:38.480]   to, you know, basically duplicate the results of the study, the rats, then would I need to front
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:44.080]   load with a ton of C 60 and then tape off and maintain like those guys did. And that's actually
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:49.840]   a recommendation that several companies have made that says, hey, if you want to load, then maintain,
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:54.400]   just like you did, you know, they did in the study, then they are recommending these are
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:20:00.160]   those different companies that I showed you a second ago, that to take two to four times the
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:06.320]   daily dose for the first 30 days, and then kick, then can then kick back to the daily dose. Okay,
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:12.400]   so if you want to do it, and it's only a recommendation, if you if you if you if you want to go that route,
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.480]   it's another thing for you to consider, you know, if you really want to kind of, you know,
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:22.560]   duplicate the, the, you know, the frequency of, of, you know, of taking C 60 and kind of simulate
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.120]   what they did in the rat study, then load up first and then maintain going forward. So
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:32.000]   you would be taking two to four times the daily dose for the first 30 days, and then, you know,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.600]   every day after that normal daily dose. Now the other thing to think about too is a detox reaction.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:43.760]   Now one of the things about C 60, and this was discovered in the rat study, was that C 60 is a
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:50.080]   super antioxidant, antioxidants are like vitamin C, vitamin E, glutathione, things like that.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:59.440]   But the here's the thing, it is a super antioxidant. A C 60 in oil is literally 172 times more potent
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:08.000]   as an antioxidant than vitamin C. So it is hugely more, you know, more potent as an antioxidant.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.800]   So if you are someone who is new to antioxidants, or you're just taking your basically, you know,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:20.400]   FDA recommended daily allowance of stuff, you know, multivitamins, but you are not taking a lot
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:27.520]   of antioxidants already. And you are a someone who may have a high toxic load. If you take this,
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:36.240]   and it's going to start kicking stuff out in your body. What it does is it reduces oxidative stress,
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:40.880]   and what that means is it sponges up all the free radicals, all the toxins in your body,
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.840]   and then of which your body needs to then flush out. And what I mean by that is there's this
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.000]   reaction of your body, your lymphatic system, your digestive system, whenever you're having,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.440]   and basically it's detoxing you at a cellular level, and your body has to then kick in and get
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.080]   rid of all that stuff. And if you take too much, in other words, if you kick off too much,
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:05.280]   it may overwhelm your body's ability to flush it out. And that's the called a detox reaction,
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.160]   and there's a word for it called the Herxheimer's reaction. But the idea here is now be aware and
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:16.000]   have be, you know, consider, you know, where are you in your in your health? And if you've never done
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.440]   any of the kind of stuff like this than before, then I highly recommend you take the most conservative
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:26.400]   approach, you know, and do the allometric scaling one teaspoon per day, and don't just jump into
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:32.000]   the deep end of the pool. Okay, so there is a consideration for a potential detox if you're not
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.880]   used to taking super strong antioxidants. Okay, so that's another consideration. The other
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.200]   consideration which I mentioned earlier when I gave you the short answer is that there is a
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:46.400]   distinct difference in type of oil. So the whole idea now all of these recommendations that are
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.240]   covered in this video are for C60 in olive oil with the exception of gresco, which is sunflower,
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:23:00.240]   but same concept. However, because these, the saturation rate of C60 is much higher in olive oil,
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.280]   it's literally twice as much as MCT. So what would you do if you're taking an MCT product,
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:10.880]   you would want to take twice as much, you understand, because it's half, it's got half as much C60 in
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:16.320]   it. That's the reason why so be aware of the type of oil. Now, if you have looked at C60 products,
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.200]   on Amazon or on the internet, there are literally like, I think 20 different oils people are using
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.880]   everything from pumpkin seed oil to CBD oil, you know, and they're putting C60 in it. So, you know,
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.040]   there's no there, there is nothing for that. I mean, there's no cool recommended doses for
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:36.160]   anything other than olive oil. And then you can extrapolate that to MCT oil. None of the other
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.680]   ones have been kind of really evaluated. Maybe avocado is kind of the same as olive. But yeah,
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:47.280]   so, you know, those are not in this discussion at all. They're kind of like fringe products.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.600]   If you want to take them, hey, that's up to you, but you're kind of guessing at that point. And if
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:56.000]   you're guessing, then go with the conservative approach one teaspoons per day. The other thing
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.920]   about taking C60 oil is do you take it with or without food. And so I get across the board as I
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:07.760]   did the research on this, everyone, all of the different manufacturers agree that taking it without
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.720]   food, it allows you to have greater absorption on an empty stomach. Okay, so that's really as
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:17.840]   simple as that. If you take it without food, you're going to absorb it much better than if you take
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.920]   it with food because, you know, I don't want to get into that, you know, but it's all about how
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.560]   food and your liver works and all that stuff. So anyway, so taking it without food. So I would
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:32.240]   highly recommend that taking the dosage, like I do basically two teaspoons a day, take it without
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:37.040]   food, take it before I have anything to eat, and so forth. Now, the time of day is also something
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.800]   to consider. Now C60, because of what it does, it's going to boost your energy, and you're not going
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.520]   to want to do that at night when you're trying to sleep. So mornings are best. So time of day without
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:53.920]   food, mornings is the recommended time to take C60. And the other thing to think about too is the
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.680]   additives. Now, one of the things about the iron Mitchell products lines, he's got nothing, he's
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:06.880]   got the C60 in olive oil product, but he's also got other products that have C60 in oil. But it's
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:12.480]   got lots of different supplements in it. Live longer labs has different supplements in theirs. I think
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:17.360]   they've got Kirkman and stuff like that. irons got, you know, all these different anti aging stuff. So
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.320]   based on different products, you're going to notice that just not it's just me, the product may not
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:28.080]   just be 60 in olive oil, it may be C60 in olive oil plus all this other stuff. So that all that
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.560]   quote other stuff does have an effect. And if you're already taking some of that stuff or you're
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.640]   not used to that other stuff, then be really conservative because you don't know what all that
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.040]   other stuff is going to do for you if you're new to it. Okay, so watch out for additives. And I
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.360]   mean, additives in a positive way, not like preservatives, but additives like other supplements
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:51.120]   have been added to the C60 oil. You need to be aware that they're there and that if you're taking
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.760]   your dosage, you know, that, Hey, what else is, you know, what is this stuff going to do? Okay,
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:59.920]   so keep aware of that that there are products out there that have a lot more going on than just
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:04.000]   C60 in oil. And the last thing I want to bring up, and this is something that iron Mitchell has
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.760]   himself commented on on multiple interviews is the hermesis effect. And one of the things about
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.600]   our bodies is that we get used to stuff after a while, if we'd continually do the same thing
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.760]   over and over, and then it because we're doing it over and over, our bodies get accustomed to it,
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.080]   and then begin to rely on it. And then you don't have as much of an effect anymore from it. You
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.800]   don't get the benefits as as you would if you were new to something. Okay, so that goes with
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.200]   everything, you know, and so the whole idea is the recommendation from iron. And I also do this
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.320]   myself is to do to take breaks from taking the supplement. And this should be with any supplement
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:41.200]   you take. But to keep in mind, whenever you're taking C60 is that there is a hermesis effect,
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.520]   your body will get used to it. And so you want to kind of take a break. So some people take a
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.840]   break where they just don't take it on on weekends, or they don't take it on on one day a week,
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.600]   or other people just take a break like take a two week break from it every few months,
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:58.160]   whatever, whatever, you know, you know, you want to do. But just keep in mind that doing it
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.840]   for every single day forever is not recommended. You would definitely want to take in that concept
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:09.280]   of the hermesis effect, and only take it or take breaks from taking the C60 oil. Okay,
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.800]   so that's the last thing to consider. I hope this was helpful for you. Again, you know,
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.040]   my recommendation is to see swims a day and take a break every now and then take it in the morning
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.320]   without food. Okay, so there you go. That is the C60 recommended dosage. Everything you're going to
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:28.720]   see covered in this video is in the video description below along with a link to the
