[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another takers Academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and this video is part two of the series
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.560]   What is quantum energy and how does it work?
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.440]   I initially was going to make part two the how does it work part is speaking specifically to the results that
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.780]   We're seeing from all the various studies that is being commissioned by Leila quantum tech using quantum devices and quantum services
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.360]   However, as I was putting together the last video which was the kind of explaining
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.840]   You know what I thought what my theory is on what is quantum energy and the Nate and how does that fit into the nature of the universe?
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.520]   I kind of ran across more and more information that I really felt was important to the discussion and I wanted to share it with you
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.100]   So that's now is this video and I'll be doing the how does it work in part three?
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.320]   So I just jump in I just want to just disclose again. What is what these video this series is all about and it basically covers my
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.040]   theoretical interpretation on what quantum energy is based on existing
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.380]   Theoretical models and the results of studies commissioned by Leila quantum tech
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.820]   So I think that's really important because I did kind of misphrase it
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.300]   Someone pointed that out in the comments or the first video like the disclosure said that I was you know
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.040]   Kind of trying to understand it as defined by but that's not the point
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.860]   That's not the case at all and Leila quantum tech is one of numerous companies out there
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.340]   You know exploring the realms of quantum energy and and and providing those types of services and products to the world
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.020]   And they obviously no one individual company that sells stuff is going to define the nature of the universe
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.020]   You know, that's really not the case more so
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.500]   You know the individual and it was a friend of mine that runs that company
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.420]   You know has his way of explaining it and I noticed that in our telegram chat group
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.140]   There's oftentimes people don't understand
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.980]   You know what he's saying and so I'm very left-brained
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.500]   I started out my journey very much as an armchair scientist
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.140]   My first, you know 30 or so videos are all about science and and specifically
[00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.780]   C60 fullerenes and so I'm very left-brained and I've always been a very big skeptic of all these kinds of you know
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.300]   Like in my mind, you know, these you know, these kind of woo-woo type of of services and woo-woo products
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.220]   And and really have spent a couple of decades truly seeking
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.180]   Understanding and through that doing all of my own research and there was an interesting comment in the last video
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.300]   Someone just kind of you know making fun of the idea that you know, you have to have faith
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.220]   You know, this is all, you know, like just believe whatever you're told and just, you know, believe it on faith
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.300]   And you know, that couldn't be any further from the truth actually for what I'm trying to do
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.240]   Because I think in the in the in the quest for the knowledge the quest for understanding is
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.980]   The opposite of faith. It's like I don't want to just believe what someone says
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.820]   I want to understand it and so the only way to really understand this is to really look at all of the great minds in our
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.580]   In our society and and what have they, you know, what are they thinking?
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.860]   You know, what are they thinking about?
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.820]   Quantum energy about ether about Chi prana all that stuff, you know, and you know
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.460]   How does that fold into our understanding and then what's key here is?
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:18.060]   Yeah, I'm a biohacker and it what's really important to me is biohacking for health healing and longevity and that's something
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.060]   I've just been passionate about
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.340]   and
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:29.580]   I think really honestly if you can understand what this stuff is that's going on because they're so far out in the leading edge right now
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.260]   Leila quantum is in terms of they're commissioning these studies, okay
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.060]   Nobody's done these studies and no one's had these types of devices studied like that
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.460]   And so the results that are coming in are just unbelievably and they're quite remarkable
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.140]   And they're defying existing physics. That's the key
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.620]   You can't explain what's happening with existing physics and that therein lies why i'm doing these videos
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.500]   Is to just open that discussion share what i'm thinking get more than one mind just trying to chewing on it and just saying hey, you know
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.220]   Because here's the thing because of my passion for biohacking
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.300]   I believe that if I can understand or we can really truly understand what's going on here
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.060]   What it's all about and really how does it work and we can unlock
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:23.820]   Uh, you know the the knowledge of how to use it for our own benefit down to our lives and especially in the area of quantum healing
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.500]   Uh quantum manifesting quantum shifting all of these things that are
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.260]   Popping up all over the place in terms of how people are kind of wrapping their heads around this subject matter
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.460]   So there you go. That's my explanation of what's going on
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.460]   Um, and and why i'm doing this and I just really kind of wanted to share that with you because you're part of the you're part of the community
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.860]   And you're part of the whole you know brain thrust of trying to figure all this out and and and specifically
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.860]   How do you use it to your benefit?
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.860]   Uh, and and for your loved ones and so forth
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.780]   So I ran across the more information that I wanted to share with you because I think it really fine tunes
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.700]   The very first premise that I put out in the first video
[00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.700]   Which was that there are three modes of understanding quantum energy
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.780]   And how it works and these three methods of understanding is essentially in today's environment
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.660]   If you look at existing theoretical, uh, you know
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.500]   Models that are out there. You've got the particle physics
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.660]   Aspect of it, which I explained earlier the energy
[00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.620]   Universe has explained
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.940]   You know very briefly. I'm going to get a lot more into that today
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.980]   And then the simulation theory of the universe
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.460]   So let me just kind of kind of fine tune this down because this is what i've been doing for weeks and weeks now
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.420]   Just studying and educating myself on the fundamental principles of physics
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.860]   Which has not been an easy task. Honestly, it's not my i'm not a physicist. I'm not a biochemist
[00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.700]   Um, you know, that's not my background my background as a tinker
[00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.820]   Um, and for the last 20 years just trying to understand everything and really having a deep dive that I've been doing in energy
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.900]   Devices energy work and specifically more so in the world of biological magnetics
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.940]   Uh, so but you know, let's kind of just take a look at these three
[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.060]   And this is what i'm thinking guys, and I just want to share it with you
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.420]   I think it's worth worth discussing and worth understanding
[00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:19.660]   So the very first one, you know, when you look at all three and I have been really thinking a lot about it since I made the first video
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.540]   Uh, if I if we just start with simulation theory
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:31.900]   Now you're looking into that and you go, okay. Well, do I want to spend time on trying to figure out the nature of the universe and how does uh quantum energy devices
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.980]   Pro you know, you know resulting in in in the studies
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.260]   Uh, you know the results of the studies. How are they generating those results?
[00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.420]   Uh, you know, it you can easily quite say well if we really are in a simulation
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.460]   Um, then it's just everything's information and you would just go ahead and tweak the code
[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.340]   And then things change okay in terms of just uh altering mat uh altering matter and so forth
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.380]   Uh, but you know, one of the things I did come across was a recent
[00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:02.220]   Podcast, uh, you know with one of the like again, it's Neil digrass tyson
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.820]   Big-time tv personality in terms of physics
[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:13.100]   And you know, one of the things he was talking about in this podcast where they were discussing simulation theory was they were having this discussion about
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:20.700]   Simulation theory and how the very first, uh, you know, uh intelligent beings created the simulation that we are now living in
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:26.380]   And then within that simulation, obviously like I was saying, you know, you take what we have today go a thousand years in the future
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.380]   Uh, and then how much more advanced would the ai characters be in this simulation?
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:36.140]   We're all living like in a matrix and they were saying you know, and then those ai beings create a simulation
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:42.060]   Those other ai you know, so it just keeps going on and on and on over time and so where would we be would we be?
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.300]   are we the uh
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:51.260]   the like the third or fourth 10 100 millionth generation of ai creating simulations and creating more simulations
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.420]   Or are we the original?
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:08:00.220]   You know and it's what's kind of interesting with his take on simulation theory and what's the probability of us actually being
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.820]   Uh in living in a simulation. So I just in his own words. I think he put it really put it really well
[00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.700]   On what the probability is on whether or not we are truly living in a simulation
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.780]   And now this is a very well respected particle physics
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:20.140]   Physicist, uh, you know, and what his take is and I and I kind of agree with him on this one
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.140]   So let me just go ahead and play that for you
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.180]   They can they have the power to simulate
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:30.140]   That's what they're saying. They're in simulations. No, they have the power to simulate themselves. Okay. Yes
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.700]   They all have to make a simulation. They have that power exactly to simulate themselves exactly
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.580]   Do we have that power now? No, we don't know we don't
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:43.180]   Which means that we can't send it and we can't send ourselves into the future as a simulation
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.940]   Because we have the power yet. So we can't continue the chain. We're so either
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:52.220]   We are the real one right or we're the one in the chain that's still evolving
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:57.020]   To try to then make a simulation within their own world, right?
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.020]   So the odds of us being a simulation goes from a gazillion to one
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:07.580]   I mean to likelihood, right? It flips it flips 50/50
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.900]   Wow, I'm good with that
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:16.380]   That changes my life completely. Yeah, okay. And no longer are your kids gonna say dad. It doesn't matter. We're in a simulation. Anyway
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.620]   No, you got an argument
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.860]   Exactly
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:28.140]   So there you go. It's like 50/50 particle physics at this point or i'm sorry simulation theory is 50/50
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.780]   Whether it's actually the answer to what is the cosmos or not?
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.660]   So I just would like for the sake of discussion
[00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:41.180]   Let's just take simulation theory with a very low probability of 50/50 and just kind of push that off
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:46.620]   Onto the side and we'll just leave that behind and as we explore the true nature of the universe
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.500]   So with 50/50 probability and I agree with that
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.380]   It's now, you know, let's just put that on the back burner as in terms of trying to explain the universe
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.500]   And then we get into particle physics. Okay. Now particle physics is a potential
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.380]   I mean it and then that's the key like I mentioned in the last video
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:08.300]   Could it be that you know all of this stuff is using particles and we just haven't discovered what these particles are
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.860]   And then you know, is that possible?
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.460]   And and so the thing about particle physics and this is the most amazing discovery
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.340]   In the last you know a couple of years was last year
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:24.220]   The Nobel Prize for science went to a couple of scientists who had basically proven the existence of quantum
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:32.300]   Now quantum entanglement is is basically taking in particle physics is the scientists had an experiment where they took a proton
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.700]   And they split the proton into paths and then they separated them by a distance
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.060]   I believe the distance was like and correct me if I'm wrong. I think it was 14 miles
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.180]   So you've got two particles that were you know split proton
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.500]   Two particles they broke it into half
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:51.100]   They took one particle and put it in one lab and they took the other particle and put it in another lab and they had all the equipment
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:56.540]   They're observing both particles at the same time just you know separated with a distance
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.940]   And then they started to do experiments on one of the particles why they're observing the other
[00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.260]   And what they discovered was when they would submit
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:10.540]   Subject the one particle to electromagnetic fields and and cause it to spin in one direction or the other direction
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.700]   But they were exerting a stimulus onto that particle that the other lab
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:20.780]   Instantaneously would watch the other half the other particle that was not being stimulated
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.060]   Do the exact same thing as the one that was
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:28.780]   So in other words if I were to make this one spin to the left then the other half with you know
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.300]   The other half of the proton miles away would spin to the left as well
[00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.700]   That's sort of that's I'm just being really super high level on that explanation by the way
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.540]   And so
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.060]   That was just last year that they got the nobel prize for proving that
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:46.460]   Hey, this you know, you can you can do it as an experiment and it actually happened
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:53.180]   Which meant some really significant stuff in in the world of particle physics because for the first time, you know
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:12:00.860]   It it actually demonstrated where the modern, you know physics and modern science has to acknowledge because of this right
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:05.980]   Experiment and they have to acknowledge that matter is connected somehow through space
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:11.180]   And and that and that and that you know that by itself was you know was basically
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.980]   Not accepted at all. Nobody would you know, nobody would accept that that this was a real thing
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:20.060]   But now it's been proven that matter is connected
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.340]   Um and that that connection
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:31.980]   Implies that there is a field of energy that allows that connection to be sustained or to be in existence
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.980]   Okay, so that so it really kind of really challenged the physics
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.580]   Physicists today because it's like hey quantum entanglements real
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:47.260]   And it implies that that that everything is connected and it's all in one energy field in order for that connection to
[00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.780]   Exist and the other thing that was really interesting was it
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:58.780]   It because of the instantaneous connection of between the two protons during the experiment that the communication between one proton
[00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.980]   And the other proton was communicating instantaneously, which was faster than the speed of light
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.140]   Which is something that einstein
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:11.980]   You know, basically theorize was not possible. So it's really been a huge challenge
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.460]   And and really forcing a lot of modern physics staff to kind of rethink
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:21.020]   The nature of the universe as it relates to particles because in their
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:26.620]   Dogma, you know that should not have happened in other words that you can't go faster than the speed of light
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.140]   You know matter is not connected and there's no energy field out there
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:35.340]   You know that particles all exist independently. So so it really challenged the idea of particles
[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:41.420]   But at you know again at the end of the day there is no explanation in particle physics for what we're seeing happening in those studies
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:47.100]   Bilella, so, you know, I want to just say that you know, hey, you know, they're right at the precipice
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.100]   They're really trying to really, you know
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.540]   Kind of wake up to the fact that there's a lot more going on
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:58.540]   In the nature of the universe than then all of the existing 160 something years
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.300]   That this science has been developed and that they've got a lot more to learn
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:07.020]   Um, and you know, nothing wrong to you academic physicists. I got big kudos to you guys
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:12.380]   Uh, you know for working on this, but I think it really opens up the idea that particle physics is not the end all
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.820]   To explain, uh, you know the nature of the cosmos
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.020]   So i'm just going to leave them off to the side put them on the back burner right now
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:25.580]   Because they aren't the answer to this the you know the questions i'm asking and that leaves us with energy the energy physics
[00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:32.940]   You know that the world and the cosmos and everything we understand is all energy. So one of the interesting things that popped up
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:39.420]   Uh, while I was kind of researching this was I had mentioned earlier, you know in the first video that, you know, dr
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.420]   tenant had come up with the theory of atoms where he basically kind of
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:50.300]   theorized that you know the that the actual particles are not particles, but they're vortices of
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.900]   energy
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:57.980]   Okay, and that the center of of an atom. Let's say that if we want to describe it that way at at this point in time
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:03.740]   Uh, was a micro black hole and that the actual electrons and protons were were just forces
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:11.340]   Of of energy in the form of vortexes and so, you know, that was the micro understanding the quantum level
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:16.940]   Theory of energy being the base particle of matter. Okay, that that that is
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:22.940]   Elemental, you know, it's an element of matter and that it's not actually matter. It's it's actually energy
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:29.980]   Okay, and so that was the micro that's the quantum explanation, but what was interesting though is that now I kind of ran across in research
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:35.100]   Something called space vortex theory, and this is credited to a physicist
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.580]   And his name is paraham sa tawari
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.580]   And he's a physicist in india and he came up with years ago
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.140]   He came up with a theory called space vortex
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.540]   in which he had the same
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:55.900]   concept that tenant has now and I think that this probably was the inspiration for tenants theory was
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.020]   Tawari's theory was the same concept
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:05.340]   Which was there's two fundamental forces that he you know, if you just observe nature and that's the spin, you know
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:11.660]   The spin of of energy and there's usually a spin going right and a spin going left, right
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:16.540]   Again, simply if you go to the north pole versus the south pole of the of the planet
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.500]   You know, the water will spin down the drain in one direction
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.860]   And if you go to the other
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:27.260]   Southern hemisphere of the planet the water will spin any other drain and you see that throughout nature and his height in his theory
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:34.300]   Was that that's that is how all of space works at the macro level of understanding that there's a concept here
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:40.620]   In which in his physics and he's a physicist and he worked out all the math behind it and that there was a centrifugal
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.900]   You know spinning vortex and a central petal
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:49.260]   Spinning vortex and they come together and that was the fundamental energy fields, right?
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:56.220]   This basically he was saying that it also suggests that a fundamental state of cosmic energy called the fundamental article of matter
[00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.540]   Creates the electron and the energy fields that govern the universe. In other words, the base
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:07.900]   Forces that drive the universe are these two forces of centrifugal
[00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:14.860]   Energy vortex spin and central petal energy vortex spin and that's how all of the cosmos was created
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.300]   And that's how it works. And so what's interesting here was
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.860]   That to worry his theory covers the macro
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:28.060]   You know the cosmos how the cosmos using the same principles of
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.740]   dynamic energy vortexes as tenants
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:37.740]   Which was the micro and so you know what kind of this implies to me if you take a look at
[00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.980]   Tawari's work and you look at and you look at history and you look at tenants theory
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:49.100]   You've got this unified vortex theory. This is the thing that Einstein and all the particle physics have been searching for
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:56.060]   Forever which is and a theory that explains how the cosmos works and the quantum world work
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:01.500]   You know finding something that reconciles those two because if you throw gravity in there the whole thing goes
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.100]   Just it doesn't work
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:09.980]   But you take gravity and you take time out of that equation and you say hey the world and the nature of the universe is purely energy
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:16.300]   And there's only two forces of this energy and it's all based on how these two things interact with each other
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.820]   And that's the basis of matter and that's the basis of the universe
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:25.660]   You've got a unified vortex theory here made up of the macro understanding of the energy
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:32.380]   Universe and a micro understanding of the energy world which guess what that's called unafield unified field theory
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.340]   But this would be I would call unified vortex theory
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:40.460]   And so that's kind of the interesting things you combine these two theories and you kind of have the explanation of what
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:46.940]   What is you know the nature of the universe from an energy standpoint and how does that and and once you understand that there you go to
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.300]   How does it work?
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.740]   And so my question to everybody out there and the wonders about this is hey
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.420]   Do you see this in in everyday life and the answer is absolutely?
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.580]   Everything you see in nature is a vortex
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.580]   So could these two gentlemen be right and I'm leaning towards yes
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:07.580]   You see this in the cosmos and you see this in living life forms
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.660]   You see this in our weather you see this you know a tornado is a vortex
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.060]   And we see this everywhere we go
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:16.700]   And so the the reason these two gentlemen
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:25.340]   I'm really leaning towards them being right and that this is really the explanation of what is our nature of the universe is we're living in an energy
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.660]   universe
[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.380]   That's governed by these two forces of spin, which is central petal and central future
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:38.300]   Now the other thing that really kind of hammers this home for me is the work of Walter Russell
[00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:43.020]   And so, uh, you know, I really never really dug deep into Walter Russell
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.340]   And what's interesting is that during the research period where I was putting together my thoughts
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:52.300]   Uh for this video series, uh, you know, this I don't know if you watched joe rogan
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:57.980]   But the recently there was an actor his name is terence howard and he came on the joe rogan, uh, you know podcast
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.820]   And I was I watched joe rogan
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.900]   And he was talking about Walter Russell and uh, and I was and I was kind of like
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.020]   Everything he was saying was everything that I had been researching
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:12.620]   So I kind of dug into Walter Russell a little bit and what's interesting about Russell and in this guy is
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.980]   He's not a physicist this guy lived a while ago
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:21.420]   And he's basically an artist and but he kind of his story is amazing
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.620]   And I won't get into this. Uh, I won't make this a Walter Russell video
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:30.220]   But bottom line though is he came up with his own theories based on what he would see in
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.580]   Trances and I know that sounds bizarre, but that's how the story goes
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:38.460]   And so what he was basically coming up with this entire cosmology this understanding
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.660]   Of the universe and everything in it, you know, his quote
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.100]   You know, I would say that unified vortex theory
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.900]   Equals Russell cosmology based on everything i've seen in red
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:57.260]   And the idea though was that the universe a universal the cosmology is a universal invisible omnipresent medium
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.140]   That permeates all space and material bodies
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:04.220]   Russell described it as a supreme source of all creating things
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:06.940]   Okay, so again, you've got the energy universe
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:13.660]   And that the cosmology that Russell had come up with is in his theory of the nature of the universe
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.140]   If you really look at his work
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:21.660]   It's really quite profound because it really kind of ties in the work of to worry
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:29.100]   You know tenant and all of the individuals that have supported the idea that the world or they're not the world, but the universe
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:35.900]   Is energy based and not particle based and even more so one of the things that's interesting about Russell's work
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:41.980]   Was at the time, you know, as I mentioned earlier back in like 1869, you know, uh, demetri
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:47.340]   Mendeleev came up with the initial periodic table of elements based on particle theory
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.700]   Okay, and so this is how it looks today is a periodic table elements
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.380]   You guys have seen this a thousand times and everything's based on particles
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.140]   Um, and they're all organized by classes of elements
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:21:58.700]   Okay
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:05.660]   But the thing that was different about what Russell did was in his view of the elements as he has energy
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:11.340]   Okay, that you know that they're not particles that elements represent different levels of energy
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:19.580]   And you know, which is basically fundamental to what is a particle particle is energy and then so how is that
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:26.140]   Uh, you know, how is a particle energy in other words, how does that uh represent itself as as energy
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:31.020]   And so one of the things that's interesting about Walter Russell's table of periodic elements that he came up with
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:36.300]   Which he basically said, you know, hey, uh, you know, these all the elements are just manifestations of energy
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:41.420]   Um, and the energy is driven by by frequency and he kind of broke it into nine different octaves
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:48.140]   And all and how all of the different elements fell within the octaves meaning frequency really made a difference between whether or not
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:52.140]   Uh energy, uh, uh, basically manifests itself as matter
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:57.980]   Uh, as a carbon, uh, you know element as as opposed to uranium and everything right?
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:03.900]   So all these different elements on the periodic table were arranged based on the frequency of that energy
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.740]   Uh of those, you know, how the men are the particles represented themselves as energy
[00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:11.500]   And so he broke it into nine octaves and said, hey, you know what by the end of the day
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.940]   You know elements are actual, uh, energy
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:20.700]   And energy can be influenced by sound in fact sound is what produces sound
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:27.340]   Equals frequency equals vibration right and that vibration frequencies are what determines whether or not
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:31.500]   These little energy vortexes manifest themselves as different elements
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.620]   Which is wild, uh, and which is probably why you've probably never seen this periodic table
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:40.940]   Because of course all the particle physics, uh, physicists were just
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.180]   Totally not, you know, they were totally not on board, uh, with wall to rustle
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.380]   You got a tremendous amount of criticism because he wasn't a physicist
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:55.580]   It wasn't a scientist, but he came up with this cosmology and what's the most fascinating thing about wall to rustle
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:02.220]   Was that he had this experience? You know, basically he said, hey, you could basically based on the frequency
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.540]   of of
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:09.740]   Matter it would matter would would basically is defined by frequency and so
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:12.780]   What's interesting again is that
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.500]   back in 1927
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.940]   Um his theory was put to test
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.620]   And so and it was put to test by one of the major companies
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:27.740]   Of the time and still is which is westinghouse, you know, they build, you know nuclear reactors now
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.460]   But back in the day they were the westinghouse lamp company
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:35.580]   And so one of the things that they did was westinghouse decided to test
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.220]   Walter rustle's theory that
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:46.540]   Matter was energy and energy matter, right could be manipulated through frequency and and not just frequency
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:52.620]   But specific to rustle's cosmology. It's manipulated by geometry
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:57.500]   and by frequency and the frequency in the form of electromagnetic
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:05.580]   Uh fields and so now I found this really interesting lecture by a guy named tobi groats
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:11.260]   And I believe it was back in the 80s maybe based on how he looks in this video
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:16.620]   There's no time stamp on it. So how he looks in this video compared to how he looks now and he's a real old guy now
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:20.620]   Uh, you know kudos to him looks great, but he lays a young man in this video
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:26.060]   So i'm guessing it was probably back in the 80s and he was presenting the work of walter rustle
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.260]   uh
[00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.260]   in a conference called the uspa conference, which was hosted by
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.220]   uh the psychotronics folks and this is a
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:38.060]   A group of individuals that you know, just basically alternative scientists
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:43.980]   And he basically was giving a a lecture in during the conference and it's been posted on the internet
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.300]   And so I wanted to play to you
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.140]   uh snippet of his
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:54.060]   Of his lecture where he talks about the westinghouse experiment and just discuss real quick here how
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:26:01.180]   Remarkable the findings were of the experiment and and what that means to the idea of quote
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:07.260]   Are we living in a universe made up of particles or are we living in it in a universe made up of energy?
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.620]   And so here we go. This is the uh, this is toby groats
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:16.620]   Talking about walter rustles experiment at the westinghouse lamp company in 1927
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:20.940]   We decided that we were trying to duplicate one of rustles experiments
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:26.300]   Russell reported that he was able to take oxygen and hydrogen to make nitrogen
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.540]   And it's reported in this book, but we you know, we didn't actually believe that
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.940]   I mean, we didn't have no reason to doubt him. This is a man a great man of high integrity
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.020]   But uh, when you're approaching it from a scientific point of view you want to find the facts
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.620]   And the fact of the matter is that we found a document
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.540]   from
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.780]   one of the premier builders of nuclear power plants westinghouse corporation
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.900]   Westinghouse corporation september 20th 1927
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:59.100]   reported on the result of one of rustles test in which he took a sealed quartz tube
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.460]   which had five
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.820]   Ccs of water in it water vapor in it
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:12.860]   He took that water vapor sealed in other words is just hydrogen and oxygen. That's all that's in the tube applied the magnetic fields
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.900]   And when he was through with the experiment
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.700]   There was 69 nitrogen
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.260]   For other inert gases. So he started off with hydrogen and oxygen
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.180]   H2o
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.260]   And all of a sudden 70 percent of its nitrogen or other inert gases
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.180]   So where did the nitrogen come from the nitrogen came from
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:38.380]   A term he did not like to use a transmutation of hydrogen and oxygen into nitrogen
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:43.580]   He did it in 1927 at westinghouse laboratory
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.780]   So
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.900]   The only answer to that or the response to that is wow
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:54.460]   Because that's not possible in particle physics. You can't take one
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:28:01.900]   Substance and make it into something else, uh, you know, which is using uh, electromagnetics and geometry
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:07.980]   And so what's interesting about the westinghouse experiment is that it proved rustles theory
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.580]   That elements are energy and energies influenced by frequency
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.620]   And and geometry
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.740]   But then the other thing too is that if you watch the rest of this lecture
[00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.700]   You'll find out that growths his team had
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:26.380]   Tried to replicate the westinghouse experiment and they decided to try to create fluorine
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:33.340]   Using walter rustles principles in the exact same manner that westinghouse had and they actually were able to
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:41.660]   Produce fluorine from oxygen and hydrogen. So in particle physics, is that possible? No in
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:48.060]   Energy physics is that possible? Well, this demonstrates that it is possible and that maybe our understanding
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:55.260]   Of the universe is not or not i'm not well, it's not fully correct and there's a lot to learn and therefore
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:58.540]   I have now really based on this research
[00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.980]   and very much so in the
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.940]   belief at this moment
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:08.620]   You know reserve the right to change my mind as I learned more but that we really are
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:14.540]   Living in an energy universe that everything is energy and it's influenced heavily
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:20.380]   By vibration and other forces and so again, that's the key to unlocking quantum healing
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:25.740]   Is understanding how this works and so I am now completely on board with the energy
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:31.020]   Universe at this stage based on the just just the rest of the research that i've been doing
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:36.140]   And but there's one thing that's actually missing here and I think that's really important because it doesn't really come up a lot
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:40.700]   And so one of the things I want to just kind of briefly touch on and there's tons and tons of videos
[00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:47.580]   About consciousness and this is not going to be that video, but I want to just have one slide where I just basically kind of just say
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:51.420]   yeah, okay, so uh the Russell cosmology the
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:56.060]   Tawari and tenant unified vortex theory, you know, uh theory
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:30:00.140]   These are all theories by the way, you know, they're all they all kind of kind of go
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.860]   Yeah, okay, they really support the idea of an energy universe
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:08.700]   But then where's the role of consciousness in there and how does that play so if you and so let me just kind of just share with you
[00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.500]   something I think that is is really profound is that
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:20.060]   Can consciousness equally matt, you know, uh, basically manipulate matter? Okay, if matter is energy and consciousness is what?
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:28.140]   What is consciousness? Well, it's it's it's a form of energy. It's a it's a frequency and and can consciousness itself also
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:34.380]   Manipulate matter, you know, which is really important if you're starting to get into you know quantum healing and and all that
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:38.940]   And so I do want to point out a couple of things that in current science today
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:44.140]   The role of consciousness is very much in play. There's two different effects
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:49.820]   I did a video called the science of intention where I went into this quite deeply and pulled up the papers on it
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:53.820]   You know the established medical, you know, it's not medical, but established science
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:31:00.300]   Understanding of what the observer effect is and what the placebo effect is and why every time the you know
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:06.460]   NIH studies have a have a study they've got to actually take into account observer effect and placebo
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:13.980]   In order to justify their results and so in short the observer effect is and this has been proven in quantum science
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:18.780]   okay, and you know particle science is that when a
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:25.900]   Technician or or you know any scientist is actually conducting an experiment at a quantum level
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:33.660]   They their act of observing the experiment will change the results
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.620]   Of that experiment. It's called the observer effect
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:44.060]   It's very well documented. There's multiple papers on it and it simply implies that the consciousness of an individual will have a
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.580]   deterministic
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:50.940]   Change to the outcome of an experiment and so that's why they have to have what they call double blind
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:55.180]   In other words, there's a when they say when you hear the words double blind. What does that mean?
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:32:01.900]   Well, it means that the actual people conducting the experiment don't know when they're actually using
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:09.020]   You know, let's say in the example of Leila quantum tech. There was this really great experiment done by dr. Beverly Rubik
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.580]   testing the effects of
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:17.820]   The quantum block on individuals who are exposed with emf and so part of that experiment was they used the sham block
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:22.460]   So they had a real block, you know quantum block and then they had one that was just not charged
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:27.660]   It was just a plain old couple of plates of you know aluminum and some rods, but it wasn't charged
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:33.660]   So it wasn't a block, but it was a sham block and and even Rubik didn't know which block was the charged one
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.300]   And so she did her experiments and that's called the double blind
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:43.580]   You don't want the observer the actual person conducting the study to know when you're actually using the real one or the or the or the
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.620]   Quote the fake one and then you know and in medical studies
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.700]   They also do the same thing where you know the the doctors that are doing the experiments
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:54.780]   They don't know when they're actually administering the actual drug or a fake drug
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:33:01.340]   You know the water pill they they're not allowed to know because science recognizes the fact that consciousness affects results
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.460]   And so that's why it's called double blind the patients don't know
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.620]   The participants of the test don't know and the people doing the test don't know
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.260]   When they're using the fake one or the or the real one
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:17.820]   So that when they you know gather the results and then they feed that back in they want to have the cleanest results possible
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:23.580]   So that there's no external influences and that's a recognized thing called the observer effect
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:28.060]   Which is why everything's double blind. Now. There's also the other effect of the placebo effect
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.460]   Like how is it even possible for you know people to be given a sugar pill, right?
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.500]   Which you hear about all the time if you read if you if you study studies
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:40.300]   And people actually take a sugar pill. They're told that it's the actual experimental drug
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:45.260]   And they have a biological physical reaction to the sugar pill
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:49.340]   That's exactly the same biological physical reaction of the people that took the the drug
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.860]   You know the actual drug and how is that possible when they didn't get the drug?
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.860]   But they actually had a physical response
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:59.820]   That's the same as the person who took the drug and that itself is called the placebo effect
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:04.460]   It's the power of that individual's mind to believe that they were getting the drug
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:08.140]   And that their their thoughts their consciousness actually
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:11.500]   Produced their effects that the drug was supposed to produce
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.620]   And so now again, that's another accepted
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:19.180]   Part of current day science and they actually whenever they're doing studies
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:23.820]   Not only do they have to do double blind studies to counteract the observer effect
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.340]   But they also have to mathematically calculate the placebo effect
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.900]   Which could be as high as 30 percent of your participants
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.260]   Could actually have a placebo effect and they have to take that into account
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:39.740]   In order to kind of figure out what the actual real results of the study were because of the power of our consciousness
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:45.340]   And that I think is such a important aspect of understanding the nature of the universe because
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.900]   Not only is it energy
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.700]   You know like it's basically an energy universe, right?
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:54.620]   But it's also driven by consciousness and that's my point
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.940]   So just to give you a few examples for any of you that are interested in kind of learning more about this
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.900]   You know if you look at the work by dpac chopper
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:06.300]   He's written a couple of books called quantum healing his most recent book is quantum biology
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:12.860]   Where he talks a lot about the impact of a person's thoughts on on their health
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:18.700]   And on their physiology and he just gives tons and tons of of examples in modern science
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.100]   So how that's been manifesting in modern science
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.700]   There's also the work of lin tagred where she kind of came up with this process
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:31.740]   Called the power of eight and how they've been using the consciousness of individuals to manifest changes in in you know
[00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.740]   For people that require healing
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:36.940]   And so uh, and that's a really great, uh, you know study
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:42.380]   There's a book on that and videos about the power of eight people using consciousness to to man
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.540]   You know to not just manifest but to actually
[00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.580]   You know effect change in physical things
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.460]   And then there's of course, you know, wim hoff if you you know
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:55.980]   Obviously had have heard of this gentleman called wim hoff and he's got the power of breath and he's come up with this entire
[00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:59.340]   Uh, you know process by which he's tuned himself
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.820]   to do things that
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.420]   modern day
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.100]   Science says is impossible and he does it over and over and over again
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.820]   So wim hoff is also known as like the ice man
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.340]   Uh, you know, he I think he climbed everson shorts and t-shirts and like that
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.980]   And so he's just done things that are just absolutely
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:21.340]   Impossible by our current definition under the world of modern science
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:27.180]   But he's out there doing it and he's doing it all the time and he's been he's become quite popular because of his ability to
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.100]   basically
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.900]   Using his consciousness change his body
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:36.220]   So that his body can do things that you know other humans would die immediately just die
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.380]   And he just goes out there and just does this stuff
[00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:43.500]   And it's just amazing how this individual has been able to do that just by his own consciousness
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.740]   And lastly is the power of chi
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:50.380]   And so for those of you who have ever really looked into, you know, chi masters or chi kung masters
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:54.780]   And martial artists and things like that they do stuff all the time
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:37:02.540]   That is unbelievable again impossible, you know, based on our current understanding of the human physiology, you know, like that's not possible
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:06.140]   Well, it is possible. They're doing it and that's the power of their consciousness
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.500]   And I think one of the most profound examples of that is this one guy
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:15.580]   And there's a documentary on internet on the internet, uh, it's on youtube about this one
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.820]   chi kung master
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.300]   Uh, I think it was in hong kong or something
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:25.500]   But it's like a really old is like way back in the 70s where they did a documentary about this guy
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:30.380]   And let me just kind of show you a couple of things he could do and this is not a magic trick
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.740]   This is a documentary filmed back in the 70s
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:38.060]   They didn't have cgi back then and all that and they filmed him doing stuff that is not
[00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.980]   Possible and cannot be explained under particle physics
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:48.140]   But if you start to understand the world of energy physics and you start to understand the role of consciousness in energy physics
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.820]   Then it's basically explains it quite well. So let me just kind of just play this
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:55.580]   Well, uh, I just took a couple of snippets out of the documentary to show you examples
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:38:02.780]   Of what this individual is capable of to kind of demonstrate to you that and that consciousness can drive
[00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:06.940]   You know the matter basically, you know, actually make
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:14.140]   Changes to matter based on consciousness and that's only possible right if the world is universe or the universe is energy. So here we go
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:22.300]   He then took our newspaper outside and showed us how she can also be used to set things on fire
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:48.940]   When he heard we'd shown this footage in public. He was very upset and refused all our future efforts to contact him again
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:54.060]   As the years passed we sadly resigned ourselves to never seeing him again
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:39:01.180]   He invited us all out to lunch at his local where he tried to push a chopstick through the table
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:08.620]   He couldn't get it through the formica surface. So he came up through an inch of wood from underneath
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:22.060]   Okay, so I got those snippets backwards in terms of chronell and chronology
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.020]   but
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:30.140]   The example that I wanted to show you was an individual who could tune his consciousness to manipulate energy
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:33.740]   In two ways he could literally start a fire
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:39.900]   With his consciousness, you know through quote she energy and the other thing was he could manipulate matter
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.340]   he could take an item of wood a chopstick and then
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:46.060]   Push that through another
[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:52.300]   Physical material object called formica and you know in particle physics, that's not possible
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.660]   But if everything is energy and it's not really physical
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:40:01.420]   It's not solid because he could use his consciousness to manipulate the energy that of these part
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:06.460]   You know, that's not energy point. No, they're not physical particles or energy particles that he could literally
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:16.300]   Use his consciousness and and make a change to physical matter by being able to just push a chopstick through a table
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:20.140]   Let alone start a fire and so that's pretty wild stuff
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:27.340]   But it really supports the idea that the world and the universe is energy and not physical matter
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:33.020]   And so lastly, I just kind of want to leave you with this this saying and I kind of want to put it in the context of what i'm trying to
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:37.660]   To convey and and my theory. This is my theory my humble opinion
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:42.860]   You know feel free to disagree, you know, skepticism is great, but this is where i'm going
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.860]   This is what I think is really the true nature of our universe and why
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:50.700]   And and what is quantum energy and you know, which is essentially the energy, right?
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.660]   That it makes up the field
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.940]   Is the quote from Nikola Tesla and you've probably heard this several times
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.660]   I know that philip has mentioned this several times in interviews
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:03.340]   But Tesla once said if you want to find the secrets of the universe
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.620]   Think in terms of energy frequency and vibration
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:11.260]   And when you really look and and this is what i've been spending weeks and weeks on lately
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.100]   Is to understand what does that mean?
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:17.820]   What did Nikola Tesla mean by that and what it really comes out to in my mind is that
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:23.660]   If you want to find the secrets of the universe think in terms of energy frequency and vibration
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:27.660]   And consciousness. I think tesla left out the consciousness part
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:32.300]   You didn't spend a lot of time on consciousness, but I really believe that's the fourth
[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:38.140]   Element of understanding the universe and when you say well, what's what does he mean or what what is you know
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:44.060]   What could have tesla meant by energy? Well, it's really the aether the ether all around us call it qi
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.980]   What a call whatever you want, you know, i'm gonna go with aether, uh, you know, obviously
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:54.380]   Laila quantum tech uses the word quantum energy, but it's really the the the etheric energy
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:58.540]   Of of the universe, right? It's just all around us and that's kind of what
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:02.860]   I think tesla was really referring to was was electromagnetism
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:08.300]   But also the idea of of you know that being a form of energy, which is separate than ether
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.780]   Uh, but there's ether and electromagnetic
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:15.980]   Energy, which is what I would believe is the definition of energy in tesla statement
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:19.180]   And then when you look at the idea of frequency
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:23.740]   Then you're also looking at sound right and that's kind of the wall to rustle cosmology
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:28.700]   Which was using sound but sound is also a frequency and then of course vibration
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:35.900]   Which if vibration is through like if you understand simatics all vibration all frequencies, uh, generate a
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:40.300]   Uh, you know, uh, basically geometry and that's where the rustle cosmology
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:45.500]   Really folded that geometry as part of the overall understanding of the universe
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.260]   And then of course, you know consciousness again, which I think consciousness is the frequency
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:53.820]   So it literally could be where frequency, uh, is sound and consciousness
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:58.540]   But since Nikola tesla never really got into the consciousness aspect, I think it's it's part of it
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.780]   But that's it there. That's it guys
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:04.940]   What is quantum energy? Well quantum energy is ether
[00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.540]   But it's also the energy, you know, but it's also, um
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.740]   Well, it's energy of everything actually
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:16.380]   Uh, and then the idea of here is how do you manipulate that and that's what's key here again?
[00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:19.180]   It goes back to my whole point. How do I use this in my day-to-day life?
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.060]   Well
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:22.700]   If we understand that everything's energy, then how do we manipulate it?
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:26.700]   Well through sound and geometry and frequency and so forth
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:31.820]   So that kind of wraps up where I really believe at this point and this is my theory that
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.980]   ether
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:38.700]   Is the fifth element of of the universe? It's part of everything
[00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:42.860]   And it's actually this, you know, like the the aerevetics called it akasha
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.700]   But ether is literally the fifth element and it's comprised of
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:51.500]   All of the energy and how to manipulate it is through geometry electromagnetic
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:57.500]   Uh forces and energy as well as sound and so there you go. So that's it right there guys
[00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:00.540]   I just really wanted to share that with you and kind of just, you know, give you more
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:07.260]   Uh, you know things to think about and and more avenues of research for those of you trying to follow this now part three again
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:12.140]   Now i'm pushing off the how does it work part, but in part three, I'd like to get really it into the
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:19.260]   Actual results of all of the different studies. There's well over 16 now that Layla has done and exactly what is the
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:23.420]   Within the context of the energy universe, um, you know, how does it work?
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:29.100]   What's driving those results and I kind of kind of figured it out where it's like those biological processes
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:33.260]   Uh, they're driving atp and that atp then is driving in transportation
[00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:39.180]   And then also too the the consciousness aspect of it and how to all of that fold up and how does this explain?
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:43.900]   The results and that's really the key here because we can understand how it explains the results
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:47.340]   Then we could use that to create more different results in different ways
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:52.380]   Uh, to benefit our lives and the last, you know, how do you measure qe and why does never one feel it?
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.220]   And that's a real important aspect of it as well. And then how does that all fold in the quantum healing?
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:57.820]   So that's going to be part three
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:03.980]   So thank you very much for uh for watching this video. I hope it was educational and uh, if you want to learn more about
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:07.900]   My work you can find me at the tingers academy. That's my blog. Of course
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:12.540]   I got the youtube channel if you enjoy this type of content like and subscribe, but thank you very much
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.700]   I hope you gave I gave you something to think about
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:21.260]   Uh, and I'd love to know if you agree disagree or whatever, please comment below, but that's my theory
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.340]   This is my humble opinion
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:30.060]   As to what is the nature of the universe and what is quantum energy and that concludes this aspect of the video
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:33.900]   Uh series and we'll be getting into the how it works in part three
[00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:37.900]   So thank you very much for sticking around and have a great day aloha
