[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   Aloha and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and this video
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.080]   is the first installment of a new series called Tinkers Academy Product Reviews. So we're going
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.280]   to talk about a product called Silent Nights from a company called Lightwave. And before we begin,
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.080]   let me just do a little disclaimer. Appreciate your patience. Please note that the following video

[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.320]   video, all reliance on the information provided. So let's get right into it. So what is Lightwave?
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.480]   Well, it's a company that has product lines that are based on the concept of phototherapy.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.160]   And what phototherapy is is simply bio-photon modulation. That's the fancy term for basically
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.680]   saying light therapy. And over decades and decades and decades, scientists have known
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.880]   that the human body and all biological organisms are affected by light. We actually produce light.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.080]   We use light. It's an energy source and energy is frequency and all of that. So it's really,
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.320]   really important on how if you modulate the right levels of bio-photon, you can literally
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.080]   help people with healing and wellness and that sort of thing. So it's a really well
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.200]   established science in the healing arts. There are lots and lots of different products and devices
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.480]   on the market that fall into the category of phototherapy. And some of them are lamps. And
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.480]   some of you may have probably heard of the more popular ones like red light therapy,
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.040]   UV therapy and so forth. And this is just one of the products in that channel in terms of
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.560]   phototherapy. Now the way that Lightwave does it is they do this thing where they created these
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.960]   patches. And so I'll kind of just show you, here's a little quick video off of their website. Fair
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.880]   use warning here. I just want to say. And so let me just kind of just share with you a description
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.200]   by Lightwave as to what their product is and how it kind of works. And then we'll kind of get into
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.720]   the more nitty-gritty detail. So here we go. Humans actually emit infrared light,
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.760]   which can be seen with night vision devices. We've known for centuries that Light has many
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.600]   effects on the body. Lightwave's phototherapy patches use Light to stimulate the body's
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.840]   natural healing systems, providing specific health benefits. Here's how the technology works.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.400]   First, a patch is applied to specific points on the body. Where the patch covers the skin,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.880]   infrared light emitted from the body is reflected back into the tissue. This stimulates the skin,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:02.000]   which in turn stimulates specific regions of the brain. The brain then taps into the body's own
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.440]   natural flow of energy and the ability to heal itself. Let's take a look at why this is important
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.800]   on a cellular level. For example, a number of our patch products help counteract free radicals,
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.560]   oxygen molecules that damage cell proteins and contribute to visible signs of aging.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.400]   I'm just going to leave it right there and the video mentions other products. And so I just want
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.440]   to make a note that I'm reviewing one of many of the products that come in the form of these
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.480]   patches. And the one I'm reviewing obviously is called silent nights. So that's the idea here,
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.440]   is that it basically, and this is the description on the website of what that actual patch is
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.600]   comprised of, and it basically says inside the patches is water, oxygen, glucose, and plant-based
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.000]   amino acids sealed between two pieces of plastic. And these materials are in crystal form the size
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   of a nanometer, which is really, really, really tiny. When the light from our aura, which is
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.720]   essentially our infrared biophotons that our body emits, hits these crystals, it modifies that
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.400]   light and changes that frequency and mirrors it back onto the acupuncture points. So, you know,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.720]   uniquely, this is another modern science that also aligns with Chinese traditional medicine
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.760]   in terms of how the meridians are set up, you know, they are not set up, but exist in our bodies.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.640]   And so it's taking advantage of that entire energy flow mechanism within our bodies
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.120]   to induce frequency back into our bodies by using our own body's energy to do so. Very,
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.280]   very clever. So the thing that I really kind of liked about Lightwave, and the reason I chose to
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.960]   select this product and give it a try, was that, you know, there was some science behind it,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.880]   and I'm very interested in that type of science. I'm a biohacker, and this kind of thing appeals
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.360]   to me. And even more so, I kind of wanted to show you the website here, where basically this is our
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.680]   website. They have a flagship product called X39. And if you click on the shop button here,
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.560]   you'll kind of see all the different products that they offer in terms of different patches
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.040]   that they've got that do different things. And so again, their flagship is called X39,
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.400]   and it's to help your stem cells. That particular patch is to help you heal, you know, chronic
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.160]   conditions, because that's what stem cells will do, right, that will replace. So it creates your,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.920]   you know, it creates a frequency in your body to stimulate your own body now to produce more
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.360]   stem cells. So these patches don't actually do anything they actually, you know, to you, they
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.600]   actually help your body do, you know, help itself kind of thing. And so basically, though, you know,
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.320]   when I was kind of looking at, okay, what use case am I most, you know, focused on right now,
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.080]   and that's getting a better night's sleep. So I chose the Silent Night's product, and that's what
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.920]   I'm reviewing, and that's what I've reviewed. So basically, the product costs 79.95 for 30 patches,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.880]   and it comes in a little envelope like this. And so when you sign up for it, basically, it
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.600]   automatically puts you into a subscription. And so I had, you know, once I tried the first batch,
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.840]   you know, I did cancel my subscription, it was very easy to cancel, you know, they don't try to hide,
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.840]   you know, hide the button or anything. And you know, and the description pretty much for Silent
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.840]   Night's was basically this was Silent Night, Silent Night, sorry, elevates melatonin naturally,
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.560]   so your body can peacefully dive deeply into the various restorative levels of sleep and
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.440]   awake and feeling refreshed. Okay, so that's the idea here. This patch, the frequencies of these
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.400]   crystals when interacting with your own bio photon energy, produce helps your body produce more
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.320]   melatonin, and that's kind of the basis of this. So, you know, I thought I'd give it a try. One of
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.160]   the other things that I really want to state and stipulate about LiveWave, I am very impressed with
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.480]   them. All of their technology is patented. There's a patent right here. There's actually multiple
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.920]   patents. This is just on the basic technology of the patch idea, and then they have specific
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.000]   patents for specific patches. So this is the one specifically the biomolecular wearable apparatus,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.480]   and that's what this patent is for is for the concept of patches itself. Again, this is one of
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.360]   many patents you can find on their website, and specific to the actual sleep patch or the slight
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.040]   on the night's patch, they have two studies on their website where they actually had them tested
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.720]   by a company called Shealy Wellness Center in Missouri. And so just to kind of give you a quick
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.600]   overview of what the study was about, essentially it was a sleep study with 25 individuals suffering
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.600]   from insomnia that were entered into the study, and they basically were given the sleep night's
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.120]   patches that you can buy on the website. And they were told to place one of the patches on one
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.120]   of specific acupuncture points at bedtime. So it's really kind of important because there's
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.600]   multiple radiant acupuncture points, right? And so you kind of need to know for what point on your
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.640]   body does, does which patch go on. So it's really important to kind of read the studies to figure
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.400]   out what works best. The studies will tell you what works best. The webpage itself wasn't very
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.720]   informative. Just tell you that. But if you read the studies, it's very informative. So you pick
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:57.040]   one of these three, I actually picked the right right here, the temple. So I basically was, I'm not
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.960]   sure I'm sorry. So anyway, I picked my right temple and my third eye point to actually place the
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.880]   patch for myself. And then so that's what the 25 individuals in the study did. They put a patch
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.160]   on one of those five points. At the end of the day, they measured the individuals using multiple
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.840]   different measurement processes. And basically, they look at the Zung score, the total life symptoms
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.800]   process. You know, there's just different methodologies, ESS test, daytime sleepiness. You
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.200]   know, say I had measured them all sorts of different ways. And it was either useful or not useful in
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.400]   the study. So in the ESS test, they discovered that 72% had normal daytime sleepiness. So it
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.760]   really didn't affect the daytime sleepiness of, you know, the majority of the people. However,
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:46.080]   80% had good quality of sleep through the LSEQ test, and that 88% had improved the length of
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:52.000]   sleep using a test called PSQT. So that was kind of really interesting. So 80% had good quality. And
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.320]   even more important to me specifically is that 88 had improved length of sleep, which is my
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:04.000]   challenge is that I don't get the sleep very long. And then 72% had improved length of sleep on the
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.560]   analog scale. So they use different ways to measure the results, which I like, because there's five
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.360]   different ways to measure the results. And most of the testing that they did actually show it in
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.920]   overall summary here is that light waves, silent nights improve quality sleep, length of sleep,
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:25.440]   and they decrease daytime sleepiness in 72% or more of these 25 individuals. So that's the study. So
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.840]   after reading the study, taking a look at the patent, not a lot of information on the webpage,
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.680]   I decided to go ahead and give this thing a try. And so that's kind of what the basis of my
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.240]   decision was. The last thing I want to, I want to kind of comment on is that, you know, the founder
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:44.080]   that created all of this, and you'll see his name in the patent right here, basically David Schmidt,
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.400]   he's the one that created this and started the company, you know, and basically everything I found
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.800]   out about him, you know, it sounds very reputable. And then in terms of like the community, it's
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:58.320]   very active. There's lots and lots on YouTube about the, you know, about the light wave patches in
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.920]   general. And I think it's tied to the fact that the company has decided to market their product
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.560]   through distributors that they call brand partners. And so it's kind of like an MLL thing, but more
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.480]   so partnership thing, where people like normally, you know, what I've seen so far as doctors,
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.480]   clinicians, healers, practitioners, you know, all these different individuals,
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.480]   and, you know, healing health influencers and so forth, are actually the ones that are signing
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:28.800]   up as brand partners and, and, and marketing this. I actually was in contact with one of those
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.440]   brand partners is how I found out about lightweight. So now for my personal experience, I basically
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.920]   ordered the product and I got the little envelopes got 30 little patches. This is what they look like.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.360]   And I got the little brochure that comes with it. And that's really what the company all they
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.760]   sell you is this little just that's it. And the brochure just says put it on for 12 hours,
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.080]   C page seven where to play it. So we're, you know, so C page seven. So what this is again,
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.760]   right here is based on the information booklet guide that came with the patches. I placed it
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.480]   right here on my right temple. And then I alternated with my third eye spot on the forehead. So this
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.040]   is kind of what I did following the instructions given to me that came with the product. And so
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:11.600]   overall my experience was with these patches is the patch placement was okay. It, it, you know,
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:17.200]   the patches fit where they're supposed to go. They stick on until you peel them off. And then,
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.760]   but the thing that was a challenge for me was remembering to put these patches on. It's just
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.240]   not something that, you know, you do every night is put a sticker on your head. And so, you know,
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.000]   and so I got admit it was kind of, I had to set a timer to remind myself to put these things on
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.760]   or I would have to completely forget. In fact, I did this over a three week time and there were
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.360]   two nights I completely forgot to do it. So it was really hard to build that memory of,
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.040]   you know, just putting these things on. So that was, you know, one of the experiences that I had
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.800]   doing this. The other thing was the timing. The timing, there's no guidance at all that says
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.640]   when you're supposed to put this thing on. It's other than it says put it on at bedtime,
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.560]   wear it for 12 hours. And so, but the whole problem is I go to bed at different times of the day.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:02.720]   But the key thing for me though is I only sleep five hours a night. And I'm kind of what they
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.600]   were referred to as bi-phasic. I sleep twice a day. It's that whole siesta culture thing where,
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.120]   you know, you sleep a little bit at night and you sleep a little bit in the daytime and together
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:16.160]   that's your quote, you know, sleep quota for the day. So bi-phasic individuals will sleep twice a
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.840]   day. So I sleep five hours. And that is ingrained in my head. I have been doing that for decades
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:27.680]   and I wish my biggest goal in life is just I wish I could sleep average seven hours a night
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.520]   because then I wouldn't need and I wouldn't be tired during the day. And so that's kind of what
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.720]   I was trying to address in terms of, you know, buying this product. So the timing of it was
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:42.880]   how that came into play was at first I just did it at bedtime and for the first week and then I
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:47.760]   didn't get any really results from it. So then I started putting it on two hours early. And then
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.280]   here's the thing though, right? If you put it on either two hours earlier or at bedtime, if you
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.760]   only sleep five hours or let's say you only sleep seven hours, you know, and to wear this thing for
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.600]   12 hours means when you wake up, you're going to wear this thing for like five more hours and it
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.480]   didn't make any sense to me because if the thing is supposed to be, you know, basically helping your
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.880]   body create melatonin, you don't want to be creating melatonin in the morning, you want to be waking
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.480]   up. So you want to stop producing melatonin in the mornings. So it didn't make a lot of sense to me.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:19.040]   And that's kind of one of those issues with this product that I had was if I were to wear it for
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:25.200]   12 hours, wouldn't I be putting this thing on five hours before bed and then taking it off when I
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.720]   wake up? You know, so it was kind of that weird and there's lack of guidance there. And that's
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.640]   just what I wanted to share with you. The other thing was, you know, and that was the whole duration
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.840]   thing, the 12 hours. And again, the comfort. Now, one of the things about me is I'm very sensitive
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:43.440]   to anything placed on my skin. And I can't really even wear band aids. And so I was very
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.160]   surprised that these stickers had no effect on me at all. I mean, they didn't cause any rashes
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.480]   or anything like that. So I found them to be very hyperallatogenic in terms of, you know,
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:57.120]   causing any rashes, because you are putting a sticker on your head or on your body every single
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.960]   night while you're, you know, while you're doing this. And so the comfort level was pretty good.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.160]   You know, I had no issues with comfort. I had no issues with patch placement. But just I was,
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.320]   there's a lot of, you know, I had did kind of struggle with timing and duration. And that was
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.040]   kind of what I went through. So now obviously I had a 30 day supply that I could have gone
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.680]   four weeks with, but I actually only did the study for, you know, my personal experiment for,
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:25.040]   for three weeks. And so here's, here's my graph of the number of hours I slept per night for the
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.640]   three weeks, minus the two nights that I forgot to put it on. And the overall average is 5.26.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.800]   So statistically nothing changed over the time period. And you could see where, you know, there
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.600]   are nights where I sleep, you know, five hours is my average. Sometimes every, on a rare occasion,
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:45.280]   I'll get seven hours. Sometimes on a rare occasion, I will get less. Or actually more often than not,
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.640]   I'll get less hours of sleep at night. I just wake up. But the overall issue though was over
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:56.560]   the 19 days or a three week trial. That was basically the average was 5.26. So at the end of this
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:03.760]   experiment, you know, I didn't see any, any results for me. And so that's, you know, that's just my,
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.720]   my review is that I did not find any results. And I don't feel this really would work well for me
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.920]   in terms of what I'm trying to accomplish. So overall, my new thing is the product reviews
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.240]   tinkle meter. And so I kind of just have, you know, in terms of how I admit my expectations,
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:23.120]   it was really low. I did not meet my expectations, but not very low. And I want to kind of distinguish
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:28.560]   what the difference is, is that I know that, okay, when I read the study, you know, those folks that
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:35.920]   got 80%, 88%, right, they did it for 25 days. I only did it for 19. Okay, so obviously, you know,
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.480]   I didn't do it the full length of time. I did kind of move the patch around different to
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.880]   two different spots. Maybe I could have tried different spots. And then when I actually reached
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.760]   out to the company rep that I was working with, they're talking to, she indicated that, you know,
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.560]   there's a lot of different causations for sleeplessness, and maybe, you know, choosing a patch that
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.200]   produces melatonin or helps your body produce melatonin is not the best direction to have taken.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.440]   And then, you know, really to kind of do a lot more analysis as to what's actually causing
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.960]   my biphasic reaction. And to me, it's like, well, it's not stress because, you know, it's been that
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.680]   way for 20 years. And in 20 years, you know, you know, so anyway, so the whole idea was like,
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.800]   there needed to be a lot more analysis to it. And then, of course, she also recommended two
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.040]   other products that I could try to kind of address my sleep issue. And again, she recommended the
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.520]   X 39, you know, saying that, you know, everybody who takes her, you know, that was kind of the quote
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:32.400]   was most people, I guess, would be a better phrasing of people who take the X 39 patch,
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.600]   have really good sleep. And maybe that might be the solution to my problem. So that's kind of
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:43.360]   that, you know, but this is a product review of silent nights. And silent nights in my experience
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:47.760]   did not meet my satisfaction, my expectations in terms of helping me even, you know, even a little
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:53.120]   bit over the course of time that I did try it. And lastly, I just want to let you know why I
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:58.800]   stopped at 19 days. Basically, honestly, I just got tired of putting those things on my head.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.000]   You know, I just, you know, I'll just be honest with you. I didn't like, I don't like putting
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.760]   stuff on my body. And so this is just a modality that didn't work for me.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:10.960]   Because I just don't like it. I just don't like the whole thing about putting stickers on
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.280]   myself. So that's really it. I mean, it's kind of personal, right? But now in terms of, I just
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:21.280]   want to stipulate as well, I mean, I have a red light lamp, I've got a big one. And I don't mind
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.200]   it all standing in front of it for 10 minutes, like, you know, like a hot dog or something, you
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.720]   know, just flipping back and forth. And so, you know, because it's only 20 minutes of my life,
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.640]   and I don't have to, you know, it's just, it's just easier ways of doing different things,
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.040]   right? Or the, or actually different ways of doing the same thing, in terms of trying to get
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.360]   biophoton modulation treatment. So, so that's kind of it for me. So bottom line at the end of the day,
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:47.200]   my review of Silent Night's from Lightwave was pretty much it did not meet my expectations.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.480]   And whether or not I'll possibly try X 39, I'm not sure. As you know, as I mentioned,
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:59.760]   Silent Night sells for $79.95. The X 39 patches for a month is about $149, I believe.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.280]   So it is a lot more pricier. So, you know, whether or not I'm going to try it, I'm,
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.680]   I'm still on the fence. But anyway, that's my review. Thank you for your time this morning,
