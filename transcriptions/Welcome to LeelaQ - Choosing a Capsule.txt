[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kaelmar and this video is a further installment in the video series
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.200]   Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech or Quantum Upgrade.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.200]   This video series is where I take frequently asked questions in any one of the telegram chat groups and answer them in a video format
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.800]   Because sometimes it's a lot easier to show you the answer than it is to try to type it out in a chat group
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.000]   This particular video is all about how to choose a capsule
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.840]   It's a frequently asked questions because you know basically people you know
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.180]   If you're interested in getting a capsule and you go to this page right here on all the different choices
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.680]   It's no, you know
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.840]   It's no it's no coincidence that you see all these different choices and you're kind of wondering, you know
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.480]   Like what's the difference and you know what which one should I get and so let me try to help you make that decision here today
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.880]   In this video now the very first thing to understand is there are six basic different capsules as of January 2025
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.560]   Layla is very innovative and they always are coming out with new products
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.980]   But as of now in January of 2025 there are six
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:10.680]   different capsules and so let me walk you through the six different ones and sort of what's the differences between them first thing is first is that
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.680]   They do come in two different sizes
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.640]   Now most of them are just one size, but there's this one heel 360
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:24.600]   Capsule that has that comes in two different sizes a regular and a petite and then some capsules have frequencies some don't and so that's kind of really
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.080]   The big difference between the capsules is size and what frequencies they hold now the six different capsules are the heel capsule
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.080]   And the thing that I want to kind of point out the first thing you should be aware of is that the word that the acronym
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.960]   Heal is not does not mean the word heal. It's an acronym that stands for holistic experience
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.480]   Abundance and love and so there's you know, there's a lot of confusion that you know that these are like, you know
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.560]   Specifically for healing, but it's actually in an acronym that stands for something that doesn't mean healing
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.640]   It just means an holistic experience abundance and love and that's really an important aspect because you know, these things have different
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.960]   Attributes and and so that's kind of where that falls into play is that the attributes don't necessarily line up with the acronym sometimes
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.560]   Okay, so just keep that in mind, but the very first capsule that is their flagship
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.400]   Product that they first came out with which is the regular HEL heel capsule
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.240]   Now right now, it only comes in a petite size
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:30.760]   And really what the frequencies that are in that capsule is a frequency called primal human healing primal water and nutritional
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.640]   Biobase, okay, and really what that frequency is all about is is to maintain your health. It's really great
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.360]   It's got the it's got all the different nutrients that your body requires in a from you know from a frequency standpoint
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.880]   It's got, you know, primal water, which is like, you know, waters the basis of all life
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.540]   And so it's got pristine frequencies from pristine waters and then of course the primal human healing frequency now that
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.280]   Frequency is sort of the frequency of creation of you know, biologic creation
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.520]   And so it's that spark of life and then that that energy that frequency from that you know from that specific frequency that over the benefit
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.600]   You get from that frequency it promotes health, okay, and so it's a really good, you know, frequency for health
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.000]   And to maintain your health. Now the next one that they came out with which is a frequency called heel 360
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.020]   Is a combination of numerous different molecular frequencies that are geared towards healing and so that's kind of where it
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.800]   It really kind of gets very confusing, you know
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.600]   Where you've got heel with the primal human healing frequency
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.080]   Then you got the heel 360 but if you look at both of them and you kind of just look at it from the 10,000 foot level
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.480]   The regular heel is really meant for maintaining health and heel 360 is really meant for healing
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:54.520]   So if you have issues, you know, illnesses and and chronic issues and whatever and injuries the heel 360 is perfect for that
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.520]   Now the other two that are on available for sale are the men's and women's boosters
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.480]   Now these are two frequencies that I actually created a long time ago
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.320]   and so what I did well for these two particular frequencies is I designed something I
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.080]   Started with for men, you know, because I just wanted it for myself
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.720]   And so when I kind of evaluated like, you know in our later years of our life, you know, middle-agent beyond, you know
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.160]   What are the primary concerns or issues that we have and really it's to it's you know
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.760]   It's that with the loss of our homeward, you know, our hormone levels deep, you know
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.720]   Go down or they get messed up and and that's what, you know, you know older people, you know, middle-agent older
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.080]   Struggle with it's just hormones, you know, and then of course the brain
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.760]   Performance cognitive performance, you know, that seems to be waning in our older years our immune systems need help, you know
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.520]   Dealing with stress and also the whole anti-aging aspect because you know, that's becomes a really
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.120]   Critical aspect of our health because as we get older's are, you know, our bodies start to produce certain things that we need
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.720]   That we used to produce in our youth that we just don't do that anymore our bodies don't function that way
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.120]   So now all of these are frequencies that bring those frequencies back into your body
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.800]   So with the men's booster, you know, there's a there's a component for male hormone
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.840]   You know, of course the brain immune stress and anti-aging and then I switched it up for the women's booster or where I put it in the female hormone
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.120]   So if you're middle-aged and older and you just need to kind of pick me up or you just want to frequency
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.240]   That's going to really kind of help you deal with the, you know
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.640]   The fun part of aging then if you're a man or a woman, these are the two
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:39.880]   Capsules that would be great for that purpose and we've gotten great testimonies in our chat group over the years about people who've purchased this and use these frequencies
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.160]   So that's really, you know, that's really kind of geared towards the middle-aged group
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.800]   Now the three-in-one Olympic capsule
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:53.400]   Has two different frequencies, but it's a little special and I'll get more detail about the special aspect of this
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:00.600]   Particular capsule, but it comes with two different frequencies and one is the Olympic and that's really designed for a physical performance
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.320]   So if you've got anything that you you do that's exerting, you know, your energy
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.420]   Like, you know, let's say, you know, playing pickleball or running or whatever it might be
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.520]   Where you're just exerting yourself and this could be, you know, your work your actual profession is exerting
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.840]   Olympic frequency is awesome for helping boost your physical, you know, performance and you're being able just like the
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.080]   The brain frequency and the boosters helps you think better your cognitive skills are better
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.320]   The Olympic frequency does that for your physical body, okay?
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.680]   And then there's a frequency of happiness and that's exactly what it means and that those two frequencies come with the three-in-one Olympic
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.080]   Now it says three-in-one, so what's that third one?
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.360]   Well, the third one is just pure natural quantum energy, which as you may have understood up to this point
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.800]   Which is what brought you to Leila, which is what quantum energy is is essentially etheric energy
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.680]   It's also known as life force energy and Chi and Prana, but that's, you know
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.880]   It's just the word that they use to kind of describe this energy that exists throughout reality
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.960]   And then the last booster or the last capsule is called the infinity block booster
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:12.000]   And that's a very very special capsule only for people who bought an infinity block before
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.240]   2024 and they want to boost up the energy of those
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.280]   So I would just if you're new to Leila and you don't own of this old, you know an older infinity block
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.320]   Just ignore that one. That's totally does not apply to you
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:27.880]   But that was just a very special one-time product that was meant to help folks, you know
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:33.960]   To help people who wanted to booster infinity blocks to a much higher level than what they purchased them at
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.560]   In one easy swoop, okay
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.160]   So now in terms of the different sizes and this is you know
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.800]   Kind of why they started introducing the petite version a couple of years ago was you know
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   The regular one is like about is 1.85 inches. That's like a 1.9 almost 2 inches tall and it's and it's kind of got some weight to it
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.360]   Right when you put the spheres in it and then the petite one is one and a half inches
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:03.800]   And that's really kind of why the petite one sort of appeals towards you know for people who I guess more so like the women
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.000]   We're asking for it. You know our lady customers
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.760]   We're asking for something that wasn't so masculine and so large and heavy and so they came out with a petite cap
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.800]   So that's just a little smaller and it's a little bit more demir
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.560]   Okay, and that's really kind of why that that you know that there's even two sizes
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.480]   But you know it really gave people options and a lot of people are buying them
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.920]   So it seems to be you know really spot on for what the market was asking for now for those of you who go with
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:33.600]   The metric system, you know, it's it's basically, you know all these things are really kind of like, you know
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:39.080]   Based on metrics, so you know it really kind of measures out where these are the different dimensions of the different
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.400]   You know capsules if you're really interested in like exactly how high it is and and that sort of thing
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.200]   So if you want to do a better understanding of these specific sizes that here's here's the sizes in in the metric system
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.240]   But basically just keep in mind that you know the petite one is about a half inch smaller
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:00.800]   Than than the regular one and it's a little bit narrower, but it does still fit the same size spheres now in terms of features
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.920]   Now this is where it kind of does get really kind of complicated the features for these capsules and basically
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:15.120]   Involve, you know, it looks simple, but it does require explanation all of the capsules except for the infinity
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.960]   Come with spheres now the brass capsule. This is made of brass. The spheres are made out of aluminum
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.160]   I'm sorry the spheres are made out of medical grade titanium
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:32.540]   Okay, so the the capsule is brass the spheres are titanium and in the brass capsule itself is where the frequencies lives
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.120]   Okay, so basically what Leila Q does is they charge they charge these
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:44.840]   Brass capsules up, you know when they're empty and then they impart frequencies on to it like they imprint the frequencies into the brass capsule
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.880]   So the capsule holds the frequency for all of the above except the Olympic
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:56.840]   Okay, so when I talked about the three and one the Olympic is what's different than the other ones because the Olympic capsule has no frequency
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.360]   It just has energy, but all of the other
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:04.040]   You know capsules that that they sell have the frequency mentioned
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:12.080]   In the capsule itself, and that's where the frequencies live now in the terms of the titanium spheres
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:18.320]   Now the regular size capsules have five spheres and the petite one have three spheres
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:24.960]   Okay, and they're all going to be neutral energy if they're purple and so the thing about the spheres is you know again
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.200]   Is that you know the petite only has three the regular one has five and they all have I mean
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.240]   They all come with spheres except the infinity block booster
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.160]   So for those of you who have an older infinity block and you want to boost it up to a higher energy level
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.600]   Then you would buy this this capsule. It's an empty capsule and put that in your infinity block for anything
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.720]   I think it was like 20 minutes, and it'll boost up your infinity block
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.160]   But again, you know for those of you who are new to Leila Q
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:57.760]   Don't worry about that, but I just want to point out that the infinity block booster capsule does not have spheres
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.800]   Okay, but the key thing about the spheres is that they act as a volume knob
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:09.200]   And what I mean by that you can crank up or down the amount of energy by the number of spheres you put in the capsule
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.560]   And and that's kind of really really important when you understand how a capsule works
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.280]   And so right off the bat now the empty capsule is
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.080]   Charged with quantum energy with pure quantum energy
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.880]   It's just neutral life force energy, right?
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:30.760]   And so the amount of energy that a capsule holds is roughly the same as the amount of energy that a card and one of those
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:37.440]   Cards that Leila also sells and so when you take a look at just like okay, if it's an empty capsule like how much energy is it?
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.480]   Well, it's roughly the same as a card, which means that it's really just empty
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:49.440]   It's gonna have a four inch radius. Okay, so that radius means that it's gonna emanate energy and the field for that little capsule
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.680]   It's gonna go out about four inches in every direction
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.240]   And so just like with a card if you have an empty capsule, you have to put it on on your body
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:02.120]   It's got to be like on your body for you to basically experience that energy or and or the frequency of you got a card
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.280]   Okay, but where the power lives is in the spheres
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.320]   The spheres are charged with quantum energy
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:15.120]   They are made out of titanium and not brass and because of the concept of the more dense the material the more energy can hold
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:21.520]   These are what are really like the little batteries that you would put inside your capsule to basically start
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:27.600]   In creating you know creating a stronger and stronger field because you've got more and more energy inside the capsule
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.560]   So when you add all five of your spheres your purple spheres to your capsule
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.520]   You put enough energy inside the capsule where the energy is, you know
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:42.520]   Basically concentrated and now it's emanating just think of it like you know like a light bulb, right?
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.720]   So it emanates like light wood in all directions
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:53.400]   360 degrees in every direction, but when with all five spheres the energy is going to go out six feet in every direction
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.400]   So it's going to be like, you know, it's a basically a 12 foot diameter
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.040]   Bubble of energy and then it you know from the center which would be the capsule
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.720]   It goes out six feet in all different directions
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:11.680]   And that's going to be the most powerful that the capsule is and so what we try to recommend or what the recommendation is
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.400]   It's like when you first get one of these things just try it empty, you know where it empties
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:22.520]   See how you feel put one sphere in see how that feels now a lot of people just like to dive into the deep end of the pool and
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.840]   Put all five spheres in and go for it. That's perfectly fine
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.440]   But just be aware that if you're brand new to quantum energy, you know
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:35.880]   There are people that report that they have some kind of like a detox effect now if you look at the studies about what quantum energy does
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:44.120]   That on a biological level. There are actual distinct biological effects from the energy and it's been well documented in the studies
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:49.840]   So, you know because of what it can do you to you physically and it's all beneficial and positive
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:57.880]   But sometimes it'll kick off some detox effects as you get used to the energy and then also the frequencies also can kind of you know
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:05.240]   Throw things off a little bit until you get used to it and you start to entrain with the energy and if you're using frequencies as well
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.160]   So but that's the general thing on how it works is it's powered by the
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.320]   Spheres and you add them in one at a time or you know go for it
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.080]   But that's going to be what turns up and turns down the the energy
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.720]   For a capsule and then that's what will actually you know
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:27.000]   Start with a four inch radius field and grow all the way to a six foot radius field because it just got more and more powerful as you
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.680]   Added the spheres in so keep that in mind in how it works now in terms of like the frequency in the capsule
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.880]   Versus frequencies in the spheres. Well the one thing again
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:41.520]   I want to state is that the purple spheres that you get with these capsules all of them are just they don't have any frequency in them
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:49.320]   They're just little powerful little you know spheres of energy that you use to power your capsule and they're just neutral quantum energy
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:54.520]   There's no frequency. However, the olympic three-in-one capsule, which is pictured here in the middle
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:15:01.960]   That one has the five neutral spheres so you could just wear it as a completely neutral capsule that just has energy
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:07.320]   No frequencies or you can replace one of these purple ones with a gold or a silver one
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:14.800]   So the gold sphere in the three-in-one Olympic has the Olympic frequency and the silver one has the happiness frequency
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.360]   So for using this one, you have some options, right?
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.760]   You could wear it in three different ways you could wear it as a purely natural neutral energy quantum
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:28.640]   You know pendant or you could wear it with you can just put one of these colored spheres in there
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.840]   the gold or the silver and then you would then now have the
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:39.080]   Edition of the energy you would have the frequency of olympic if you use the gold one or you'd have the additional frequency of silver
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.240]   With the silver sphere and then you would have the happiness
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.320]   So you could wear it as a happiness capsule
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:49.120]   You could wear it as an olympic capsule or you'd wear it as a neutral quantum energy capsule
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.200]   Now these other ones if you just put any of the purple spheres in it's gonna
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.480]   The capsule will be whatever is embedded in the actual shell of the capsule
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:03.560]   So that's where we go back to which frequencies are in which ones and so if you put the spheres at any one of these first four
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:08.920]   Then these are the frequencies that you're gonna be experiencing when you put those spheres in, okay now
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.360]   Just to kind of just answer the general question like okay
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.120]   Well now that describes all the different things about a capsule and the different choices
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:22.200]   But you know like what's what's best for me and the easiest way that I can kind of put this concisely is that if I looked at
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.920]   What the primary use cases are and I've been around since the beginning
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.560]   And I think that you know if I were to kind of summarize like how would you choose the best capsule for you?
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:37.440]   Well, it depends on what your objective is what your desired objective what brought you to Leila quantum tech
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.800]   And so the very first thing though
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.520]   I want to just stipulate that all of the capsules emit pure quantum energy
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:50.000]   And that's what drives that whole thing that you've probably heard about which is the EMF mitigation of quantum energy
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.800]   Which has been documented in the studies and so the studies have shown that these quantum this quantum energy when embedded in objects
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.400]   And you're within the field of that object then you're going to have this incredibly beneficial effect on your body
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.520]   That helps your body mitigate the effect of EMF
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.600]   It doesn't do anything to the radiation itself
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:14.560]   But what it does is it changes you on the inside and how your body is reacting to the damage from that radiation
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:23.040]   So now again all of the other capsules no matter which one you you get is going to have that EMF mitigation quantum energy aspect
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.560]   So that's right off the bat, but if you want more than that
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.200]   Then here's the the where I kind of boil down what the desired objectives are
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.760]   So again if you're if you're just really into something like hey
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.760]   I want something that's going to promote health and it's going to help me feel better and it's going to help me
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:43.200]   Perform better and that sort of thing then you want to take a look at whether you want to get the regular heal capsule
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.000]   The men's capsule or the woman's capsule. So I'll write off the bat. They're all great
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.840]   It's just really specific like if you're a middle age and you're a man and you're wanting to get that little extra boost in your life
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.240]   Then men's is great again same thing for women
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.320]   And now if you just want overall health and you just want to feel better and you want something
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.000]   That's going to help you kind of just deal with the EMF and also help
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.560]   You know kind of help your body along from a maintain your health perspective then the heal of capsule is really great for that
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.200]   Now the other one here again as I mentioned earlier
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.280]   Now if your desired objective is healing like you know you have chronic issues you have
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.560]   You're you're overcoming an injury then the heal 360 capsule is ideal for that again
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.080]   It's like literally was meant to help people with
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:33.280]   Problems that they're trying to heal. Okay, so that's really where that one frequency comes into and it's a great capsule for healing
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.600]   Now the next one here is again. I mentioned
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.680]   Perphysical performance. You definitely want to try the olympic capsule
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.960]   And that frequency is awesome for any one of those types of
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.440]   activities that you do that you exert yourself and then the here thing the thing about
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:54.960]   Customization is the one of the coolest parts about a capsule is you can customize and make your own
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:00.160]   Frequencies and make it whatever you want. So if you're someone who really understands
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.960]   uh, you know frequency quote medicine
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.840]   And you want to you know, maybe utilize some of your homeopathic remedies
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.280]   You want to utilize some of your essential oils or even if you're into
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:18.640]   Reeky and crystals and stones and you understand the dynamics of the frequencies that are emitted by some of these natural things from mother earth
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.800]   Then you can actually capture those frequencies and you could do this with pharmaceuticals
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.320]   You could do this with supplements
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.000]   You could do this with anything that you can kind of fit under a little packet of spheres
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.160]   And so if you want to customize your own and do whatever you want first things first
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.240]   You can customize any capsule. Okay, right off the bat
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.960]   However, if you take any one of the first four
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.200]   And you try to customize these guys, which is perfectly fine and it works great
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.480]   The challenge you're going to have is you're going to be customizing
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.600]   Um, you're going to add a frequency to what's already there
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.960]   You see what i'm saying because that the capsule already has a frequency and you want to customize it by adding another one
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.800]   That's perfectly fine and so you can kind of get the best of both worlds
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.600]   So you could get you could get any of those and you could customize those
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.320]   However, if you want a capsule, that's only the thing you want only the frequency you want
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:13.440]   Let's say you really are adamant about here. I want to I want to get a capsule where I could carry around their frequency of
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.320]   Whatever, you know, just pick something like it could be any uh essential oil. It could be a crystal
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:24.080]   Whatever then you would want to get the olympic because the olympics neutral has no other frequencies in the capsule
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.240]   The shell right and then you would add that frequency to that capsule
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.640]   And i'll show you that in a second and then you could then customize it to be specifically
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.760]   What you want not a combination with the other frequencies and so that's kind of semantics there
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.880]   But it really is kind of important for people that just want to have a pure
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.240]   Experience with just you know a purpose built
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:50.160]   Customize capsule just for you then you would want to get the olympic one because the olympic one has a neutral shell
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.800]   And you can make it whatever you want with no other
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:57.440]   Frequencies involved and then the lastly, you know as if you want to upgrade your older infinity blocks
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:02.720]   Obviously, you'd want to get the infinity block booster now lastly about customizing and I don't want to mention this
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.200]   On how you do it, uh, you know, that's a tutorial
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.160]   So if you want to go ahead and i'll put the link in the video description below
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.120]   But the how to use the layla super capsule
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.080]   Because that's what the olympic was called in the beginning
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.760]   And so but they changed the name to olympic, but it was originally called super
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.880]   And so now there's i made a tutorial on how to actually use the spheres
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.040]   To then copy the whatever frequency you want onto a piece of foil
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:32.160]   You curl up that little piece of foil and you stick it inside your capsule put the spheres in and boom
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.320]   You've got a customized capsule. It's really that simple and this little short
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:42.240]   Tutorial will show you how to customize your capsule and again you can customize any of the capsules
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.560]   It's just a matter of do you want to add a frequency to an existing frequency set
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:51.760]   Or you want to have a pure just by itself frequency and that's going to be the difference in the choices there
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.880]   So really, you know
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.680]   If you're looking at getting a capsule for any of these reasons
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:01.600]   Then these are the ones you're going to probably want to take a look at and that's the answer to the the general question on which one do i should i get?
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:08.320]   Okay, well, anyway, I hope this was helpful and educational and and and and you know, thank you for coming to layla q i think it's it's a great
