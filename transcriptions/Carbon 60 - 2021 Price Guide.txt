[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another carbon 60 video. I'm your host K. Elmer and in this video
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.640]   I just want to walk you through the updated carbon 60 market price guide
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.560]   You know, it's something that I started four years ago
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.720]   It's just a list to keep track of who is selling C60 and then what kind of oils and etc
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.640]   And it's kind of just turned into this thing that I do every year where I just walk you through everything
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.280]   That's tied to C60
[00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.440]   And what it's you know, what the prices are for it for those of you who've been hanging out with me for a few years
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.680]   This is the annual update. You know, it got so big. I only do it once a year now
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.200]   For those of you who are new and looking to purchase C60 products, this is the list
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.480]   So let me just jump right in, you know in terms of the list of who sells what and for what? Okay
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.760]   All right, so this is the list and and just for you that haven't seen it before I kind of broke it into
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.920]   You know, the main sellers of the C60 in olive oil and then over here on this side is if they sell
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.940]   C60 in other oils avocado MCT sunflower hemp pumpkin seed oil or miscellaneous
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:19.240]   And then there's the notes that accompany that it is arranged in the lowest to highest price per table spoon
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.440]   Which is the typical?
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.140]   Serving, you know serving slash dosage is a tablespoon, which is 15 milliliters by the way
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.640]   There is no standard for sizes of bottles
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.080]   So you know and but the most standard that I can kind of like you know apples to apples compare things
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.040]   Is either a hundred milliliter bottle or a four ounce bottle?
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.720]   So you'll see prices by size broken out like that
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:54.940]   And then of course you've got your purities of the C60 that they say that they you know are using and what the saturation rates are
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.560]   The industry benchmark is point eight and then it goes up from there
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.280]   And then the idea here on this column right there is just for you market guys that are in the industry
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.320]   I keep tracks of if the variance of the price has gone up or down. All right, so let's just jump in now
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.500]   This is the C60 olive oil sellers. There's other oils as well and I'll walk you through that so you understand how this
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.160]   Spreadsheet works basically here's the list and you know, it's a lot longer than 12
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.160]   It is probably three times that big if you just consider all the products
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.260]   But this year it just got to be unmanageable
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.120]   So what I tried to do and to be the best of my ability was I weed out all of the resellers
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.280]   Okay, so these are a list of people who produce C60 oils and that's what they sell on their websites
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.880]   They don't sell, you know, like, you know, socks and and and herbs and all this other stuff. They just sell C60
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.160]   Primarily, that's their thing, you know, the C60 products
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.720]   So and so these are not resellers. These are actual manufacturers
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.320]   And so here's the list of them again, you know, it is it is arranged by price
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.640]   Per quote serving. That's my definition of serving. It's a tablespoon
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.240]   So you've got lowest to highest and here's all the prices and and this is for olive oil
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.480]   Okay
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.840]   So this whole section here is for olive oil and so, you know, right now you can at that at best, you know
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.600]   You can get at get it C60 in olive oil as low as $3 or serving all the way up to $13 or serving
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.400]   Which is you know over four times that depending on who you buy it from so one of the things that you know, if you're out shopping
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.640]   You're new to C60. Obviously, most people kind of start at the lower end
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.880]   Because they just want to try it
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.320]   But I do want to point out that if you try these higher ends, it's expensive
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.680]   But you might be a little surprised that you know that there's a reason it's a little bit more expensive
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.160]   Because they they do different things and they're mixing processes
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.920]   More than just, you know, put it on a stir for two weeks
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.440]   So there is a reason it is a lot higher
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.960]   You know, in my opinion after researching and reading everybody's website, which I spent the entire day doing
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.320]   Okay, so here's that you know, basically that's it
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.240]   Those are the prices and these are the different other oils that they offer if you see a price here
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.040]   That's the oils now one of the things I do try to break out the price guide in is you know
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.040]   Because I get contacted every now and then people looking to buy C60
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.240]   So that's why you know, I just send them this list
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.680]   But I you know it is broken down as much as possible
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.720]   By different countries and mostly by their currencies
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.440]   So, you know, you've got UK merchants. You got Australian merchants, and you know, I'm English speaking
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.880]   So I am limited to what I can read and then there's merchants in other countries that have an English website
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.280]   And I yes, I know there's Google Web Translate, but you know it takes way too long
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.360]   So here's the list in English and so yeah, here's so this is where you're at in England
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.200]   In I'm sorry UK, and you know, you can get
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.700]   C60 in olive oil as low as 524 pounds up to 9 pounds per serving
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.320]   Australia's an Australian dollars as low as 850 all the way to 1124
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.680]   Depending on the merchant in olive oil in some of these, you know, you know, they've got different different oils
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.600]   And then of course there's merchants in other countries kind of all over
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.160]   That I've been tracking a France Switzerland, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, you know, so forth in Germany
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.800]   And so those are all the different, you know, different down here is all the different sellers in those other countries
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.560]   So, you know, because that's the biggest thing
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.880]   It seems to me that people contact us on the telegram chat group is you know, they're having a hard time
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.720]   Getting anything through customs let alone, you know, something, you know, a liquid in a bottle
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:49.600]   So if you're in a specific country look for C60 sellers in your country, hopefully I've kind of found some of them for you
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.080]   As best as I can and this is the price for olive oil, you know, and then you can go, you know, low to high
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.080]   Now over here is just all over the place
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.840]   You know in Hawaiian we would call that kapakai anyway, it just means scattered. Okay, so then you've got, you know
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.840]   They obviously have different oils
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.960]   Some of them do and you know, and it's just a matter of you know from an oil standpoint
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.000]   I just want to point out that, you know, olive oil is the been proven to be the best oil for
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.560]   Saturation meaning it holds the most amount of C60 in the oil and then there are other oils that
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.340]   Are kind of close like avo is avocado is probably the closest to
[00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.000]   Olive oil the one that's farthest away is actually MCT in terms of saturation
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.280]   How much C60 that oil can hold so, you know, it's kind of really really important that when you're buying C60
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.480]   To realize, you know, and then this this right here means for olive oil not for any of these other oils
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.360]   That you know, if you want to try C60
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.000]   Be aware that you're out to buy C60 and not buy oil
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.720]   So you want to get the most amount of C60 in the product you're purchasing
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.480]   That's where your dollars are going so keep in mind different oils do not hold as much C60 as others
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.360]   All right, so olive oil is the that's why olive oil is the benchmark
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.960]   But you know, there's all sorts of different kinds of oils to you know
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.360]   If you look over here on the side you got people making C60 in black seed oil almond and sesame can meal
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.760]   Kamalina
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.040]   Which by the way, you know, it's kind of interesting for the first couple of years after 2017
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.280]   There was this mad rat, you know, rush in the industry to produce C60 products in other oils
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.880]   So one of the most interesting things that I noted this year after studying websites all day
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:34.160]   Was that there's only been one of all of these guys only one additional oil this year
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.760]   Everyone's kind of sticking to what they created in late 2019 and 2020
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.560]   Actually, I did this last in February 2020
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.200]   So this is as of 2019, you know, these are the oils and it didn't really change
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:52.900]   There's only one company that actually added a new oil that didn't exist on this price guide before and that was this company right here
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:58.360]   That produced it in a Kamalina oil, which I had to look up what the heck that was and it's some kind of flax seed oil
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.160]   Right, and that's just the newest oil that's been added
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.520]   So it really seems like that that rush about you know, hey, let's expand out of olive oil and try different oils
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.480]   You know, it seems like that that that kind of like, you know, trend is gone
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.600]   There hasn't been anyone adding new oils and then the other thing that was really interesting is looking at the variance in pricing
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.200]   There has been no change to consumer prices, which has been that's a really good sign
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.320]   I mean two years ago. We had a shortage. It was a massive spike in price
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.040]   And then the prices I'll show you they'll do an industry walk through here in a second on pricing
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:36.160]   But you know, there's been no relative increase in price over the last year, which is amazing. It's just zero
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.960]   There's just their flat line. They're the same price. They were you know a year ago
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:48.160]   And some a couple in the red have gone down and there's only one product in on my entire list that actually got went up in price
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.260]   And that's these guys here. So congratulations to you
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:57.020]   Okay, but that's pretty much it. So, you know, you're seeing a stabilization in consumer prices
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:03.160]   We're seeing a stabilization in the types of oils. So, you know, that's what we're going that's where we're going from here
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.760]   But if you're new to see 60, you know, this is the list just click you can check any of these vendors out
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.000]   Here's their prices. You want to start out cheap
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.640]   You want to try the expensive ones go from you know, that's how you do it
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.880]   But for you guys that have been in the industry for a while. There you go. That's how you read this thing now
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:22.960]   Let's talk about this specialty stuff now if there's if they're vendors that are not selling oil like I mean
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.960]   Sorry olive oil C 60 olive oil
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.520]   Or they're selling C 60 oil in different types of you know
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:36.680]   Med you know methods like capsules and so so this is where I kind of cover the specialty and three years ago
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.360]   There wasn't even a specialty section. It was like one vendor selling pet
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:47.080]   But now you know, I think that in 2020, which is the I'm reviewing 2020 now
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.360]   It seems like in the year 2020 one of my predictions was that there'd be a you know
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.360]   like a basically an increase in the number of
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.120]   folks selling topicals and that did happen
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:05.800]   But what I didn't predict which was interesting to notice now is that there's been a real big increase in the number of pet products out there
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160]   That or marketing for pets. So here's the list right now
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.920]   And it's almost doubled in terms of the number and you know, it's a small number of vendors
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.640]   But double is still double. So, you know, I'm back in the original days
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:23.160]   You know four years ago live pet was the only vendor out there making a C 60 products for pets
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:30.800]   And it's a specific pet product with specific proprietary blend of oil. It's not just like oh, let's take our olive oil
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.400]   rebranded as you know, you know as pet product and you know, it's the same oil, but it's different label
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:42.120]   And you know, there are a couple of these guys that are doing that. It's their same product for humans with a different oil
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.200]   So there's no difference. It's not specific to pets
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.320]   It's just a different label on the bottle and you know kudos to you for being creative
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.840]   But you know, that doesn't really fly in my book when it comes to hey, you know, when you look up
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.480]   And this is important for your pets guys if you're gonna give your pet something you do some research
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.920]   Is that oil okay for your pet? I'm assuming these guys did that, you know
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.480]   But you want to make sure because you know, my daughter is you
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.080]   I don't know if I've mentioned this, but she's a veterinary student and men
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:16.080]   She's always hammering on me about what I give the dogs. So, you know, you see you really got it
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.840]   You know, some things you think are just intuitive to give your animals
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.400]   You know are not and don't give it to them. It makes them sick or something
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.520]   So, but you know, this is like a C 60 purple power got into it
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:33.160]   Gresca's relabeled their existing product purple power sort of done that did the same. You still have live pet out there
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.980]   Oh, I do want to point out live pet actually came out with a new
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:41.920]   Product for pets called their thrive whole pet formula and they're not it's not just olive oil, you know
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.360]   It's different. It's you know specific to animals
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.000]   And then SES just rebranded their their same product
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.760]   Just you know and call it for pets
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.360]   But I think one of the telomoths right here in Ireland
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:59.060]   They came out with a C 60 mega 3 salmon oil, which is smart because that's really good for dogs, right?
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.160]   So that's that's that sort of thing. Of course the prices don't you know, it's all kapakai
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.640]   And so it's there's no real you know rhyme or reason to the list in terms of top to bottom
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.680]   But you know, these are the pet products out there
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.200]   So, you know, and I also want to encourage everybody man
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.320]   If you haven't given your pets some C 60, especially if you have an older dog give it C 60 there
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:23.280]   It's amazing if you go on the YouTube channel for live pet there is testimony after testimony of pet owners
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.800]   Showing you video of their dogs before and after C 60 and you know, hey, there's no dogs don't have an opinion
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.400]   They're not biased. They're either not walking around and running around as old dogs or they're running around and you know
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.120]   And you see it and see it in horses you see it in cats
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.920]   So that's like to me the proof is on the pudding when it comes to see 60 and I know it works
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.200]   Because like you know, I can see it happening in my dog. So yeah pets
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:52.920]   With C 60 good stuff. Hope you do it. Give it a try. Okay. Now. There's other C 60 blends and this is like all over the map
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.760]   And so I just kind of just here's the price and this is the stuff that they're selling
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:03.680]   You know, everything from you know, they make a proprietary blend this guy makes a special blend
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.160]   Just for men just for women this guy makes a CD CBD, you know
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.800]   C 60 which is outrageously expensive as you can imagine because CBD oil is expensive
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:20.440]   See 60 is expensive put it in a bottle together. You got double expensive, right? You've got, you know, mega oils. You've got
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.120]   You know all the you just got this
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:29.480]   Or this guy's just avocado coconut. They don't make olive oil, you know, and then you've got different mixes
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.960]   You've got you know, they mix C 60 a black seed oil and MCT oil and all that stuff
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:41.560]   So you've got a lot of different mixes in here like here's one in Sunflower oil, but it's different the way that it's approached
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.000]   You got you know, it's the gresca's version there there they don't even think in terms of
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:52.640]   Like tablespoons and teaspoons. They're like one two-thirds of a dropper. They're they're just saying they've got highly, you know
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.280]   It's a highly concentrated C 60 product just, you know two-thirds of a dropper
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.400]   That's all you need and then and their customers swear by it, you know, so so yeah
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   I mean you've got concentrated
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:10.320]   Etc lots of different concepts here in terms of other C 60 blends that are products out there that I don't appear
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.000]   They don't appear appear because they're not in olive oil
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.520]   This is like this is the you know, the to me. This is the foundation of the industry is people selling C 60 in olive oil
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.760]   Why because that's what they did in the botty study, which is the famous rat study
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.680]   Everybody calls you know calls out when you talk about C 60 so these guys are deviated away from that
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:33.360]   Selling C 60 and different kinds of oils and blends of course. I did the pets now
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:39.200]   Let's talk about C 60 and capsules. That was another trend that was real interesting in 2018 2019 where
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.040]   Vendors started putting C 60 and capsules
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.880]   And you know the problem with that is you take you know
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.920]   I mean it takes like five to eight capsules just to get a tablespoon, you know
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.760]   That's a lot of gelatin, you know the stuff that you know
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:58.000]   So anyway, so I'm not a real fan of capsules although except in the case of black seed oil
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.760]   I make my own black seed oil capsules because a it's awesome if you have not made or tried
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.800]   C 60 in black seed oil. I highly recommend it. I make my own and you know
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:16.480]   I'll tell you if it really helps regulate your digestive system. You'll be amazed what happens
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.520]   You know to your to your pipes, but but you know
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:26.080]   So so the and the reason I encapsulate black seed oil because you don't want to put that in your mouth
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:30.280]   You know and and taste it. It's pretty nasty stuff
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:34.400]   So, but you know you've got different players in there. You got the Layla C 60
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.280]   See that's how I got turned on to you know black seed oil
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:43.520]   friend of mine Philip sent me some bottles and I tried it and I was hooked and of course, you know
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.080]   I make my own so you know, thank you for that. That was really cool
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.120]   I wouldn't have known otherwise to try it that way
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:55.840]   But then you've got you know these other different companies live longer labs kind of started the trend and then also at the same time in there in
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:02.680]   isolation, there's this trend that started in 2020 of C 60 oils mixed in with different types of of
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:09.520]   Supplements and you know and then there's actually been patents been filed and actually I even if you can go on the Guller scholar
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.640]   you'll find a studies on C 60 fullerenes and
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:19.200]   Curcumin and the combination is exceptional. So there's some real interesting combinations here
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.840]   So you can get capsulated black seed oil and capsulated black seed oil with curcumin
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:29.560]   Right, you can get, you know, just regular old capsulated C 60 olive oil
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:37.360]   Which is these two guys and then this one here is like the Layla and this is what they do is that they do up encapsulated black seed oil with
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:44.000]   Acystaxin which is a another antioxidant and so some of these combinations are pretty cool. I'm actually tinkering around
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.040]   Trying to make my own, you know, C 60, you know in a
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.160]   C 60 oil with like, you know, you know, N and M and resveratol
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.800]   Just to kind of see what I can make myself like a super anti-aging C 60 oil, you know
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.600]   So you know the whole idea in capisylation and the concept of adding supplements
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.560]   It's kind of like it hasn't really taken off much
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.240]   It's just a few guys kind of tinkering around with that but kudos to you guys
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:14.760]   For even you know going that direction with C 60 in terms of adding supplements to it and additives
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.720]   I think that's pretty cool. I think these guys are really cool, too
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.280]   I mean, you know, it's it's fun to experiment it's fun to tinker
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:25.600]   You never know if the market will will be know will demand it and if you can sell it and people want it
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:31.960]   So and especially, you know, if it's good for you, so keep going you guys are doing great now on the topical front
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.240]   Like as I said, I knew that it was gonna pop out because I had tried some of these products
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.680]   I did a video on it and it was they're awesome
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:44.400]   I mean, I really really like C 60 oil products because you know it because they're it's an antioxidant
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.160]   I mean, that's it's more than that. It's called a radical oxygen species sponge, right?
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.760]   Which means if you put C 60 on your skin
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:59.120]   It's like rubbing antioxidants on top of your skin and it's gonna just wipe out the radical oxygen damage on the surface of your skin
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.120]   And if you're taking it as oil or
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:07.720]   Internally, you're gonna get it from the inside out topical outside in you get this kind of wonderful blend of and I'll tell you
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.520]   You know, you should try it if you got skin issues give it a try
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.440]   You know, and so yeah, definitely there's been twice as many
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:20.920]   There's twice as many people selling topicals now and twice as many products out there for topical
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:27.120]   So it's really cool. There's this long list of you know, whether it's a C 60 anti aging eye cream now
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.920]   You can get a moisturizing lotions facial oils body lotions face cream
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.300]   I mean, there's all these different choices now that we never had before not even a year ago
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:42.000]   So it's really really cool if you want to try a C 60 topical product. Here are the links to these vendors
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.400]   These are the prices the size and what it is and I got to tell you, you know, it's it is really good
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.720]   You'll be amazed. I mean one of my favorites right right now is you know
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:57.200]   I always really like that C 60 labs. They're coconut moisturizing lotion really really really like it
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:03.280]   Right now my favorite that I really like using a lot is the body lotion from Layla Labs
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.040]   It smells awesome. And then this face cream, you know
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.800]   I got a sample of that and then of course my daughter stole it
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   You know, so hey, that's really nice
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.040]   You know kid comes home from college and takes my stuff, but then I asked her about it
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.880]   She's like it's really great. I'm like, okay. We'll give it back and and I never saw it again
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.660]   So, you know, so it's obviously good if people are gonna steal it from you
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.320]   But that's a little labs and of course you've got other vendors and then you know
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.760]   I just want to point out something and I'm not trying to be critical to you guys
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:34.100]   But if you just take your existing product and slap a new label on it and call it. It's topical
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:39.040]   It I'm not even gonna put it on the list. It's your it's your regular ingestion product these guys
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:45.640]   It's a specific blend of all sorts of really cool good for your skin stuff and C 60
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:51.480]   All right, it's not just oh here's our C 60 in olive oil. We'll just slap a label on it and call it
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.360]   Topical no, no, that's not topical. It's your you know, I mean you call it whatever you want
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:59.360]   I don't want to be critical up, but you know, it's not really a quote true
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.160]   Topical like it's designed for skin, right? See what I'm saying? There you go
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.720]   Okay, so now in the raw C 60 world
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:13.080]   You know the same vendors only one fell off it just disappeared off the map
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:19.680]   But here's your your your others right here. It looks like my numbering schemes really messed up. So let me fix that while I'm here. So
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.960]   What's interesting about raw C 60, okay?
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:29.880]   Is that the prices really really dropped? I mean they dropped like twenty thirty dollars per gram
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.000]   For the for the three that you know, the low three
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.600]   With the with the lowest prices the highest price guys, you know, the prices stayed the same
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:44.280]   They did not go up or down. So that was pretty interesting now red line did go up over 2020
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.320]   But then you've got MTR drop to as low as 109 now right now
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:56.520]   If you go on their website for 99.95 one gram C 60 it's 109 that is the lowest on the market right now as of now
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:02.240]   This is February 2021. So that is the best price out there. Of course, you've got Solairs cam
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:10.840]   It's 149 and theirs went down from last year by like 2030 bucks. So yeah, I was pretty amazed that the prices are coming down
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.160]   I would have thought that it would level off
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:17.400]   So, you know that that's a really good thing for the industry and this is only at the one gram mark
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:23.480]   Everybody that makes C 60 all these guys they obviously buy it a lot cheaper because they buy in bulk
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.160]   So good news to any one of the DIY folks that are making it themselves
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.440]   Your raw material prices are going down
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.080]   Take advantage of that and let me tell you why right here. Here's the analytics, okay?
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:40.200]   Now this is something for the industry, you know, as you know, I've been tracking it for four years now
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:46.120]   When we first started out are you not me? I'm not part of your industry. Sorry when you first started out
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.920]   The I was measuring your average price in the US of one ounce of C 60 all of well
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:59.160]   Okay, and it was 1274 back then and it just here's that spike because of that massive shortage because ses decided to stop selling to consumers
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.960]   Thank you
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.120]   And so there was this I mean you got the biggest
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:10.280]   You know seller of C 60 in the country and they decided to stop selling to the DIY guys and they would only sell
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:15.960]   To their favorite, you know their favorite customers and themselves because they wanted to divert it all to making their own product
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:21.960]   Which you know, it's their right to do so, but it really just gave the industry a massive kick to the ganets
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:27.480]   From a price standpoint where there's a massive spike in price, but then you can see where it's leveling down now
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.640]   So it's dropped from 1489 average one ounce C 60 oil
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:39.000]   1448 and now in 21, you know over the last 12 months. It's dropped 1383. That's a four and a half percent decrease
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:47.080]   Year-over-year in the price of C 60 oil retail. Sorry, that's pretty cool. I mean so, you know what that really tells us is there's a real
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:53.560]   Stabilization in the price, which means what if you recall economics one-on-one?
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:59.240]   That means there's a balance between supply and demand and until there's another cliff high moment on sarah westhall
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:06.040]   Right. I mean, could you imagine if if somebody like, you know, dr. Oz or some dr. Phil, whatever these guys are I don't watch tv
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.200]   You know, they go out and they talk about C 60 to the to the you know the mass market
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:15.720]   What would happen next? I'd be another cliff high moment, right? And so and that refers to this event that happened in
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.080]   2017, which is what started this and so
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.800]   You know when that happens, you will see another spike
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:27.720]   But until then there's a nice balance now where there's just enough demand to meet the supply and the prices are stable
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:33.080]   So that's that part. That's the whole you know industry pricing guide now the thing that I want to point out
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.320]   To anybody who has not heard my pitch and I have repeated this pitch
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.520]   I don't know a hundred couple hundred times in every video
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.600]   It's the cost to make your own
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:48.280]   What everything I've just said up to this point for the last 22 minutes is hey, you know, this is about buying it
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.920]   But this is about making it yourself because that is what my entire channel
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:58.600]   The original series that I'm doing I'm doing three different series now, but the first series was on c60
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.800]   I'm still doing c60 videos to write this video
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:07.800]   But make it yourself, you know, because it's such a valuable supplement
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.080]   Make it yourself. Okay diy
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.320]   Because if you make it yourself, you're going to spend about a hundred bucks and stuff
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.560]   You know, and you know, I've got a minute. I just went to amazon and reprised all this stuff
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.680]   This is all you need to make your own. Okay, you need four things
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:28.440]   Cost you a hundred bucks, but you know what the price of that stuff did go up 16 percent year over year
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.280]   I'm a little surprised about that, but the cost of equipment has gone up a little bit
[00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.240]   You know, it's not it's still not a deal breaker
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:40.520]   You spend a hundred bucks on equipment you buy the supplies, which is olive oil and c60
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:48.760]   Now it's I got a 120 250 price in there because I buy through the wholesale discount at label labs for our telegram chat group
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.400]   Uh, and i'm loyal to those guys because they're loyal to us the the group
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:25:00.680]   So, but you know, it's so I pay 120 250 for my grams, but overall it's like 146 50 first for this for the actual
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.600]   Supplies, okay, so you've got equipment and supplies your equipment costs are capital
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:08.680]   You don't you know and just depreciate that off and then what your run rate is on your supplies, right?
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.160]   That's what you're going to burn. I go through a leader a month
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:17.560]   And so this is what i'm spending and it costs me right now as of now and it's gone up like 9
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:24.120]   Year-over-year because the costs have gone up, but i'm still saving 950 so here's the thing
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.840]   my diy price
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:34.600]   Or cost to make c60 oil for myself and my pet my two dogs is four dollars and 33 cents an ounce
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.640]   Okay, it has gone up 9 percent year-over-year
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:42.680]   Which is which is weird because retail hasn't changed but diy has gone up
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:49.080]   But what what does that compare to d to retail if the average price for retail to buy it on?
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:54.840]   Online is 1383 an ounce and you can make it for 433 an ounce
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.800]   And you can save $9.50 per ounce
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.800]   Making it yourself and it only takes these four things
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.520]   And again a few weeks
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.560]   You know what you need to start making yourself. Okay. All right. That's my Dave Ramsey speech
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.320]   All right, I'm sorry, I'm just gonna be you know, hey, it's you know beans and rice save some money
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:19.000]   Okay, so anyway, that's that uh the last thing I want to point out is this little section here
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.120]   Which is i'm a tinker and you know what these guys are tinker's they're making
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.000]   new things
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.160]   That relate to fullerenes their new products that have been released on the market most recently
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:36.120]   Not this one. This one's only for comparison, but I want to point it out because it's really really cool
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:43.160]   You've got this carbon 60 Evo has come out with a c70 product the second one in the industry
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:49.720]   There's only been one person selling c70 in olive oil and now you've got another person out there
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:54.440]   So it's the first time I've ever seen anyone else start selling c70 in oil, right?
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.880]   So that's pretty cool
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.400]   I did, you know, I've done some videos
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:01.960]   By the way, the links in below for the videos of different ways to take c60
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:07.080]   And then a video about threes these three guys specifically in terms of how cool
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:14.520]   You know what they're doing and what their newest fullereno c60 related product is or fulleren related products
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.280]   So check it out the video description below. It's pretty sure like 20 minutes
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:23.320]   But it's really cool to hear about what these three new guys are doing or they're these guys doing new things
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.120]   I'm sorry, but you can inhale c60 now
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:30.840]   Through you know in all i'm sorry oil c60 oil atomizer
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.640]   You can take c70. There's carbon nano onions, fullerenaals, fullerenaals
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:42.760]   And then there's this thing called the biopteran filter. You can take a quantum hyperlight through a c60, you know, I mean it's
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:46.360]   Wicked cool. So, you know from a tinker standpoint
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.080]   So I just want to say there's been some new products released
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.320]   It's cool stuff if you're into c60. Hey, check out the links below. But other than that
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:59.400]   That's it. Thanks for hanging out for 27 minutes. Sorry. It's a little longer than I expected it to be but it's like
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.800]   I'm just rambling
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.960]   But thank you so much. I do appreciate your time
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:09.240]   I hope all of this information was helpful for you and that you know, you're able to save some money somehow and listen to me
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.320]   Make some di you know diy
