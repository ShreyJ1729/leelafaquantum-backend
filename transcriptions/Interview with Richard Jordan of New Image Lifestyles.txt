[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.700]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and today I have got a real treat.
[00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.400]   A good friend of mine who runs New Image Lifestyles,
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.000]   Richard Jordan is joining me for a chat to share with you and me.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.600]   All of his lifestyle, you know, which is really what it is,
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.600]   a New Image Lifestyle.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.200]   He's another individual who, just like myself and in like Philip,
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.400]   if you know Philip from Leila Quantum Tech,
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.000]   where we just basically are executives in companies out there
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.200]   in the world for our day job, and one day we end up, you know,
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.800]   following our true purpose of being a healer or a biohacker
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.800]   or a tinker, and Richard's one of that wonderful group of folks.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.100]   So I'm just really happy to have you on, Richard.
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.600]   Are you today?
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.300]   I'm doing great, Kay, and I thank you for the opportunity to share.
[00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.200]   Yeah, I just definitely want to introduce you to the crowd.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.900]   So let me go ahead and read some disclaimers
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.100]   so we don't get in trouble and then we'll just jump right in.

[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.200]   Hey, so anyway, so here everybody, let me just do a quick introduction
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.400]   and then let Richard kind of fill in the blanks.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.600]   But Richard's basically a very accomplished businessman
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.000]   who's been founding and starting and running company since like 1968.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.200]   And he's got a hell of a pedigree of different things that you've been doing.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.400]   I don't even know if you can kind of like, you know,
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.300]   like elevator speech, you know, everything up until New Image Lifestyles was founded.
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.700]   But in the way I look at it is just a tremendous amount of experiences,
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.700]   you know, being in the world of industry.
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.000]   And then of course, you know, just like myself, you know,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.600]   you leave your career behind and then follow a passion.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   And that's where New Image Lifestyles starts.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.900]   So is that about a good elevator pitch on your background, Richard?
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.500]   You go by Richard, right?
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500]   I go by Rich, yeah.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.900]   I like people to prophesy to me, you know,
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.100]   when they say they want to call me Rich.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.800]   That'd be good.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.100]   OK.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.100]   But that's it.
[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.600]   You've got a pretty good summary right there on your screen.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.700]   You know, I started off in the coatings industry
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.900]   and electrostatic coatings and got into the whole energy conservation movement
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.500]   when we had the oil bar embargo back in the late 70s, early 80s.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.300]   And when you get into energy conservation, you tighten houses up
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.900]   and then we became concerned about the quality of air in homes.
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.900]   And one of the things that we would test for was radon.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.300]   And I ended up developing a radon laboratory to test these things
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.300]   and then that evolved into fixing it.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:19.000]   And then in that process, we needed software to be able to produce our radon reports
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   and we got into home inspections and we developed new image software for that
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.400]   and sold that company a few years ago.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.800]   And this basically was looking for what's next step would be.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:46.200]   And my wife and I were both biohackers very interested in our health
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.400]   and started new image lifestyles.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.000]   Yeah, so that's awesome.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.800]   I mean, if you don't mind me sharing your age and just your activity level,
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.600]   I mean, you're basically not just talking the talk,
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.800]   but you're one of those individuals that walks the walk, right?
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.000]   Well, I discovered.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.600]   You want to share your idea and how active you are.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   You blow me away because you're way way out there.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.800]   I'll be 78 in January.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:27.800]   And when we moved from Texas back to Indiana in 2015,
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.600]   I was always a gym rat and so I'm in the local YMCA lifting weights
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.400]   and I kept hearing this sound over the balcony down on the gym floor
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.200]   and I look over there and these people were using these paddles
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.400]   and they were hitting a wiffle ball.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.800]   And after about a month, I finally walked down there and asked what this game was all about.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.000]   And a lady slapped a paddle in my hand and I started playing
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.800]   and I've been playing ever since.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   I've probably played three to four times a week
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.200]   and play at a high level competitive level.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.000]   And I just love the game of pickle ball.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And it's the fastest growing sport in the nation right now.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.600]   Yeah, I actually mentioned this to my daughter and she said she was playing pickle ball.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   And I'm like, I'm like, how the way?
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.400]   She's like, oh, everybody's doing it now.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.400]   And I'm like, I thought that was just her older folks.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.000]   And I got a big education on what pickle ball is like,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.200]   I never even heard of it to you mentioned it to me.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.200]   But no, that's awesome.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.400]   I mean, you're competitively playing a sport at 77 as a biohacker,
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.000]   you know, basically walking or, you know, talking and walking the talk, just is amazing to me.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.200]   And kind of a testament that, hey, you've made, you know, you've made some right choices for your health,
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.600]   which is what it's all about, right?
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.800]   So, yeah, I mean, it's great to be able to chat with another biohacker who's out there doing stuff.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.600]   So, you know, you have this.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.800]   So how long have you had your new venture called new image lifestyles?
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.400]   Like how long has that been around?
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:12.800]   Well, we originally started it in, I believe it was 2019 shortly after we had sold our software company.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:25.800]   And we started selling supplements and we, you know, had our website and everything was building well.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   And then along came COVID and people like Square and the different merchants pay out.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   They all at the same time canceled our accounts because we were selling, you know, this whole horrible supplement called CBD.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.800]   And just because we had CBD on our website, they canceled us.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:57.600]   So, you know, we, we, of course, had to pull back.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.400]   We couldn't sell anything without a website and a merchant processor and started looking for that.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:14.600]   Actually, you know, that's when I was really listening to your new things coming out, which we can talk about later,
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:23.200]   the new new services, hydrogen, and, you know, the 90, 10, which fill up morphed into Lilacu.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:30.800]   And that we just grew up with that and begin to experiment on ourselves.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.000]   Yeah, I remember when you were tinkering around a lot, we were sharing notes in the early days of that stuff.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.400]   So, so, okay, so now new image lifestyles.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:45.200]   So this is a new, your new company been running it for a few years and it's kind of morphed into just selling supplements.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:52.800]   But when I was, I'm going to show everybody the site and just kind of just let's explore like, you know, what is the service you provide now?
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.800]   Like what are the, I mean, do you sell products, do you sell services, do you do consulting?
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.800]   I mean, you've got all this experience and you've got all these tools.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:08.400]   So, you know, what's, what's the, like, what's the general, you know, idea behind your company now?
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:18.600]   I think more than anything, we are trying to be an example, a model of how anything is going to work.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:41.400]   It's going to have to work in your own life, obviously, and we, we have, you know, been big supplement users for ever since my wife and I've been married 23 years and last summer, we just had this gnawing feeling.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:47.200]   You know, you read about magnesium theory that's filling, you know, even, even the good supplements.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:09:01.200]   You go in and you look at the ingredient label and you find magnesium steroid in there and, and, you know, we were concerned about, you know, the load that that was putting on our livers and we were looking for another way.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   And so that was kind of the, the beginning to moving over into water-based supplements with frequency, which we can talk about whenever you want to talk about that.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   But, you know, our goal is really to encourage others to do the same.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   You know, I, back in the radon days, I ran, had my run in with the state of Indiana because I was working with a local TV station to find out if there was radon around the state and we did some testing and found it.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   And the next thing we knew, you know, our company was being attacked by the state for actually finding radon in the soil.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   So we did not don't want to do that again because, you know, we're all, you know, moving targets that anything we say can and will be used against us.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   So we decided to make new image lifestyles of private membership association. So, so if you understand, that's a lot of the alternative healthcare systems are going that direction where everybody just pays a small membership fee.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   And now we're private or no longer out in the public. I'm not offering anything to the public.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.200]   Okay. I'm looking for people who already have a clue.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:56.200]   And that are wanting to be educated. And that's really what we're doing. We, we do offer services to where people can come in. They can sign up and, and have remote services done primarily since, you know, it's hard to get to geographical location.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   And then we hope that they'll do the same.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.200]   Okay, go out and help other people.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:17.200]   Yeah. Okay, so everything we, everything we do is on a, is on a donation basis. Okay, that's a suggested, I'd suggested fee of what it would be worth, but, you know, if you can't afford it, we're still still going to help you.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   Okay, so that's the structure of the company. That makes complete sense. I've actually am seeing a lot more wellness like wellness centers. I think even Dave Asprey has started something.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   I forgot the name he's got for it. It's some kind of, you know, he's creating like all these little wellness clinics around the country.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   And he's got the whole, you know, Dave Asprey thing, but he's doing the same thing where it's like, yeah, you know, to use this stuff, you have to be a member.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   And so that seems to be the new business model to kind of keep the FDA off your back. Yeah, exactly makes sense.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   And so let's talk about the different offerings that you have and, but the whole idea of if there's anything anybody's interested in, you know, they can always just contact you, but let's talk about the different things that you're, you're doing within, you know, new image lifestyles
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   and, and, and, you know, kind of like what you help with and, and just your experience, I think, is what's really helpful is just like what's your experience with this stuff.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   So, you know, I was looking at your website and the first three things that popped out at me are three things that are near and dear to my heart.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   In fact, I think in your, in your picture on your website, you've got a carbon 60 t shirt on which cracked me up. Yeah.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:34.200]   So, so, so what is your experience? You were just telling me right before the interview, I'd love for you to share the story, but, you know, your experience like how did you find out about carbon 60 and how long have you been taking it?
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   Um, I started here about carbon 60, I think in 2017, plus or minus a few months anyway, and I started taking a product I, I think I was taking it for a year.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:07.200]   And then I ended up because I was playing pickleball and needing more mobility because I basically had two torn rotator cuffs and bad knees.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.200]   And I went in for stem cell treatment.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:18.200]   And the day that I went in to have the procedure done.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:34.200]   And this was in the US I didn't go out I found a, an organization that was doing a nationwide study and they had 70 some odd locations, where you could actually get your own stem cells extracted from your body.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:51.200]   And then the raw stem cells injected back into your, in your joints, and back into your, your bloodstream, which don't know where to get that done would be normally to go to Panama or to Mexico or something.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   And of course it was, you know, a lot of the travel and everything could be expensive.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   And so I signed up, went up and met with this plastic surgeon who had been doing, had been part of this study, and he determined that we were, my wife and I both were, you know, good candidates.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   And so the day I go in to have the treatment done, I'm listening to one of the manufacturers who had a pod has a podcast out there.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.200]   And Ken Schwartz, I think you know, Ken.
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   Yeah, purple.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.200]   Purple power.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:37.200]   And that was the one that play, or that, uh, Cliff high, it was, was his buddy.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.200]   Yeah, it's his buddy.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.200]   And so that I'd been, I'd have been taking it for about a year.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:52.200]   And Ken is on this video and I'm laying on my, on the operating table and the doctor is pumping through my belly button.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   He's got a long needle in there sucking the fat out of my belly, which fortunately, I guess I had plenty of work with him.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.200]   And, and what they do is they pull that out and dissolve it and take the fat out of it.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.200]   And then you're just left with the cells, which can count.
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   So, in the, in the audio, this can is saying, yeah, we've had some of these, uh, anecdotal comments from people who have been taking purple power.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.200]   And they've noticed their sten cell counts were accelerated.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   And I'm laying there and I'm not believing that I'm hearing this, you know, as a guy is feverishly pumping on my belly, you know, that there's sten cells.
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:46.200]   So I didn't say anything and you have to wait a couple of hours for them to extract the cells from the fat.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   So we went to lunch and came back and I go in for the, for the procedure where they now inject those same cells.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   And I'm all hooked up.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   I got an IV drip ready to, to receive the cells and had painkillers injected into my knees and my shoulders.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   And these doctors come running into the office together, holding up a, a handful of syringes with my cells on them.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   And, and they just both said, well, what in the world are you doing?
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   And I said, what do you mean, what am I doing? I'm having stem cell.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   No, no, no.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.200]   And they pointed at the cells.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:32.200]   They said, you have this, you have the stem cell count of a teenager.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   Now, what are you doing?
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:42.200]   And I said, I can't tell. I said, only thing I know is I'm taking something called C 60 because I just heard the video, you know.
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   And they said, well, we don't know what that is. Whatever you're doing, keep doing it because this right here is gold.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   And then I had done three years of what's called PRP platelet rich plasma treatments, which can be quite painful.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   So now I'm sitting here and they, you know, they come in with one injection and a shoulder.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:13.200]   They do both knees to give me the ID. The whole process, you know, was in less than 30 minutes.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:19.200]   And Northern with the PRP, I had to wait two weeks before I came back to playing pickleball.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:26.200]   And I, so I asked the doctor, said, when can I start playing? And he said, tomorrow.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   That's interesting.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   And right now everybody's want to know how much does that cost? That was $10,000.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.200]   I just for this stem cell treatment was 10 grand. Wow.
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   Did you feel better? Well, I mean, you know, it worked.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.200]   Oh, cool. Okay.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   Oh, and on the website, there is a short video of my story and of me playing, you know, shortly right after.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   I had been doing, you know, some of these treatments.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:06.200]   And he said, it'll be three months before you get, you know, your full recovery in your left shoulder.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:14.200]   I'm left handed is and to and right almost to the day of the treatment, it was three months.
[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:21.200]   And, you know, I couldn't lift a tray of lasagna, you know, at the dinner table.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   Without excruciating pain in my shoulders with these torn rotator cuffs.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:34.200]   And I'm telling you, you know, I was, I was playing and I was playing pain free.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:46.200]   And, you know, when I hit an overhead smash, I would have a little tingle for that first 90 days, but today, you know, I'm, I still playing on a word talking.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   We're gonna have many years to probably close to five years now. Okay.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.200]   So the effect lasted five years and it's all about.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:19:06.200]   Basically, it's a stem cell treatment, but predicated on the fact you're taking C 60, which raised your stem cell count in order for the stem cell treatment to been of that effective. So, okay.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:20.200]   Oh, you know, you didn't you tell. Didn't you tell someone the story back in the day? Because I were distinctly remembers somebody's, you know, maybe a good have been canned or someone else.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   Okay, yeah, because I had to because I had to have watched and one of his, you know, remember, he used to do the C 60 show with his marketing lady.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:39.200]   I got, I got, I got to believe that there's a video out there where he shared this story, but I never knew it was you, but you're, you're the guy.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:52.200]   You're the guy you talked about. Okay. Wow. Small world. Okay. So, so do you make your own C 60 oil or, or, you know, I have bought it.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:20:01.200]   And well, I never made my own C 60 oil. I was purchased it.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:14.200]   I watched all your videos and thought, you know, do I, do I have time to do this? My answer was no, but, you know, and because at that time, remember, I was selling supplements. So I was buying.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:24.200]   Okay. You know, I did, I did purple power and I did, oh, the other one they, they went to tablets. Live longer.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.200]   Live longer. Right.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:32.200]   Live longer labs that's filled out the cotliano and max champion site. Right. Okay. Great guys. Okay.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:44.200]   I'm just reselling their products then through on your. Yes, I would just resell on them. Good products. Yeah. And of, yeah, now I make my own water. So I'll just say that.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   Oh, you make your own.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.200]   Well, I make it with water frequency.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   Oh, okay. All right. Yeah. We'll talk about that.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:21:01.200]   Well, everybody, you should pay attention to that story, but okay. So next one up is the browns gas, the hydroxy therapy.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   Did you get this idea from me or you know, George from you? Oh, okay. Absolutely. I listened to your interview with George.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   I don't actually have. Yeah. I never haven't. I got to interview him one of these days, but I've done videos about him. I just got to get him on the line.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   Right.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   So how is that journey going for you? I mean, because I've, I'm actually plugged into one mine. I'm plugged into mine right now. I'm always plugged into it if I'm sitting down.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   I love it. We love it. We, my wife and I share it, breathing at night. We, we run that we crank it down to very low. And so that we're always maintaining a maximum.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.200]   I mean, because you can reach saturation in what half an hour or less.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:57.200]   At the levels that he recommends. So we just, we just, you know, if we're sitting around and listening to videos or something in the evening, one of us will will breathe and then.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:09.200]   The other one will breathe it all night long. And we just, we've done that now. I just looked at the, the hour meter on our machine a couple days ago.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.200]   And we're at 20,000 hours.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.200]   Yeah, I can, I can imagine.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.200]   I have no idea what mine is. I'm on my third machine.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:29.200]   They keep breaking down. Oh, yeah. But, you know, I went and bought three different kinds and three different models.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   Yeah. Right.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:40.200]   But the aquicure, the aquicure has been fine for us. I've replaced a fan, the cooling fan, and that's only thing I've had to change.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:49.200]   Okay. So, okay. So you're an affiliate for live longer labs. You're affiliate for purple power. So you're an affiliate for ego research, then selling aquicures.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:58.200]   I'm, I'm affiliate for ego. I'm not affiliate for either the supplements, because I'm not selling it. I quit selling supplements when you acquire and all them.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:09.200]   Oh, okay. So you do quit selling. Okay. Yeah. And, and so I try to avoid, you know, selling products. I'd rather just sell services and, and help people.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:24.200]   Okay. Sorry. So, okay. So the next thing, the next bullet I wanted to talk about in terms of the, the stuff that falls under the umbrella of new image lifestyles is, is the, the quantum pulse, formerly known as the vibe machine.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:31.200]   And this is where I got, I got the idea to get one from you. So it goes both ways by the way.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   Because you got, you emailed me December, right? Talking about you, you started being one of the vibe centers, right? Well, actually, what do they call them? No, they don't call them vibe centers. All right.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:24:00.200]   You know, that they really don't even promote. Yeah, they just have an individual. They sell you the machines. No, that's basically. I think there's a, there's a, if you go to their website now, then there's actually a link that says find practitioners or something like that.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   Yes. Right. Are you, are you on that list then? So you're like, well, you know, I don't know. And, and at the time I checked when I, when we bought that we bought this at Thanksgiving last year.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   Yeah. And, and there was no one in our area at all. And the ones that they were listed were no longer selling it or no longer doing it.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:36.200]   Because they've been around a long time. So could you, I think for anyone who doesn't know, who hasn't seen that video that I made or heard about this, but we're talking about this device right here.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:46.200]   And you want to give like just a short introduction of what that is and, and, and what you're offering in terms of a service because I know you're in between houses right now.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:25:01.200]   But back in December, you actually had it set up in one of your rooms where people could come and take sessions right but, yeah, if you don't mind, can you go ahead and explain that for anyone who doesn't know what a quantum pulse devices.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:08.200]   And basically it's, it's a, it's a Tesla tower.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:15.200]   There in the, in the center. It's got there is a power supply in the, in the base of it.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:26.200]   And then at the very top, there's, it's, it's basically it's a toroidal shaped ring with copper windings on it.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:37.200]   In that area of the clear tubes, those all hold inert gases, and they pass high voltage through that.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   And so you're getting your bio photonic light therapy out of that, you're getting scalar out of the top, and then you got electromagnetism out of the base.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:59.200]   So you're really getting kind of a threefold. And I compare this to the systems that are all the rage out there right now.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   Sandra Rose Michaels, you know, we actually went several times and had the overnight treatment of that.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   Okay.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   Doing a sleepover, but, you know, it's like, okay, these, you're, you're talking about the one we went to was like a quarter million dollars worth of equipment.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   And we wanted something that we could have in our home to do on a regular basis because, you know, I was studying, you know, about cell voltage.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:51.200]   And, you know, we measured, and we're, I've become very comfortable with using pendulums for testing different all kinds of things, you know, and this was my body and so forth.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:27:05.200]   And we, we had a natural path, a friend that did what did the overnight session and he tested all of our cell voltages before and after.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:20.200]   And everybody had an increase in cell voltage. So that kind of like turned on a light for me because of my background in the electrostatics and high voltage and with the machines that I had was building back then.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   And I thought, you know, this really feels a lot like that, sitting in a high voltage field.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:45.200]   So that kind of triggered my interest in testing cell voltage and I would encourage anyone who can use a pendulum or dowsing rods to test their bodies functions.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:53.200]   Start testing your cell voltage, because I started in April of this year.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:59.200]   And I was really concerned about what's the quantum pulse, how is that helping us?
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:11.200]   And we started seeing an increase in it, but I'm not convinced that it was the quantum pulse that was causing this increase because the increase became very, very dramatic.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:17.200]   And I'm not even going to quote numbers publicly what we're seeing now.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:21.200]   But as we all know, there is a shift in consciousness.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:34.200]   There is something going on, obviously, with a human residence, a residence and just test every day and follow that and see what your cell voltage is doing.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:44.200]   Okay, so now for folks that don't know how to do that, what's your quick and dirty way to do that to measure your cell voltage every day.
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.200]   I just do it with a pendulum.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:29:02.200]   All right. And, and I suspend the pendulum and I say, I just say is, is my cell voltage at or above a certain number.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:13.200]   Okay, so let's say, is my cell voltage 60 minus 65 millivolts or higher and 65 millivolts.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:22.200]   If you've read any of Jerry Dr. Jerry tenants information that's kind of like where your body is in it's really gearing into its healing mode.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:30.200]   And if you get up to 70, wow, you are, you are really cooking.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:40.200]   And, and so, you know, I'm, I'm, you know, trying to figure out, okay, is this happening because of supplements that we're taking?
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   I honestly have no idea where my success has come from, because I do so much stuff all the time.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:30:03.200]   I'm always doing something different every day. So I kind of gave up. I'm trying to be better at it where I just do like one new thing a month.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:14.200]   That's what I'm trying this year. And I'm actually eight. So then I could actually tell people, oh, I did this. And this is what changed, you know, up until then I do four or five different things every week.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:23.200]   I'm always trying new supplements.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:35.200]   I'm major. Oh, I'm a major supplement junkie. But so to wrap up, though, now I just want to point out to, so now you own, are you having your possession, one of these quantum pulse devices.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.200]   Also, it's formerly known as the Vibe machine.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.200]   The Vibe machine.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:49.200]   When interested, I did a huge video research project on these things. And when, and when you got one, I had biohack envy.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:56.200]   I went looking, you know, this is a short story. So I'm like, Oh, well, we know one of these things costs. And so I just went on eBay.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:05.200]   And I'm looking for a Vibe machine, right, just to see where, you know, what they run and because you were talking about it and you got me all excited about it.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.200]   And you were excited.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   Oh, I was because I, because I moved from Hawaii and I got rid of my Likovsky multi wave oscillator, because it was just too freaking heavy to move right. It was just not worth the price.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:23.200]   And I found someone that wanted it. And so I just, I sold it real cheap to the guy. And so I didn't have one. I didn't have a big, you know, toy.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   I sold my favorite toy. And so I was jonesing for a new toy. And so I went on eBay. And there was a guy in Colorado. I live in Missouri. The guy was in Colorado.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:44.200]   And he was selling a nova light, which, which is the sister machine to this guy from a, it's just made by a different guy. Same thing. And almost the same thing.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:53.200]   Anyway, so the guy in Colorado, he's saying, I mean, he had an ad on eBay. And he was selling it for like, I think it was like four grand. It was like, yeah, four grand.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:32:01.200]   And I'm like, no kidding. Cause I know these things brand New York, like 12 or 13,000. So I just said, Hey, you know, I contacted the guy and I'm like, you know, I'll come pick it up.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:12.200]   And he's like, sure, come on over. And that led to a three day 1500 mile journey. Me, my dogs. And I dragged my daughter along as navigator.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:24.200]   And we went and picked that thing up the week before Christmas. I love it. I love you every day. I love that thing. It's my favorite toy. Okay, somebody going back to your start.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:30.200]   So now we use ours. Like we were, we've been using it until we moved three times a day.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:51.200]   Okay. So the idea of this thing though, is that people would actually, if I recall from Jean Coons, the inventor of the quantum pulse, he mentioned in an interview that I think it was like 60% of his, his customers were, were clinics and practitioners and then 40% were private individuals.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:33:06.200]   And so the whole idea behind having it as a business tool was, they called them vibe centers back in the day, right, where you have a vibe machine and you'd have it in your clinic and people would sit around it just like with the biocharger, right?
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   They never, there's this newer model of this thing called the biocharger. And so, so that's kind of what you set up in your home was a vibe center, right, where people come and use the machine.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:28.200]   So, are you going to be, just my question, are you moving, you're in between houses. So in your new location, are you going to be, you know, setting up another vibe center to share this with people? Yes.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   Oh, cool. Okay, cool. And you're in Indiana, right?
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:40.200]   Or Indiana, right? Okay, so yeah. So if anyone's interested in, in your in Indiana, contact Rich, if you want to try a session with the vibe machine.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:45.200]   But you also, you also plug people into your aqua care why they're doing that.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:50.200]   They can. Cool. Absolutely. Lots of toys. Lots of toys.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:57.200]   Which are all shown on our website. Yeah, it's kind of, it's very expensive to talk to Rich personally, guys.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.200]   That cost me five grand.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.200]   Last time I talked to you, I was like five grand.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   Yeah, with that include travel. Yeah, but I didn't sell that to you. I know, but boy, I tell you, once I saw yours, I was like, man, I don't want one.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   Yeah, you just can't help yourself sometimes, right? Good ideas. I'm glad. Well, I'm glad they were sharing ideas. So now here's another idea that you pitched to me that I just, I thought was fantastic.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:32.200]   And this is another, this is a service you provide, right? So you've went ahead and signed up to be a Sola, or so, like, O scan.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:43.200]   So you, you have a licensed for the software. And then you, does that, and that's all, that allows you to do scans of other people. Is that how that works as a service?
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   Yeah, it's basically, this company started, well, up till COVID, they had a machine. If you look it up on the internet, they sell for about 35,000 starting and they will go up into the $40,000 range.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:20.200]   And, you know, it was a console, you'd see it in a doctor's office, and they were working just before COVID, they were working on taking a process, a portion of it called inner voice where they analyze your voice.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:32.200]   And they do a, do a whole analysis, emotional and physical and all this and it, they were shoehorning that down into a phone.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   And my naturopath again introduced this to me and said that he had one and, and he would bring it over to the house to show us.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:53.200]   And, and so he's can't come in, I'm expecting to be carrying this big big box that I saw on the internet, and he had a little box that was the phone in it.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:36:12.200]   And he, you know, run the scan on my wife and, and, you know, said, you know, look into that, see what you think well we, we did, and got into that and signed up for their, their subscription service, which is $149 a month.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   And being a hacker and a tech, a software guy for 35 years.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   I didn't want to use their Android device, I wanted to use my Apple device and I was basically able to hack it to where I could do that.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:42.200]   And use it on my iPad, I'd like to see it on a, on a bigger screen, rather than the smaller, smaller phone screen.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:55.200]   So what you do is you use a pair of a bone conducting headset, and you put this on your head, and it will run a series of scans.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:09.200]   And it's absolutely remarkable, because, because of COVID, they could no longer go out and call on doctors and sell their big console unit.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:20.200]   And they started quickly trying to move everything over onto a handheld device, and they've been amazingly successful at doing this.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   This is technology that came out of the Russians with, for their frequencies, the libraries of thousands and thousands of frequencies are right inside the machine.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:40.200]   And what it, what it does, it scans, it will scan your, your entire body.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:55.200]   One of the scans is like 3000 items in just a few minutes, and it will, it will tell you what it is at that moment, because everybody's heart should be the same frequency.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:05.200]   And if it's not, they have the way to what they call optimize, they will send the correct frequency into that organ, all happening automatically.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:18.200]   And you get a real report that tells you, you know, what things are in the green and what, what things are in the red, and you can run these scans repeatedly through the day.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:34.200]   So I liken this to a musician who's got a guitar. And if he's ever seen that the demonstration where you have a guitar sitting on one side of a room has a microphone in front of it and another one on the other side.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:54.200]   And when you pluck the string on one of the guitars, the one on the opposite side, the string that is tuned, the same note will vibrate, and it will play this down and the audience can hear that over over the loudspeakers.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:39:04.200]   But if you take that string and you get it cranked too far out of out of pitch, it won't do anything. And that's the way our bodies work.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   So this service, what it does is that it allows you to constantly tune your body and every organ in your body, your lymph system, your blood on everything.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:39.200]   And it gives you a real quick report of how it works. Now the company does sell, you know, other other things, but their key product is this subscription, which will now run on your own phone, or your own iPad, or your own, you know, laptop.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:55.200]   And you just the key is you have these bone conducting headsets you see here in the picture, that you just wear over your ears. And so the, it's not going through your auditory system it's going through, it's going through the bone in your jaw.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:16.200]   And to me, this, this is the starting point for anybody who's serious about body, biohacking, to be able to know what your body's doing at any time, you can just run these scans you can see, I just had a horrible head cold.
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   And I use this, you know, constantly hammering, and I fight high blood sugar, I don't take anything, any medicines for it, I control totally with frequency.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:43.200]   And, you know, that's why I'm very careful to not tell anybody that, you know, this is going to do this for you. This is what it does for me.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:50.200]   This is my testimony is that I control my blood sugar through frequency.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:41:05.200]   And there's two ways of doing that. One is wearing the headset doing doing the run in the scan, which can take from a little over one minute, one scan, and then another scan that takes takes four or five minutes.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:13.200]   And I can see during the day, you know, how I'm doing, and if something's dripped a little bit, I can bring it right back in.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:34.200]   The other thing that I do, before each meal, I do a scan, it will tell me what foods I should avoid at this time, which is, you know, great, I mean, don't eat, you know, chicken today, you know, but you're good for beef.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:44.200]   And it has a whole selection. So, you know, let your food be your medicine and medicine to your food. That's the whole concept there.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:42:03.200]   And the other thing that this does is, as it's running its scan, if you take your supplements and you put them into the system, in other words, you scan the frequency into the system.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:12.200]   It will tell you what supplements you need to take the top six supplements you need to take at this moment.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:26.200]   So, so it scans you, or you scan your supplements and it tells you which one you scan yourself.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   My wife was was a nutritional consultant for standard process, which is an old mainline system you see in all the chiropractors offices and naturopaths.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:42.200]   So, we had all of these supplements that she had access to. So, we just scanned them all.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:48.200]   And we put the frequencies of them into our light, our personal libraries.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.200]   Oh, okay. Okay.
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:58.200]   So, you just take it just take one of the pills, if you put a dose, you know, if a dose is one pill, you put the pill on your screen and you scan it, just takes a few seconds.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:04.200]   And then you might do us do another scan with, with two of the tablets.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:09.200]   So, your body is able to tell you this is the cool thing.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.200]   Your body is now telling you what it needs.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.200]   Okay, so we're not guessing.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:19.200]   Because, you know, we all do this. We take handfuls of tablets because we think we might.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:25.200]   Every day. Yep. Yep. Yep. And we don't know what we need. We just take them all.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:37.200]   And now, what are you doing? You're putting a load on your liver that, you know, this can be really heavy if you're taking a lot like we were handfuls.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   Yeah. Well, I have very expensive pee. I think if I can find a way to sell it, I probably can support the entire third world nations.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:50.200]   There you go. based on how much supplements I take and pee out.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:54.200]   So, it's a shotgun approach, but this is interesting.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:59.200]   Okay, wait a minute. Okay, I'm sorry. So, this thing is a diagnosis tool.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:09.200]   Based on a physical thing you stick on your head, but it, but can it also treat you with sending frequencies back to you like a CNR.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.200]   So, it's both diagnostics and treatment. Okay, it's both.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.200]   Can you do that? Yes.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.200]   Oh, how do you do that?
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:26.200]   Well, during COVID, I told the story of my grandson, who was in intensive care, they were trying to kill him at the hospital.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:34.200]   Yeah, and all that. And they're saying, you know, we were, we were sending all the love we could to him.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.200]   Totally remotely.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:43.200]   So, it works the same way as your Leela, where you could have picture, you put a picture of them in the cube and.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:48.200]   This, they call Sephi subtle energy frequency imprinting.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.200]   Okay.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.200]   And so, you've got all these menus and all the different.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:45:01.200]   You can make all your own custom blends for each of each of your, your clients.
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.200]   Oh, for yourself, your family members.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.200]   That's really cool.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:14.200]   So, so this is part of your service, then, because, okay, so my first thought was when you mentioned this to me before was, I just don't have 150 bucks a month.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   You know, and so, but so if you were to like, if someone were to approach you and say, Hey, I want to join your, your, your membership thing, and then what would you charge them?
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.200]   I get, or is it just all donation?
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:33.200]   Well, if we have a, we have a, we have a suggested and there's different scans, but, you know, it's good.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:38.200]   You know, it could be from 25 to up to $100.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.200]   Okay, as the suggested.
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.200]   Okay.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.200]   All right.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:52.200]   Our, honestly, our real goal is to get most people what they'll do is they will have that first scan then.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.200]   Right.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:46:00.200]   And, and, and hopefully they've had the kind of experience that many of ours have had where it was just like.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:04.200]   Within hours, their condition changes.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:12.200]   And, and so now they want to look into doing this themselves because by the time you come to us.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:19.200]   You know, a couple times a month to have a scan done, you've just got your own machine.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:24.200]   And because this is sold, sold through affiliate marketing marketing network marketing.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:29.200]   You get, for every person that you have signed up, you make $50 a month.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.200]   So three people and now this is paid for.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.200]   Okay.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   But, but the real thing that pays for it is we typically would spend somewhere in the neighborhood of $600 a month on supplements, sometimes more.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.200]   It's not hard to do.
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.200]   You know, it's easy.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:47:00.200]   And now we have found, you know, we were immediately we found that we cut that in half.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.200]   So right there, the system paid for itself.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.200]   It's a new brainer.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   Cool.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   Okay.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.200]   Okay.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:15.200]   So you're, so you're an affiliate for the cert, you know, for the, the, so it's hardware and subscription, right?
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.200]   And you're an affiliate for that.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:28.200]   But if people don't want to go through all of that and they just want to try it, then they can go to you and you could run a, you could run a scan on them and, and produce a report. And you've actually sent me reports.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.200]   I won't pull one up, but it's a very intensive report.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.200]   I'm going to see why you sent me so many samples.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:41.200]   Let me just see if I can find one just to show it what it looks like.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:49.200]   Yeah, I'll scan. Here we go. Classic vitals report. So I'll just pull this puppy up.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:54.200]   People can kind of see what so it does put out a pretty big report.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:48:00.200]   And there's all your foods, all the different foods, green, good, red out. Okay.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.200]   So today, bad day for sheet milk. Okay, good to know.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:13.200]   And the only thing you're, the only thing that you paid much attention to is what are called double reds where they're both red before and after like this one right here.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.200]   Don't eat the stachios to it.
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.200]   The stachios.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.200]   Okay.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:23.200]   So what happens is you learn about your body and, and you, you know, the stachio blood.
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.200]   This is this is blood.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:32.200]   So blood too. So you get all these different analysis on your blood quality or blood.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:35.200]   And it's educational.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   I didn't, I didn't know what this stuff was when I got this meridians gastrointestinal functions.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.200]   It does all your meridians.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.200]   There's your, your chakras.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:54.200]   So right here, your nutritional analysis is where it's going to basically tell you.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.200]   Like.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.200]   So when it says something like this selenium in, in, right.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:02.200]   Does that mean you should be taking selenium today?
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.200]   No, that means that everything's good.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.200]   Oh, they're good.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.200]   Okay.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.200]   So the, you're deficient in.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.200]   Double outs are what you want.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.200]   Okay.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.200]   Okay.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.200]   So here we go.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.200]   Here's a double out on B three.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.200]   Right.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.200]   Okay.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:23.200]   Oh, this is, so you're basically running a scan on yourself every day and only taking supplements.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.200]   That your body's telling you it needs.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:29.200]   So like today would be, you'd only take niacin today.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.200]   Is that kind of how you would do it?
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:38.200]   Well, no, actually when it runs, this is, this is called the Bitals report, but it looks at everything.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:45.200]   So, um, so intensely that it'll give you the top six things that you should.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   You should consider taking out.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.200]   That was this other picture.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:49.200]   Okay.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.200]   So that's this guy right here.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.200]   So let me show.
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.200]   Okay.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.200]   So this is what you get.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.040]   Let me just show, make sure people can see what that looks like.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.600]   So this is the top six.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.320]   So it gives you, and this is in the app, right?
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.800]   So they'll just tell you today, you need these.
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.200]   And then it's that simple.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:06.200]   Wow.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:10.440]   And see the number, even the number of capsules, like you should take two capsules, uh, two
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:22.320]   mic, uh, three of l theanine, uh, two of magnesium orate, uh, the back says a liquid supplement
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:29.840]   that is made by my naturopath friend, um, blood sugar balance, one dropper fall, and
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:37.120]   uh, some potassium iodide, um, and it's however you put it into this, to the library is what
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.120]   it feeds back.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:42.080]   So, okay, it'll look and say, okay, well, you know, do you need one?
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.840]   No, you need three, three capsules.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.840]   Okay.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:46.840]   Okay.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.680]   So you tell it what you have in your cabinet and it'll tell you what.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.680]   Right.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.680]   Cool.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:53.680]   Okay.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:56.600]   So, so what we've done here, it's just like with a Leela cube.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:03.080]   We just take this, take the supplements and we put them, we put them in a, I put them
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:08.520]   in a little shot glass instead of on top of my, my phone or my iPad and run a scan, it
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.920]   takes just a few, a few seconds.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:15.320]   And now it permanently is in my library.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.080]   And anytime in the future, I, I need that frequency.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.720]   It looks and sees you got that or I need to optimize with it.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.720]   It'll, it'll do that for you too.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:24.720]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:25.720]   You got it.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:26.720]   You have to make this.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.720]   Oh man.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.800]   You're talking me into buying another thing, Rick.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:30.800]   Rich.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   Sorry.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.800]   Oh, okay.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:38.760]   But now, you know, no, because as a biohacker, my biggest Achilles heel as a biohacker is
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:45.520]   I don't have a kick butt diagnostic tool by which to direct my decision making.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.080]   I wouldn't get a deck of all, but I'm horrible.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:53.320]   I got this really bad habit where I buy gizmos and they go on the shelf and I just got to
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:57.280]   get off my butt and learn how to use my deck of all because that's what I got it for.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.760]   I just, anyway, my wife is, and I can talk to my wife.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:05.920]   But she do it too.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:13.320]   Well, my wife is, my wife is absolutely non techie.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.920]   She hates technology.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:15.920]   All right.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.920]   I mean, she'll go under the web, but she hates, I mean, if it's, if it's not working perfectly,
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.080]   you know, she's not using it and easy.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:32.440]   She would fight you if you try to take this from her, she loves it.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:38.520]   And it's like it's number one to know what your condition is because your body will tell
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.520]   you what it needs if it's got a way to talk to you.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:48.160]   And this is the way that your body can give you feedback, which is absolutely amazing.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:54.480]   And then to think of not only feedback, it can give you therapy because it runs these frequencies
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:57.000]   automatically for you.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.480]   Well, you know, that's why that's why I actually went back back in the day I went and got the
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:07.640]   full spooky to jet when they came out with the new generator, the Gen X kit because of
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:12.360]   that feature of, yes, but it's all in the world of rife, not, not, not, you know, because
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:17.600]   this is beyond rife, but, but in the world of the rife technology, you know, it's spooky
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:21.200]   to has a biofeedback program.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.760]   And it also has the treatment, right?
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:27.040]   But then what I, what I discovered over time and nothing, I'm not dishing the spooky
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:34.600]   two guys, but even John White of spooky to admits that his biofeedback is not very accurate,
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:38.760]   you know, and, and because every time you run it, you get different results as to what,
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:40.200]   what the problem is.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.200]   So and die.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.560]   So diagnostics is critical.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:46.320]   That's why I went and got, I got, I have that and there's, I just decided not to bother
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.320]   with it.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:50.560]   And cause I tried it a couple of times and I kept getting different results with spooky
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:55.000]   two, then I tried a decavole, but I'm just progressing.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.240]   So, you know, but this sounds like a really, really great alternative, especially since
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:02.240]   you're, you're giving right now testimony that it works.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:06.840]   But hey, I'm looking at just, but I'm looking at something on the, on the report.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:11.960]   So this thing will tell you if you've got a certain kind of bacteria or, or parasite
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:18.600]   because right here it's out out Michael, Michael Plasma, Genesis, right for genus.
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:22.200]   So this means that it'll identify a particular parasite.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.560]   Ooh, I didn't know that.
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:26.560]   Absolutely.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:27.560]   And I use that.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.560]   Funguses, toxins, minerals.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:29.560]   Go ahead.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:30.560]   Sorry.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:37.320]   And on I track, I track how many double reds that I have parasites, yeah, because parasites
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:44.360]   are a big deal and, and of course bacteria, but the parasites are really what my wife
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:49.040]   and I have been focusing on for the, probably, probably the last year.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:52.920]   And you know, when you, when we started with this, we had all these double reds and we
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.560]   were just like, oh, this is awful.
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:02.020]   But now it's down to if you have one or two and then the next day, they're gone.
[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:07.700]   So, yeah, this is a sample report of you right back in January, you shared me?
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:08.700]   Okay.
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:14.340]   So right back then it showed that you had a respiratory, something virus, sin, sin.
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:15.340]   Yeah.
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:17.020]   And the next day you probably had nothing.
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:18.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:22.700]   But I may have, I may have been, I may have, the program may have said, Hey, you need some
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:23.700]   fen den.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.700]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:29.460]   You know, and, and so, you know, it took fen den.
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:35.080]   So typically what, what we'll do is we'll try a supplement, just the physical supplement
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:36.780]   and we'll put it in there.
[00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:39.260]   And if we like it, we don't buy it anymore.
[00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:48.760]   We just copy it and I use a, I use, I use the Lelec cube, I use a, is the quantum block
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:49.760]   block.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:56.100]   And I use the block and I will, I, when you did the video on how to make new frequencies
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:02.020]   and everything on info pathenol that, that just triggered so much in me.
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:06.300]   And I thought, Oh, I'm going to, I'm going to convert every one of these supplements
[00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:07.300]   to a frequency.
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:13.940]   Then I'm going to use that frequency card, aluminum card like you use to make my water
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:15.140]   supplements.
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:21.860]   So it actually takes about 30 seconds for me to make my supplements from water.
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:23.420]   That's what we got here.
[00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.420]   Okay.
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:29.060]   First question, how long have you been doing this since, how long have, how long has it
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:36.000]   been since you switched from physical bills, one year last year, so you're, and now you're,
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.340]   so basically you, you've switched from physical supplements to the frequency of supplements.
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.340]   Right?
[00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:43.340]   Yes.
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:44.340]   Absolutely.
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:49.220]   And, and so you solely take the frequency of a supplement in place of physical and you're
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:53.600]   using AO scan to track your results.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:54.600 --> 00:57:01.500]   And AO scan is saying you are doing quite well, ie the frequencies are helping or, or, or,
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:06.980]   or else you would be one year later severely deficient and numerous, especially your age,
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:07.980]   nothing about your age.
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:08.980]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:12.780]   As I get older, I have way more issues every single day of my life.
[00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:16.820]   If I, I can actually notice if I stopped taking probiotics for a couple of weeks.
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:17.820]   Right.
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:18.820]   Yeah.
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:25.740]   So, you know, you, you have hit on one of the biggest questions of the Leila Q community.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:26.740]   Right.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:32.420]   Where so many people have come in and say, Hey, can I just, you know, uh, where the, you
[00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:33.580]   know, the heel capsule, right?
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:36.100]   Which has got all those, you know, the bio, neutral bio base.
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:40.580]   I think it's got, I don't know, like 80 something different supplement frequencies in it and
[00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:46.300]   people always ask, Hey, can I just wear this instead of taking the physical and save myself
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:47.660]   hundreds of dollars?
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:52.940]   And my answer has always been, we don't know, we just don't know, but you're someone who
[00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:55.780]   actually just tested this and you're going strong.
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:58:00.060]   So what we're looking at here, you shared pictures of me where when you were in your
[00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:04.100]   house, you're between houses, but this is what it looked like in your kitchen.
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:10.700]   And then now you're very organized rich and now I'm traveling.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:11.900]   You've got cases.
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:12.900]   Yeah.
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:16.400]   Well, this, this turntable was wonderful.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:23.260]   If you have, if you're if you're fixed, but now that we've been going through this moving
[00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:27.300]   cycle, it's like, okay, how do you find anything?
[00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:33.140]   Or imagine we were in a hotel a couple of weeks ago and I'm carrying a cardboard box
[00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:37.380]   with all these in it and I'm thinking, Oh, the bottom goes out of this in the lobby.
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:42.060]   And I've got glass and water and, and that plus I've screwed up my whole library.
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:46.700]   I got to put this stuffs valuable because you figure every one you see there, there's
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:52.500]   66 that you can put in one of these Pelican cases.
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:55.580]   They're about their size of a carry on.
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:59:00.020]   And I have two of these that are full, like you see there.
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.020]   Wow.
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.020]   Yeah.
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:05.820]   And, and I want to make a third one and I want to put all of my, all of my frequency
[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:14.940]   cards and a, a travel block in there so that I can create my supplements on the, on the
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:15.940]   run.
[00:59:15.940 --> 00:59:16.940]   Okay.
[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:20.180]   So I think, I think we need to, if we could take a step back now for anyone who doesn't
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:25.640]   know what we're talking about, you're mixing three separate modalities together, you're
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:28.220]   this like master tinker.
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:34.580]   So you've got the diagnostic tool AO scan that's telling you what you need and, and, and, and
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:39.540]   tracking your progress on deficiencies, which you've proven over a year now, you're just
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:43.340]   taking frequency as supplements, which is amazing.
[00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:46.500]   So that's, that is by far the most amazing thing.
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:52.700]   The second thing is you've created a, the, in order for AO scan to tell you what to take,
[00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:59.500]   you created a supplement library, right, to feed into that software now to actually create
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.500]   each one.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:05.940]   It says, like let's say AO scan says, Hey, you need to take L theanine, then you go over
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:11.460]   here to your, your, your collection or your supplements now, which are all just water
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:14.060]   imprinted with frequency.
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:19.780]   And you pull up the bottle that says the L theanine, which is water that has the frequency
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:25.740]   of L theanine imprinted water and you take some of that, right?
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:26.740]   That's correct.
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.740]   So the question to people who may not know how.
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:34.180]   So this is called, so how to create these little bottles of water, where each one of
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:38.980]   the bottles of water is a separate frequency, that's called imprinting.
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:44.620]   And so now that's where, and then the third tool that came into place, you've got AO scan,
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:48.140]   you've got the Layla block to transfer the frequency.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.940]   But then info path, he also does frequency imprinting, right?
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:52.940]   And that's right.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:57.820]   And so did you use that, because that's like this giant library on the internet of all kinds
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:58.820]   of frequencies.
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:04.500]   So instead of buying more supplements, just to copy them, right, right, you subscribe
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:10.500]   to info pathi and then used info pathi to then imprint the water directly without using
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.500]   a block.
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.500]   Right.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.500]   Correct.
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:18.940]   Well, actually what I do is I, as I directly play the sound like you did on your video.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:19.940]   Okay.
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:20.940]   All right.
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:21.940]   You did that.
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:22.940]   Okay.
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:29.460]   Well, a two ounce bottle of water that has been cleared, the bottles cleared, you know,
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:37.900]   the water is cleared, which you use function on the AO scan to just erase everything.
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:43.380]   And I play, it's usually about two minutes, you play the sound into the water.
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:46.740]   And now that becomes your master.
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:51.300]   I take the master and you can just do that every time if you want, but it's too much
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.460]   time.
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:02:00.220]   But if you just took that bottle, put it over in your, in your quantum block, along with
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:08.060]   a plate, copy it, copy it, copy it to the card, yeah, three minutes done deal.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:11.220]   And now I've got a bottle that I can start taking immediately.
[01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:17.180]   And I have, I have a master that I'll use when I need to refill my bottle, because I'll
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:22.620]   never have to go back to playing it as sound again through the info patty program.
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:23.620]   And this makes it.
[01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:24.620]   Okay.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:25.660]   So I, and so, and then, okay.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:32.060]   So what I'm thinking of is, because in the, in the Laila world, I would create a booster,
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.060]   right?
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:38.340]   And just, and then just carry that booster frequency, however, the booster frequency
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:44.580]   again is that same shotgun approach where I, you know, I have all 80 or 100, so this,
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:52.700]   this is a way to pinpoint or target exactly where I need to only take that and take it
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:53.700]   as frequency.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.200]   So you found a way to do it.
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.460]   And then you're just making cards to hold to just basically have a frequency library.
[01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:00.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:01.460]   Exactly.
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:02.940]   I just copied what you did.
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:06.420]   I just copied what you did on, on the info patty video.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.620]   Yeah, no, it's like, okay.
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:09.620]   I know you're brilliant.
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.620]   This is brilliant, bro.
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.340]   I mean, like biohacker master tinker stuff.
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.340]   This is awesome.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.260]   I didn't, I mean, I've, I've been thinking about how to do this.
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:22.180]   And I think you came up with, with the right approach, because definitely making a single
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:26.140]   card of every one of these wouldn't work because then you'd have to collect all six
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.700]   cards, put them in your pocket for the whole day.
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:31.100]   And I wouldn't even know how long you'd have to carry the card.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:34.860]   But this way, you're just, you're taking in the water, you're adding that water into
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:35.860]   your body.
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:36.860]   Okay.
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:37.860]   That's really blurb.
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:38.860]   That's brilliant.
[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:39.860]   Rich.
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:44.740]   I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'm saying is, wow, what are you doing this?
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:45.740]   Wow.
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:46.740]   We are, we are the guinea pigs.
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:47.740]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:55.700]   What is really amazing about this is, you know, when, when you're married, the, the
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:04:00.020]   ideal is, is that you are together, you are a one.
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:01.020]   Yeah.
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:09.620]   And it is absolutely phenomenal how that every day, my wife and I have several of the same
[01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:17.220]   supplements called for, oh, you know, that makes sense though, it's, it becomes so entangled
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.220]   with each other.
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.220]   Right.
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:23.900]   Some, I mean, this, this does get into quantum, yeah, it's real quantum stuff right there.
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:24.900]   Yeah.
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:25.900]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:33.060]   And it's just, it's just so confirming and encouraging to see your, your, both of your
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:35.740]   bodies are needing this particular frequency.
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:40.100]   Because what do you think I was a supplementing, at the same time, I need a frequency.
[01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:41.100]   You need a frequency.
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.100]   And we both take it.
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.100]   And then the next time you scan.
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:44.100]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:45.100]   We're both good.
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.740]   Well, you're always, you know, you're both eating the same stuff, doing the same activities.
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.540]   You're becoming one.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:50.540]   Yeah.
[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.540]   Exactly.
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:52.540]   I guess that's what they mean.
[01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.540]   What you become one.
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:54.540]   I guess that is.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:55.540]   Wow.
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:56.540]   Now, so there's so there's, okay.
[01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:57.540]   So here you go.
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:00.020]   I mean, this is, this is cutting edge science stuff.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:04.180]   There's two, there's a, it's a clinical trial of two human beings that have done this for
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:11.180]   a year, literally surviving off of the frequency of supplements for their supplementation.
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:13.580]   And you're, you're doing great.
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.020]   It's, it's successful.
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:16.700]   You're actually, and, and it's true, right?
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:21.140]   You've got better results now than when you first started in terms of like your health.
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:22.140]   Yes.
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:27.900]   And when you're having a vibrant pickleball playing comp, you know, competition, like, wow,
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:29.380]   that's so cool.
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:30.380]   That's so cool.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:33.260]   I'm so glad you, you had time today to talk about this.
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:35.220]   Cause I think this is amazing.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:36.500]   This is truly amazing.
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:42.620]   Cause this is exactly what people have been asking us is, can we switch to frequency?
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:46.540]   And now I can say, well, there's been a one year, two human trial.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:47.540]   And yeah.
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:48.540]   Right.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.540]   And we have died.
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:50.540]   It works.
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.540]   Yeah.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:52.540]   Wow.
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:53.540]   Well, okay.
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:54.540]   Cool.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:55.540]   So this is so cool.
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:56.540]   Anyway, so this is amazing.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.540]   Okay.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:58.620]   So now the next one, though, is this other thing you've got that I don't know is because I was
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:03.100]   looking at your website and you're like an affiliate for a neuro.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:06.700]   And I don't even know what, what is, so is that something you're active about?
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.460]   This, this is something different.
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:09.460]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:14.020]   This caught my attention, okay.
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:20.220]   Because I was trying another, another company came on board a year ago.
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:24.060]   And they were a licensee of a neuro.
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:31.940]   And what they were offering is the ability to use this program, it runs on your phone.
[01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:42.140]   And it uses the camera in your phone to, to imprint, to measure your face and to determine
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:48.020]   blood conditions, your, and they had one of the features was blood sugar and I wanted
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:51.100]   to track blood sugar without the pinpricks.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:53.780]   So I think it was like $30 a month.
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:56.260]   I signed up for that.
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:59.420]   And I've been using it for a year now.
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:09.340]   And, you know, they had, I got a, I wanted to find out more about how I could privately
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.220]   able that service.
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:19.660]   So this, a neuro product, I had a long conversation with the chief technology guy.
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:21.500]   And this is a sample.
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:24.580]   It doesn't have blood sugar, unfortunately.
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:29.620]   But it will measure all these other things.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:36.420]   And you can, you know, it'll do your heart and it'll tell you your skin age, you know,
[01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:40.900]   heart variability and all of that depression, body man.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:46.900]   And it's, and if anybody wants to go to our website, they can, they can download it free
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.900]   of charge.
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:49.740]   Oh, I don't sell it.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:51.740]   I don't make any money on it.
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:57.060]   But it is a teaser of, because they just give you enough to get you excited about it.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:58.060]   Okay.
[01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:03.860]   But it'll tell you your skin age, you know, I love it to look at this at 77 and tell me
[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:09.780]   my skin ages 53, you know, that makes you feel good, but it's real simple.
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:11.060]   You can just put it on your phone.
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:13.260]   It's their like version here.
[01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:23.880]   And what this is, what this is, is kind of AI moving into the health space where a company,
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:29.780]   let's say that you are a long haul trucking company and you've got drivers on the road
[01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:34.420]   and you, of course, you know, you got log books, which they all cheat on and not it.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:41.100]   But they want to have the drivers use this and it will actually measure all these, all
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:46.780]   these vitals, you know, and report back to them, you know, that, you know, that they're
[01:08:46.780 --> 01:08:49.780]   not doing what they should be doing or they are doing.
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:54.900]   They know that they got somebody that maybe has got some kind of a potential health risk
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:56.220]   coming up.
[01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:00.660]   So it's, it's, in one sense, it's big brother in another sense.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:06.220]   It's like, wow, this is, this is worth looking at to see where the feature is.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.220]   Yeah.
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:14.820]   Because one of the things, I call that I talk, I tell everybody that, that is in this space
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:18.820]   that, you know, they keep hearing about, oh, we're going to wait for the med beds to come
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:19.820]   out.
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:24.500]   I can't wait to get a med bed so that I can begin to, you know, take care of my body correctly
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.820]   or have it all mat magically fixed.
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:33.380]   Hey, your phone can become your med bed, your iPad can become your med bed because it's
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:38.820]   literally sending something back, it may not be, you know, reversing 40 years of age or
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:39.820]   whatever.
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:46.780]   But, or going on a limb, but it sure can help, you know, bring your body back into proper
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:47.780]   balance.
[01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:48.780]   Wow.
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:49.780]   Okay.
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:55.200]   So is this so a neuro is, it's a diagnostic tool using your face, kind of like the cell
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.660]   salts thing, right.
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:59.820]   And, and so just an evaluate your face.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:02.860]   So, but is it, is it just diagnostics or is it also?
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:08.500]   It's all just, it's just, it's just, it's just a diagnostic, just a diagnostic, but it's
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.500]   clever.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:14.940]   Everybody can get enjoy it and, and I just encourage anybody wants to try it.
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:16.780]   Don't ask me anymore than this.
[01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:17.780]   Okay.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:21.620]   So they can go on your side or they can go to that site and then give it a guess.
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:22.620]   Okay.
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:23.620]   Right.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:27.100]   Neurologics is a company and I just, they, they kind of, she kind of freaked out a little
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.260]   bit because they said, Oh, how many people you're going to have coming in and freaked
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:33.260]   out a copy to that?
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.260]   Well, and the more the merrier.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:36.260]   Right.
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.260]   Okay.
[01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:42.780]   So now we've talked about Leleque and, and you're using Leleque to create a frequency
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:43.780]   library.
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:46.860]   But what other type of tinkering do you do?
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:51.020]   Are you, are you using it, um, you know, as part of your, your membership services, like
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:54.300]   doing quantum healing through entanglement or, okay.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:55.300]   Okay.
[01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:56.300]   All right.
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.300]   How's that?
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:00.220]   I mean, so kind of, would you mind describing it and like, what are your results?
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:05.600]   And how's that well, you know, my, on, on my website, what I did is I made it so that
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:12.540]   somebody who wants the service can go in, take their picture, upload the picture, give
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:16.980]   us, give us, uh, right there.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:17.980]   Okay.
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:18.980]   Under services, member services.
[01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:19.980]   Okay.
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:20.980]   So you get, you click here.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:28.740]   And the first thing you have to have to do is, you have to become a member of our private
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:29.740]   membership.
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:30.740]   Oh, you got a joint.
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:31.740]   Oh, okay.
[01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:32.740]   Okay.
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:33.740]   Okay.
[01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:34.740]   Okay.
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:35.740]   So it's 25 bucks, you know, for a year.
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:36.740]   Okay.
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:37.740]   Okay.
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:38.740]   And, and, and then we can talk and we're not going to be suing each other.
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:39.740]   Does everybody understand?
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.740]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:51.140]   Um, but going back to, to the previous slide that you had there, uh, for Leleque.
[01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.140]   This one?
[01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:53.140]   What?
[01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.140]   Yeah.
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:55.140]   The latest thing.
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:59.100]   You know, listeners, I'm sure understand Lele and you've got hundreds of videos.
[01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.100]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.100]   I've got that.
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:02.100]   Yeah.
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.100]   A few.
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:04.100]   I've done a couple.
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:08.100]   And then you did this thing to me about the magnet there.
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:09.300]   Ah, I cost you money.
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.300]   That's, that's fair.
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:11.300]   It's fair.
[01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:14.540]   You paid, you paid, you put that video out.
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:20.260]   I bought the books, read the books, did you buy the magnets?
[01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:21.260]   And then I bought magnets.
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:26.140]   In fact, I now sell the magnets through Amazon to their affiliate program.
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:27.260]   There you go.
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:35.500]   So people, so people can, uh, and, and my biggest customers are the Michael Ball people.
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:36.500]   Yes.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:37.500]   Everybody hurts.
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:42.700]   You know, they got something heard and magnets, you know, here it's magnet pop it right on
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:44.700]   and, and oh, that's crazy.
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:46.500]   You know, pain went away.
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:52.860]   So, so you're, you're getting testimonials from your, your, uh, pickleball players.
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:53.860]   Right.
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:57.860]   And they're using the, you're, they're using the North Pole magnets on, on pain for pain
[01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:00.300]   and, and, and, and wow.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:05.620]   So you're getting, you're getting the same results that, uh, Davis and Rawls and Phil
[01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:07.300]   Pot and all those guys came up.
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:08.300]   Okay.
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:10.460]   So I'm glad you put the two items together.
[01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:11.460]   So cool.
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:16.700]   There's one more item that I no longer have on my website, but I blast September, my wife
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:23.980]   and I, uh, stepped into the world of patches and you're doing, oh, you're doing life wave.
[01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:24.980]   We did life way.
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:25.980]   Okay.
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:26.980]   I was going to ask you about cephy dots.
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:27.980]   Okay.
[01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:28.980]   So go ahead.
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:29.980]   This is good.
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:36.940]   So life wave, um, you know, is supposedly, you know, the, the way that it worked is, but
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:40.620]   it's basically light and frequency.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:46.820]   So, yeah, you know, I'm spending, I think my wife, we were spending six hundred dollars.
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:47.820]   Yeah.
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:48.820]   I tried it.
[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:49.820]   It was $600 a month.
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:56.700]   Because we were doing the X 39, the X 49 and I think that's a hundred and 49 right there.
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:05.260]   And then we did the, uh, uh, that's the one that for, for inflammation, um, glutathione
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:09.660]   one or the, uh, no, it was the melatonin one.
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:10.660]   We tried a bunch of them.
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.660]   Yeah.
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:12.660]   There's a bunch.
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:19.160]   And so I thought, well, you know, I just need to make some masters of those.
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:27.060]   And so I made masters, which again, I'm thinking, what do I do with the frequency of that?
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:32.900]   And how can I duplicate the efficacy?
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:36.220]   Because I really do think the life wave stuff was good stuff.
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.340]   Oh, yeah, it is.
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.340]   It's totally.
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:40.340]   It's got tons of studies.
[01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:41.340]   It's, it's real.
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:42.340]   It's real.
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:43.340]   It's legit.
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:44.340]   Yeah.
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:45.340]   It's just expensive.
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:46.340]   So expensive.
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:47.340]   I thought, hmm.
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:51.940]   That's what would K do in a situation like this.
[01:14:51.940 --> 01:15:00.100]   And so because I, you know, I had the physical product, I put those into frequency cards.
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:04.620]   And then I thought, what would happen if you put a magnet in there?
[01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:07.500]   Oh, that's right.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.500]   Okay, go ahead.
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.500]   So I remember that.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.500]   Okay.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.500]   I forgot about this.
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:18.300]   Instead, instead of wearing a patch now, which I have to spend $100 a month on, I wear
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:22.580]   a magnet that I paid a few bucks for once.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:25.900]   So like a little, little silly, a little like coin magnet?
[01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:26.900]   Yes.
[01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:29.460]   I use, I just the ones right on our website.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:37.740]   Very simple, you buy a pack of them of 20, I believe it's $25 for $25 and it comes with
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:40.220]   an advantage on it so that you can apply it once.
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:46.060]   But you know, if you follow the cycle of 12 hours on, 12 hours off, you'll end up putting
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:49.700]   just a piece of tape on it and use it.
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:50.700]   Yeah.
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:56.420]   And I made it for X 39, I put X 39, 49 and one other frequency.
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:16:01.940]   And you put whatever you want in it and, you know, the, the frequency is going to go into
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:03.460]   that magnet, stay in that magnet.
[01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:05.500]   It's not going to lead away.
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.740]   And you do like North Pole facing in?
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:08.740]   Yes.
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:09.740]   Okay.
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:10.740]   North Pole facing in.
[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:11.740]   Right.
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:16.380]   Ah, so you're using magnets instead of practice, little, little ones, and they have a little
[01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:19.060]   dimple on them on the, on the South Pole site.
[01:16:19.060 --> 01:16:20.780]   So you can tell really easy.
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:21.780]   That's really smart.
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:27.940]   Because I came up with the idea of just taking a band aid and a dime, just a 10 cent dime
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:31.900]   and just telling people, yeah, just put the frequency in the dime, but the magnet, you
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:32.900]   can combine the two.
[01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:33.900]   That's brilliant.
[01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:42.860]   If you're, if you're a, if you're a pendulum user, ask it how much more effective it is
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:43.860]   as a magnet.
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:45.660]   Oh, that sure is.
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:46.660]   Just right off the bat.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:47.660]   I get it.
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:48.660]   I get it.
[01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:49.660]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:50.660]   You know what?
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:51.660]   I'm not all about it.
[01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:52.660]   Boy, I should've.
[01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:53.660]   Yeah.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:54.660]   Okay.
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:57.820]   So it, and it helps to, I mean, have you, you're experimenting on you and your wife with
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:58.820]   these little.
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:16:59.820]   Yeah.
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:00.820]   We've been using them now for months.
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:07.700]   New image lifestyle patches, they're frequency charged, I owe magnets with band aids.
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:08.700]   Okay.
[01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:09.700]   Wow.
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:10.700]   That's great.
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:13.100]   So you just, whatever it needs, you just, okay, that's brilliant.
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:14.100]   Yeah.
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:18.860]   Cause I was going to ask you, and okay, so when we're talking about patches, I think we both
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:21.460]   agree that, you know, life waves, great, but it's pricing.
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:27.060]   If you want to do a DIY biohack, you know, use these little, I love the magnet idea.
[01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:29.660]   So, you know, instead of the dime, use a magnet.
[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:32.780]   But the thing about, I was going to ask you, cause I remember talking to you about this
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:34.460]   back in the day.
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:39.740]   And you know, there's this thing called seffi dots with the Solax AO scan.
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:45.020]   And it's, so it's part of the product set by which you can imprint, let's say you do
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:51.820]   a scan and it tells you you need glutathione, then you can have the device actually program
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:57.620]   one of these little seffi dots, which is a blank patch with the, with the frequency of
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:00.740]   glutathione and then put the patch on, right?
[01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:02.060]   Correct.
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:05.780]   And then I mentioned that to you when I was trying to come up with my dime idea.
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:09.460]   And then you mentioned to me what you said that would, you tried it and it didn't work.
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:11.700]   I, I just kind of want to get that out there.
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:14.020]   So what was your experience with seffi dots?
[01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:25.380]   Well, the seffi dots work just fine, except that they will only last about three days.
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:28.580]   The frequency will dissipate.
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:29.580]   Just three days?
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:30.580]   Yes.
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:31.580]   Wow.
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:32.580]   Okay.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:33.580]   That's not a lot.
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:34.580]   And, and they tell you that.
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:35.580]   I mean, that's, you know, get another dot.
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:39.620]   And, you know, so they're, they're selling the little, they've got a little holograms.
[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:40.620]   Yeah.
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:42.420]   So you're going to burn through a lot of dots.
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:43.420]   Yeah.
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:49.860]   So you burn through the dots and, you know, put it in a magnet and it's just done.
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:50.860]   So okay.
[01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:54.980]   And again, this is, and this is something anybody can try.
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:57.980]   So, so inexpensive, you know, yeah.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:03.100]   So the idea simply is, is to, you know, you're still doing frequency medicine.
[01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:06.420]   You're taking it as frequency and water.
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:11.300]   And then for more, for acute, you know, if you're not acute, but for physical issues,
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:15.740]   you're going, then you'll just program a dot or, in your case, a little magnet that
[01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:19.980]   acts like a patch just like you would use with a life wave or you would use with cephy
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:20.980]   dots.
[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:23.020]   But instead you're using little circular magnets.
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.020]   Ah, brilliant.
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:25.020]   Okay.
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.020]   And it works.
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.020]   Right?
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:28.020]   Looking for you guys.
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:29.020]   There's a multiplication factor.
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:33.180]   I'm, I'm convinced of the magnet with the frequency.
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:34.180]   Yeah.
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:35.180]   There's.
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:36.180]   Don't ask me to explain it.
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:40.620]   You know, it's like, you know, when I was in high school, I took chemistry and, you
[01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:43.540]   know, it didn't like the class very much.
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:49.340]   And then I'm next thing I know of, I'm an adult when I'm building a radiation laboratory
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:51.100]   for major and radon gas.
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:57.180]   I don't know the stuff I just go out and work with it and see if it works.
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:20:02.780]   No, because it makes a lot of sense because you're combining, you know, magnet therapy,
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:07.820]   like North Pole magnet, that's very good for your body, then you're charging it in a block,
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:10.580]   which you added quantum energy to it.
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:14.420]   So you're putting a frequency in it's, you're doing some kind of like, you know, you know,
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:21.020]   a rifle or Holman kind of frequency treatment to your frequency medicine with quantum energy
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:25.580]   with bio magnetics, all combined in a little tiny little, you know, magnet.
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:26.580]   That's brilliant.
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:27.580]   Yeah.
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:28.580]   Cool.
[01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:29.580]   No, that's great.
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:30.580]   Oh, wow.
[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:31.580]   Okay.
[01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:32.580]   So those are, so you're getting really good results with that.
[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:33.580]   Great idea.
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:37.780]   If people want to like, let's say custom order, some little, you know, what do you call these
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:38.860]   magnets you create?
[01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:41.860]   Did you give it, did you give it a name like a product?
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:42.860]   No.
[01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:50.740]   Basically the product, you know, it's, it's a real basic one there on, on Amazon.
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:58.620]   Under, under our website, if you go over to beneficial products, okay.
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:02.980]   Where would that be under, under services member services.
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:03.980]   Oh, okay.
[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:07.980]   And you'll see it says beneficial products products.
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:08.980]   There you go.
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:09.980]   Oh, here.
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:10.980]   Okay.
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:11.980]   I totally missed this.
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:12.980]   Okay.
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:21.980]   So you've got the quantum pulse sessions, entanglement sessions, hydroxy sessions, ao scan, h2 library.
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:23.980]   I don't see it.
[01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:24.980]   Dot one.
[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:27.700]   You must have missed, you must have missed the beneficial.
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:29.980]   He got off onto something else to think.
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:30.980]   Okay.
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.980]   Here, beneficial.
[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:33.980]   Yeah.
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:34.980]   Or do I click on magnet?
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:35.980]   Oh.
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:36.980]   There you go.
[01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:38.980]   Oh, okay.
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:39.980]   Biomegnetics.
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:40.980]   So here you're selling the magnets.
[01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:41.980]   That was the one.
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:42.980]   Okay.
[01:21:42.980 --> 01:21:44.980]   Those are the end, end one magnets.
[01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:45.980]   Okay.
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:48.980]   And just different things that we've used.
[01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:49.980]   Oh, okay.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:56.980]   And, uh, there's, there's the link.
[01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:01.980]   Yeah, I don't see those lines.
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:08.980]   I don't have pictures, but the magnets are the acupressure patches just under the picture.
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:09.980]   Oh, these guys.
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:10.980]   Oh, I see.
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:11.980]   Okay.
[01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:14.980]   So if you go, if you click on that, that'll take you to the,
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:17.980]   should take you to the Amazon site.
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:19.980]   There's no link here.
[01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:22.980]   I know you just updated your wind.
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:26.980]   Wait a minute. Yeah, there's no link here. It's just a text.
[01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:28.980]   Uh, this is all news.
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:29.980]   I know. Yeah.
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:31.980]   You just updated your whole website a couple of weeks ago.
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:32.980]   So, okay.
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:33.980]   So, okay.
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:34.980]   So you're going to put a link here.
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.980]   So people are interested in getting magnetic acupressure.
[01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:39.980]   So if you just ordered off Amazon, obviously, it's blank.
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:40.980]   No quantum energy.
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:41.980]   No.
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:46.980]   So if you're like a cute block owner, you can just get the blank ones off Amazon.
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:51.980]   But if you don't want to go through that hassle, hey, there's rich and you'll make them for you.
[01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:52.980]   Right.
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:58.980]   I mean, yeah, it's, it's, uh, I wouldn't sell the product, but you will.
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:00.980]   Oh, okay.
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:01.980]   In print for you.
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:02.980]   Oh, so was that wrong?
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:04.980]   Cause I just said you, you, you make them for people.
[01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.980]   So you don't make them for people.
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:10.980]   If you, if you, if you have anything you want to charge will charge it for you.
[01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:11.980]   Okay.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:12.980]   Okay.
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:13.980]   Okay.
[01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:16.980]   So under here member services is all the list of stuff.
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:17.980]   Hello.
[01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:18.980]   Yeah, I can hear you.
[01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:19.980]   Can you hear me?
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:20.980]   Are you there?
[01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:21.980]   Yep.
[01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:23.980]   I can hear you.
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:25.980]   Can you hear me?
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:26.980]   Okay.
[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:29.980]   Yeah, I can hear you, but apparently you've lost.
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:31.980]   I can hear you now.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:32.980]   Okay.
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:33.980]   Great.
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:34.980]   You're back.
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:35.980]   Yeah, I could still hear you the whole time.
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:36.980]   Okay.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:37.980]   Okay.
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:38.980]   Okay.
[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.980]   So, um, you, you will help anybody.
[01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:43.980]   Oh, so if anybody's got any kind of question, just ask you, right?
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:44.980]   Yeah.
[01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:45.980]   All right.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:48.980]   Go, go, go, go fill out a contact form there.
[01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:51.980]   And if it takes me a little while, I'll get back to you.
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:54.980]   It's because I'm in the middle of the move.
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:55.980]   Okay.
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:56.980]   Cool.
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:58.980]   So how do you reach Richard?
[01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:03.980]   That's your website is the new image lifestyles.com.
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:05.980]   He's got a contact us for him.
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:08.980]   Just go ahead and if you want to reach out to him, you can go to the website.
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:15.980]   Take a look at all the different services and also not just services, but killer ideas guys.
[01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:19.980]   Cause if you have all of these gizmos, you know, uh, it's really fascinating.
[01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:23.980]   Richard, how you've learned how to combine them and tinker with them.
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:24.980]   So, all right.
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:32.980]   So I got you into bio magnetics and browns gas and you got me into bio photonic multi wave oscillators.
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:34.980]   We both joined C 60 at the same time.
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:37.980]   So I got to come up with something new to get you hooked on.
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.980]   All right.
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:41.980]   But this is great.
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:43.980]   You know, thank you so much for your time.
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:52.980]   I mean, any, any other like, uh, really good bio hacking advice or tips you'd like to share with folks for we, uh, wrap it up.
[01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:59.980]   Um, you know, my great, greatest advice is just, you know, don't be afraid of your body.
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:01.980]   Let your body talk to you.
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:04.980]   However, you can get it to talk to you.
[01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:13.980]   Um, and I guess I'll give you my, our number one go to therapy for coffee, animus.
[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:15.980]   Wow.
[01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:25.980]   All of the load on your liver is the biggest, is the biggest thing that you can do easy for two tablespoons of coffee.
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:26.980]   It's cheap.
[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:37.980]   And you'll never, you'll feel great and it'll get all the, get rid of the crap literally out of your liver that, uh, you know, it's basically Gerson therapy.
[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:38.980]   If he's read the garrison book.
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:39.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:40.980]   Garrison Miracle.
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:41.980]   That's an awesome book guys.
[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:42.980]   If you haven't read it.
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:45.980]   So Max Garrison is the guy's name.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:50.980]   Uh, 19th century doctor came up with this incredible modality that cures cancer.
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:51.980]   Um, so yeah.
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:57.980]   So yeah, so, you know, but the coffee, animus was part of his modality or his protocol.
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:01.980]   So how often do you recommend people do that for detoxing?
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:08.980]   Um, I started off doing them because my wife did them every day and I thought she was crazy.
[01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:10.980]   Um, every, every day.
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:11.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:12.980]   That's, that's all.
[01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:13.980]   Yeah.
[01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:18.980]   There's, there's a lot, but when you are sick.
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:23.980]   You know, it usually takes some kind of an episode.
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:31.980]   I, I got into some bad water and, and, uh, and E. coli and it shut down my kidneys.
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:39.980]   Just and I was like, I'm not going to go to the, to the, uh, hospital or, you know, go.
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:49.980]   And I went to, uh, went to our natural healing chiropractor at the time in Texas.
[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:56.980]   And you know, she diagnosed that it was, yep, your, your, your kidneys are shut down.
[01:26:56.980 --> 01:27:00.980]   So I got the, the, uh, Gerson book out and read it and started doing.
[01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:05.980]   I did, I think I did three a day, four a day for several weeks.
[01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:09.980]   And were you juicing at the same time?
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:11.980]   Uh, doing juicing.
[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:14.980]   So juicing and, and Gerson.
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.980]   So you did the full gear or something.
[01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:17.980]   Okay.
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:22.980]   You know, and yeah, it just works.
[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:23.980]   Awesome.
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:24.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:26.980]   So, you know, that's always been on the radar for me.
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:28.980]   I just never, ever got around to do.
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:32.980]   It's one of those other that actually own the equipment to do it.
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:33.980]   I just put it on a shelf.
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:36.980]   And I added it to my collection.
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:38.980]   I don't know why.
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:39.980]   I just haven't done it.
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:42.980]   There's such a, there's such a resistance to doing it.
[01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:47.980]   You know, it's, you know, it's, you know, it's messy.
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:50.980]   You know, you just know, people don't want to mess with their behinds.
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:54.980]   You know, it's just like, it's like the, it's like people who are into urine therapy.
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:59.980]   And I just, it grosses me out, but there's science and there's really smart people.
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:02.980]   Like Amanda Volter, you know, that I just respect.
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:04.980]   And she's a proponent for it.
[01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:10.980]   And I'm like, oh, but still, you know, but still, no, no, just just no.
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:11.980]   Yeah.
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:13.980]   It's like there's just certain things you just know.
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:16.980]   I'm a biohacker, but I have boundaries.
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:20.980]   And you want to take your coffee with cream and sugar.
[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:22.980]   And yeah, and I just, yeah, that's not where I put coffee.
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:27.980]   But, but I did, but I do tell you though, speaking of livers.
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:30.980]   I ran across a new herb that I, not a new one.
[01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:33.980]   It's been around forever, but it clips a parata.
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:36.980]   That's really good for liver support.
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:38.980]   Plus I was taking a peptide.
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:43.980]   So I went through this, you know, regimen of just doing a clips of parata.
[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:46.980]   And I forget the name of that specific peptide.
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:51.980]   And I did that for like six months and it really just kind of was the focus was, you know, support the liver.
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:57.980]   And now I'm focused on kidneys and I just kind of rotate through my, my organs.
[01:28:57.980 --> 01:29:00.980]   So yeah, I'm always trying to do stuff like that.
[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:06.980]   But yeah, yeah, you know, there's certain things where anybody wants to be encouraged or learn about it.
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.980]   Dr. Lawrence Wilson.
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:13.980]   Dr. Lawrence Wilson Wilson Wilson Wilson.
[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:20.980]   He's got a phenomenal website about, you know, the whole area of coffee.
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:24.980]   And this tells you exactly how to do it, what the benefits are.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:32.980]   Just just a remarkable read that, you know, you'll find very encouraging.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:33.980]   Okay.
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:37.980]   Well, if you're saying it's awesome, then it's got to be awesome.
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:38.980]   Here you go.
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:42.980]   Coffee energy by Dr. Lawrence Wilson. Okay. Yeah.
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:49.980]   And I know that from the, from Dave Asprey, you know, he's really adamant about getting organic toxin mold free.
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:52.980]   And so I think that's probably real important to you, right?
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:58.980]   It's not just go down to, you know, you pigly wiggly and buy some coffee and then, you know, bend over.
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:29:59.980]   Exactly.
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:00.980]   It's a lot more than that.
[01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:03.980]   So it's so heavily, you know, sprayed.
[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:08.980]   Oh, yeah, I mean, coffee, I think it was, it's coffee and nuts, right?
[01:30:08.980 --> 01:30:15.980]   Are they one of the two most toxic things that we ingest every day because of just the mold that grows on these beans.
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:16.980]   Right.
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:20.980]   Before, you know, before processing, it's just mitotoxins, really bad stuff.
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:26.980]   So not to drag things out, but another therapy we used is ozone.
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:28.980]   Can you do ozone too? Okay.
[01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:38.980]   You can do, you can do a $650, $60 ozone machine and just put your coffee beans, any coffee beans.
[01:30:38.980 --> 01:30:48.980]   Actually, you put them down into the sink and then bubble, bubble that with ozone, right, you know, the water and, and then dry them in the oven.
[01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:51.980]   And, and you can clean them up real well with ozone.
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:58.980]   Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've got a kitchen ozone generator. I've got one for, like, just air, you know, like, just clear out the air.
[01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:06.980]   I've got another ozone generator that's like my medical grade for drinking ozone water when I do a Bob Bennett protocol.
[01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:10.980]   Um, yeah, yeah, I've got three different generators.
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:12.980]   I love ozone. I'm big on ozone.
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:14.980]   Really big on the gas therapy in general.
[01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:15.980]   Yep.
[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:21.980]   It's amazing how parallel our lives are. And a lot of people listening to this are on the exact same path.
[01:31:21.980 --> 01:31:22.980]   Yes.
[01:31:22.980 --> 01:31:29.980]   So to wrap this up, everyone listening, I hope this was entertaining and educational and hope you got some great ideas.
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:32.980]   Um, and thanks for rich so much for your time today.
