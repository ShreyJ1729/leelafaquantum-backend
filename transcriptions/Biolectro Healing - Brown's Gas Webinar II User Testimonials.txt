[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   All right, hello, everyone, and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.720]   I'm your host, Kay Alber, and you are watching a Brown's Gas Webinar as part of the Bioelectric
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.720]   Healing Series.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.800]   We've got Ben from H2 Biohacker on the line.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.280]   We've got several other folks that have joined the webinar.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.560]   We've got Mandy and Pete and Lorne.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.120]   Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.520]   We're going to be chatting about Brown's Gas.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.280]   And first, before we jump right into that, let me just do a quick disclaimer.

[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.400]   Hey, did I do that fast enough?
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.760]   Because you know, I've been practicing that for like three years.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.240]   Very good.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.240]   Welcome.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.240]   Welcome, everyone else.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.600]   This is a chat about Brown's Gas, and you know, the last one we had last month, we were
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.440]   really kind of getting into some of the, and I think this is where the rubber really hits
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.440]   the road, right?
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.280]   It's like, what are people saying?
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.640]   Because there's no actual Brown's Gas studies yet, because everybody is usually studying
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.200]   just hydrogen, right?
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.960]   But the actual experience of people using Brown's Gas is something that's coming out
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.320]   as, as primarily user experiences until such time that scientists will actually dedicate
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.320]   in it.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.560]   And you know, a focus purely on Brown's Gas as opposed to hydrogen.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.160]   But we didn't really even get a chance to get like really deep into it.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   So I kind of wanted to just, you know, have another webinar.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.880]   Just talk about some of the testimonials.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.760]   But Lorne, I do know that you've got to take off a little early.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.840]   So maybe we'll kind of like, you know, just kind of like one of the things that was interesting
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.000]   and Lorne's going to kind of, I invited him to kind of chat about his experience is about
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.040]   using Brown's Gas and CPAP machines, right?
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.320]   So if anyone remembers, or if you had a chance to watch the prior webinar, basically I'd
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.680]   ask that question and Ben, your position on that was not a good idea for some reasons.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.040]   And then of course there's always somebody else that's going to do it.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.640]   Someone's always going to push it.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.320]   Yeah, that's the beauty of the tinker, you know, I agree with that.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.600]   And you know, so you've got a tinker.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.640]   And so of course, Lorne does it.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.520]   And so, you know, so I guess let's talk about start with like Brown's Gas as part of your
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.840]   CPAP machine.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.600]   So first, if we can do a short recap on Ben, you know, why do you think it's a bad idea?
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.640]   And then Lorne, what happened when you did it?
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.000]   And then, you know, let's, let's, I just because I want to hear, you know, like, what's
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.040]   so let Ben, why don't you start in, let's just chat about doing that because, you know,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.560]   I think it's the base idea of the premise is that you don't want a super high concentration
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.320]   of hydrogen anywhere that's going to reach a flammable level.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.360]   So when in the CPAP machines, depending on how it's configured, if you're breathing in
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.360]   and exhaling into the same mask, for instance, you're just constantly in the hydrogen.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.680]   So you, it's, there's more of a risk there of say a spark.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.080]   If there wasn't such a spark, it could, you know, pop or at night.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.960]   So that's the only thing you've got to keep in mind when using hydrogen.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.600]   Normally when you breathe through a cannula, it quickly diffuses into air.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.680]   So the idea is that you're getting, you know, below or somewhere around a 4% quantity or
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.840]   by volume and air of hydrogen, you know, in the, in the air in the mixture breathing.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.000]   So that's the idea and premise behind this.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Okay.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Um, so it's that whole keep it under 4% of total like, you know, gas, you know, air plus
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.600]   hydrogen so that you don't get flammable, right?
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   Right.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.340]   Around 4% of hydrogen by volume in there.
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.680]   So loan, how did you hook it up?
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.680]   Yes.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.340]   So just explain like, like, how did you hook it up and was there an accumulation?
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.720]   Or there's not an accumulation because what I was doing is I was putting it in through
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.440]   the vent that was drawing the air into the CPAP machine and the CPAP machine creates
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.760]   about what my personal setting was between seven and 11 atmospheres.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   So you're constantly getting about seven to 11 atmospheres being pressed into your nose
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:40.980]   and it's bent it out through a vent on your mask and that bent is constantly flowing.
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.380]   So you're never getting a concentration of the browns gas because with my particular
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:53.960]   machine, which is nearly as safe as bins or Georges, I was getting too high of a concentration
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.520]   just directly put it in my nose.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.040]   So if I put it in through the CPAP machine, it would, it was getting drawn in with about
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.000]   seven atmospheres of air all the time, went through an additional humidifier inside of
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.840]   the CPAP machine and then given to me and I, I used that for probably 11 of the last
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.360]   12 months until I got a little bit concerned about some of the sounds I hadn't went out
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.560]   of my browns gas machine.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.720]   Okay.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.440]   So Ben, what do you think of that?
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.760]   Because it sounds like it's just like a one way street, right?
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.000]   It comes in the vent into the lungs out the gap, out the mask.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.160]   I mean, if it's mixed with enough air initially and then it's all expelled, I mean, like I
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.800]   said, it depends on how the machine is configured, you know, there's a good way in that way to
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.800]   do it, you know, or a safe way in a nonsense, not so safe way to do it.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.460]   But it sounds like what loan is doing, it's not that bad.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.800]   So what I want to hear from loan is like, so when your experience is general, my sister's
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:01.720]   got one, yeah, so what the CPAP does is it's constantly pushing air in there so that it
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.320]   can maintain a atmospheric pressure of like seven times to 11 times for my particular
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.320]   machine.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:16.200]   But it can be good out as much as two to, I think, 14 as far as the pressures, but there's
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:23.560]   always adding pressure to enable you to breathe without your airways getting clogged up.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.880]   And because of that, you constantly have a fresh supply of air.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:36.120]   So what I was getting was problems gas diluted by at least two atmospheres and probably at
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.360]   least seven atmospheres from my particular settings.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.640]   And that's far more than if I was just breathing it directly from a cannula.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.040]   And that's being blown in there all the time.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.440]   And so you are breathing what's the air that's passing through in that moment, but it's not
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.440]   building up.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.840]   That doesn't happen in any seat of that machine.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   Okay.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.840]   Right.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.240]   So the bottom line to what effects did you notice when we were here to talk about testimonials
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.000]   in brown gas and how it looks in people's toe?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.200]   It was fantastic.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.200]   I had a lot of dreams.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:18.240]   I was dreaming too much and have to turn off the browns gas machine at night.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.200]   And so that was probably five out of seven nights that I would do that.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.040]   I had excellent sleep.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   I had a great effect on my skin, it had a great effect on my eyesight.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:46.080]   And I think taking it in combination with C60, it really had a great protective effect
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.080]   for me.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:54.280]   I didn't experience any, I've been sick all year, except for a couple of headaches when
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.560]   I think I might have had the coronavirus.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.560]   Wow.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:03.560]   So, so you could, you could definitely tell a distinct difference between, you know, like
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.640]   a before and after, you know, using this CPAP and all of a sudden you connect browns
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.240]   gas to it and you actually could absolute difference.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.920]   There was a chance positive change for the better with browns gas as opposed to just running
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.480]   the CPAP by itself.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.480]   Very much.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.480]   And I very much miss it.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:28.460]   It's been three or four weeks since I've been comfortable running machine in my bedroom.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.880]   And I do miss it and my sleep quality isn't as good.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.560]   And I don't have the dreams that I used to have.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.560]   Wow.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.560]   Great.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:44.480]   I know dreams, dreams and mental, increased mental activity mean in a good way or like
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.600]   the number one, first effect that people mention and notice.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.040]   So that's, and it seems to be what's happening.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.560]   I mean, I'm just as, you know, in part theory or based on some research, but my own, you
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:04.560]   know, guessing as well is that the hydrogen, it quickly passes the blood brain barrier
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.000]   and gets in there.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.600]   And there's research to show that the mitochondria may be able to directly utilize hydrogen.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.840]   And so it just, it activates your mind, but what's interesting at the same time, it enables
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.000]   you to sleep.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.840]   So your body can sleep as it normally would.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:26.600]   It's not like a caffeine stimulant to just keep you awake, but your body can, what's interesting,
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.120]   you can go to sleep and get good sleep, but at the same time, your mind is more active.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.960]   And that's why it seems like you can fall asleep, but your dream activity and the clarity
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.640]   of your dreams and the lucidity of your dreams increases.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.600]   So it seems like that's the way the body is normally made for that type of environment
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:49.720]   in the, the hydrogen of the browns gas enhances that whole, you know, to make your whole system
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:55.040]   work more efficiently, sleep better in more active dreams and night.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.400]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.880]   So I'm, so I'm just curious, it's like, how many were you, did you ever measure like how
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.200]   much browns gas you were pumping into the vent?
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.600]   You know, cause the machine can be throttled up or down.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:19.840]   So my, my machine had a zero, had only one setting and that was on and you taught me
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:27.100]   how to do a kind of a fill with some fill jar with water and the bottles gas.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:33.360]   And I was getting about 800 liters per minute.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:42.040]   And so it had a pretty good output in the entire than what they're recommending as far
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.600]   as we can put directly in here in your nose.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.160]   Okay.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:55.800]   And did your sleep apnea, was there any difference in the, in your, you know, your apnea issue?
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:01.280]   Cause you know, yeah, the CBAP machine actually measures that and I've had fantastic numbers
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.280]   all year long.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.920]   So it measures it by the number of interruptions per hour.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:13.920]   And I'm typically at, you know, seven to 11.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:19.240]   And while I was using it, I was down to a point nine to 1.1.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.920]   So it definitely helps that.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.320]   That's just the CBAP or that was with browns gas.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.320]   The browns gas did that.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.480]   No, that's with browns gas.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:32.240]   Now, now that I don't have it, it's gone back up to about a five.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.240]   Okay.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:38.240]   So there is no wrong improvement in me, but you know, I did put on a lot of weight last
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.240]   year and I, it didn't get worse.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.960]   So you and everybody else.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.480]   I'm with you.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.760]   Like the old lockdown in charade, uh, but well, okay.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:58.080]   So you actually dropped from seven to 11 incidences per hour down to zero, yeah, browns gas.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.200]   And then when you took the browns gas off, you went back up again.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.280]   Went back up to about five and getting a solid five every night right now.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.280]   I miss it.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.680]   I'm going to have to build a glass shield or buy one of Ben's.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:18.920]   Hey, um, hey, Ben, there's an idea, build a CBAP attachment to the H, H2 Genesis.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.720]   Yeah, that's something we can look into.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.720]   Think about that.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.360]   I mean, you know, like we've got some of the, if you look at some of the first world problems
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:34.400]   and most pronounced first world problems, obviously one of them is sleep apnea.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.120]   And you know, and that's amazing.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.880]   That's an amazing testimony loan.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.880]   Wow.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.120]   Thank you so much for sharing that.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.400]   Does anyone have a question for loan before you ask to drop off?
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.560]   I, we got a couple other folks just unmute yourself.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:54.520]   If you have a question and okay, Ben, did you have any other, any, any other thoughts
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.320]   or questions for a loan?
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.360]   Um, not right now, but I'm definitely interested in them.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.520]   I would like to follow up with them apart from here and so you can get some more details
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.280]   and work something out for them to get them a machine that works, right?
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.280]   There we go.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.280]   Absolutely.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.280]   Hey, thank you guys very much.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.280]   It's been fantastic.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.280]   Okay.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.280]   All right, guy, you take care.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.280]   Catch you in the kitchen.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:20.140]   Um, you know, we have a brown for anyone listening to the video later.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:26.540]   We have a browns gas hydrogen, uh, telegram chat group where we basically talk a lot about
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.080]   browns gas, mostly and molecular hydrogen as well.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.000]   Most recently we kind of got into, uh, instead of H HO and H2, we're starting to, starting
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.720]   to talk a lot about H2O, uh, water, structuring water, bubbling water, uh, and then ozone every
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   now and then.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.040]   So it's kind of really kind of a real interesting chat group about how, uh, you can apply
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.960]   some of these technologies and some of these substances to improve your health.
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.520]   So that's where we met alone and, wow, that was really cool.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.120]   So hey, I'm going to turn it back to you, uh, Ben, about, you know, let's chat about
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.760]   some of those testimonials we didn't get to hear about in the first webinar.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.760]   Um, I'm going to go through some of the quicker ones first, um, some of them, my own, you
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.920]   know, let's, you know, I talk about from the horse's mouth, um, and I'll save some of
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.240]   the longer and more detail ones later, but, um, we can jump around.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:18.120]   But, um, to follow up on what I mentioned before, um, my shoulder, I've got like, well, I had,
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.040]   I can say it now, um, would I consider frozen, frozen shoulder or a pinch man or a rotator
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.440]   cuff problem could have been torn.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.080]   I mean, it was pretty bad for a while.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.560]   I couldn't raise my shoulder or my arm at all above my head and it was just in almost
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.320]   nonstop pain for, for a certain time, like, you know, I delayed treating with brown gas
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.720]   because I was at the time I was working on a, a PMF device, you know, coil, post-electro-magnetic
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:46.760]   frequency device, as well as I wanted to try, um, um, on infrared light therapy.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:53.520]   And so, um, I delayed my, my oxygen, hydrogen, hydrogen treatments on that to, you know,
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.320]   to work through these other, um, treatments to see if they work.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:02.680]   So anyways, um, I did find that the infrared and the, the pulse of electromagnetic worked.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.120]   But, um, and so I did that for a month or two and it started getting better.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:14.360]   But once I made, um, a sleeve, it's kind of like a, a cylinder that, um, has a drawstring
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.080]   kind of, uh, you know, attachment on both sides.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.320]   So you would slip up over your elbow, your knee or onto your shoulder, shoulder, pull
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.600]   the drawstring on both sides and close it up.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.960]   You insert a tube with a hose where the brown gas is coming out of that would go into there
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.280]   and it would fill up and it would be hydrogen or the gas, it would diffuse through your
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.120]   skin to, for a treatment.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:41.680]   Um, we've treated so many, um, hand, foot, elbow, knee, shoulder injuries like this and
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.320]   the results have been incredible.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:49.040]   So anyways, um, my shoulder was gradually getting better, but not in a stellar improvements.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:55.280]   And but I did notice also large effects by just, um, attaching the, the gas hose to, uh,
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:02.160]   silicone like funnel and that would be more, you know, um, direct or very localized, not
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.680]   as much as like say, bagging area would be.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.640]   Um, so I noticed that, um, okay, on the top, if I put on my top of the shoulder, the front
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.240]   of the shoulder back, that area would feel much better, you know, no pains or less knots,
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.920]   but I couldn't easily just move that around and didn't do it justice.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:22.080]   But once I got the sleeve I made and was able to treat the whole thing without it, you know,
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.280]   the bag or whatever falling off or, you know, and once it became more easy to use in that
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:34.080]   way, in that degree, um, I went from being maybe 50% feeling better to nearly like I'm
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:39.360]   like about, and after just three treatments overnight, say one night, wait a few days,
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.200]   do it again, you know, overnight or a few hours, I mean, it fall off after a few hours,
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.440]   but I probably got a good, you know, three, four, five hours in, um, with the sleeve
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.440]   on my shoulder.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:55.360]   So just three treatments and it's near 98, 99% I can, I'd have to move my shoulder around
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:02.720]   to really feel a stiff part now, it's kind of hard to find, um, but so I waited months,
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:07.320]   you know, and pain and kind of being a little bit debilitated with my movement and what
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:12.880]   I can do to in no time being able to use it and don't even think about it anymore.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.880]   Yeah, I remember.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.880]   And that was just up there.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.880]   Three solid treatments.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:21.280]   I know you were talking all last year about PMF to free your shoulder because you'd tread
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.280]   everything else.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.960]   Hey, what is this, like, can you show what the sleeve looks like?
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.860]   Cause I'm trying to picture in my head what you could use for your shoulder, right?
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.200]   Because your shoulder, you can bag, right?
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.400]   I mean, you know, and then it's not like you're not cupping in your, I don't know if you
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.400]   had a picture of that thing, but that would be really interesting.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.840]   Yeah, I'll see if I can send you one, um, and maybe you can put up, um, okay, I'll
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.840]   play a stove.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.120]   Um, if you've got anything else to say, while I'm sending that to you.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.120]   A few other testimonies.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.480]   Well, I know that, I know that Mandy you've tried topical, right?
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.120]   And I've tried topical, so I'll go first.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:06.720]   Um, I, uh, last year I had, uh, really bad, I was cooking and I got some hot oil on, on
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:12.400]   my right arm and it was, it was like multiple patches anywhere from, uh, you know, a small
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:17.960]   dot to, you know, as big as a dime and it was three, third degree burns, right?
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.240]   And of course it hurt like hell.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.400]   And so my first thought was, uh, was to bag it, you know, I mean, I, I just washed it off
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.800]   and, and it was just hurting and I thought, well, you know, I've got my browns gas thing
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.440]   and I wanted to play with it anyway.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:37.560]   So I bagged my arm and basically pumped, uh, browns gas into the bag where my, my burns
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.560]   were.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.440]   And, uh, what was, what I found amazing was that the pain went away like within a, like
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.240]   I'd say maybe 10, 20 minutes, the pain was gone.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:53.280]   And the most interesting part about, uh, using browns gas to treat burn was that the pain
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.000]   never came back.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.120]   It never hurt again after that.
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.880]   It was just the weirdest thing where, you know, normally it hurts like hell right the
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.480]   next day because I usually just put it like, uh, burn gel, you know, get that burn gel
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.240]   at the, but instead I bagged it.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.720]   So, uh, now what I did notice was I, I just bagged it the one time because once the pain
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.280]   went away, I just was trying to keep it clean.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:18.080]   Uh, it, so I didn't notice that it like healed faster, but the main thing was the pain was
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.080]   gone.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.760]   And I, I found that to be pretty amazing.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.800]   Um, and so I, you know, I don't know why I didn't think about one and I tried bagging
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.120]   it for two, three days in a row to see if it healed faster for I just got busy, right?
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.120]   But, uh, but that was my one time that I tried bagging.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:38.160]   I have tried bagging my legs, uh, because I have a bum knee and I just, I didn't get
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.360]   it, I didn't feel like, I like an improvement and it could be where, you know, the leg sleeve
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.760]   right now, the leg bag goes all the way up to your thigh and I couldn't isolate it, maybe
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.680]   get enough pressure right on my knee.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.160]   Now what you're describing is giving me the idea of, well, maybe I could make a sleeve
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:00.800]   just for my knee kind of thing, uh, and you can, um, I'm hoping that these sleeves up on
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.800]   our website soon.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.360]   They're not right now, but if anyone is in a rush to get one, they can email me directly
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.480]   or contact us in the telegram group and we can arrange to get one quicker and, um, I know
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.360]   we're sending a, I'm a, I'm a new machine to you, um, K, uh, pretty soon.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.240]   So, um, we can include that as well.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.240]   So you can do a try.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.240]   I wanted to do an unboxing.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.320]   So Mandy, you tried, you tried topical, right?
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.320]   Didn't you try to bag something?
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.320]   I did.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.820]   I bagged my leg.
[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:34.960]   Um, I've got, but also a knee issue and, um, interestingly enough, I got acupuncture,
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:42.240]   several months ago, and one of the spots where one of the needles went is still sore.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:49.480]   I'm not sure what that's about, um, and also on Morton's neuroma, all on my right leg and
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.480]   foot.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.720]   So I thought I'm just gonna bag my whole leg and see what happens.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.600]   Um, and it did alleviate a lot of the pain.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.800]   Nothing happened with my knee.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.760]   I mean, it just, it felt better for a while.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:09.000]   But, um, I only tried it the one time because things got a little busy in life, but I definitely
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.200]   intend to, to do this again, um, with a kind of bigger bag because the bag I had was kind
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.640]   of small and it just went right up to my knee.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:25.920]   So, um, the results were enough that I was like that, that seemed to do something.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.560]   I, I definitely want to try it again with a bigger bag that goes a little bit farther
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.560]   up my leg, um, to really get my knee in there as well.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.560]   So cool.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.880]   So, so Ben, does your sleeve, like you can just isolate like a, a joint, basically, like
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:46.240]   if I just want to treat my knee because with the full right back, your, your foot's in
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.240]   there in there.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.240]   I mean, you'd see.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.240]   So I, it takes a lot.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.240]   I just sent you a picture.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.240]   Okay.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.240]   You should have a picture and tell them if you want to find it and pull it up.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.080]   Um, meanwhile, I go into a few other things to mention about what were, since one of the
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:04.360]   topics of bagging or external use, um, what I noticed, um, I used to have some small
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:09.200]   little warts on my hands that, I mean, they either cut them off, burn them off and they,
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.200]   they'd come back.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.760]   I mean, eventually they would just come back.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.080]   Um, the last time I did this, what, what, what kind of works to help get them started
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.080]   to come off.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.680]   I mean, there's a, you know, small, but they're a pain.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.920]   They, they start to, you know, get big after a little while.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.080]   I see you just put up the, um, the sleeve.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.280]   So let me jump to this for a quick while you get it up.
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:31.620]   But you can see there's like a, a drawstring type, um, you know, string going through with
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.140]   a little lock on it.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:39.280]   So you'd slide that up to your elbow, your knee, or that I use this on my shoulder.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:45.760]   And so it was enough to close in both sides and maintain it there with enough pressure.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:52.000]   So that, um, the hose with the gas coming out would just be pumped right into it.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.100]   And that seemed to be enough to get the, the gas to surround the shoulder and make things
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.100]   better.
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.800]   Well, what kind of material is that?
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:06.640]   Just go right through it or, right, um, you cannot, if you put it up to your mouth and
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.960]   blow, try to blow through it.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.400]   You cannot blow through it.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:15.560]   It's almost, it's very thin in a flexible material like you can kind of see in the picture,
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:21.880]   it wrinkles, but they use this material on beds and to prevent, you know, mites and bugs
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.760]   from getting into the mattress or, um, it's waterproof as well.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.120]   So they use it in some cases for our mattress covers, you know, to make waterproof mattress
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.520]   covers, use it in hospitals as well.
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:36.840]   Um, so that's, that's the idea with this material that the gas cannot easily escape.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:43.480]   Um, where it's sewed in the seams, um, the gas can escape, but it's not, not a whole
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.480]   lot.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   It does not blow up.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.960]   Uh, this, this particular version did not puff up like a balloon, but it was enough
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.000]   to keep the gas in there to make a significant difference.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.160]   Um, another test I'm doing right now is, um, using a little bit of silicone to help seal
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.360]   it even better, but it's, that's not really necessary.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:05.240]   The idea is if you've got enough gas that's, um, maintained in the immediate air or environment
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:10.160]   around the joint, it seems that the hydrogen and gases, um, diffuse into your skin enough
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.160]   to make a change.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.160]   Okay.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.800]   And that, that's the bag that you used on your shoulder.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.800]   Correct.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   This exact bag.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   Okay.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:22.840]   Could you pump the, um, the gas in like a full throttle or half throttle?
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.440]   Um, I recommend, uh, maybe somewhere around 80%.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.360]   I don't like to run our machines at a hundred percent.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:33.760]   It just heats up too much and the water evaporates really quickly and this will, you get a lot
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.160]   of water vapor in it.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.560]   So, um, you know, I don't recommend breathing any more than 40% power right now with our
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.800]   machines, but around 80% for external use is fine.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:48.440]   So the watch, you know, the water will still last a while, but it does get used up a lot
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.440]   more quickly.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:55.840]   Um, but yeah, I'm much higher, uh, gas output than you would use if you were inhaling or
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:56.840]   even bubbling.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.840]   So I like that.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.840]   You're 80%.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:07.880]   So you've got new people on the cannulas though, then you can crank it up to 60 to 80% right?
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:08.880]   Right.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.880]   Right.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:14.080]   Like, uh, you know, an hour at most, but, um, after an hour, 80% it starts to heat up.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:19.000]   I mean, you can still do it, but I mean, to be really safe, I mean, I like to say, you
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.200]   know, no more than an hour at that with, you know, say two or three people connected
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:28.880]   because, um, some people start to notice that the, um, the gas, um, is a little bit warmer
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:34.000]   or hotter and that may not have to be as comfortable to breathe over a longer period
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   of time.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.800]   Um, and in the range of 20 to 30%, I mean, I, I can breathe all night.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:44.220]   And the gas feels nice and cool still, you know, the, the fan in the machine keeps it
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.220]   really cool.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:49.720]   So it doesn't heat overheat to, to affect the quality or temperature of the gas coming
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   out.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   Okay.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.720]   Thanks.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.120]   You know, that's, it's interesting that because, you know, the plastic, you know, like when
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:04.800]   you use a bag, uh, it just gets really humid and wet and sweaty and so the thing is because
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.800]   it can breathe.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.600]   It doesn't get, you don't get wet.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.600]   Right.
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.600]   I noticed the same thing.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.440]   When I used a plastic bag, when I spray my foot and it, it swole up and I couldn't walk,
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.120]   I put it on a bag overnight and, uh, it did sweat in there, but I also did have the machine
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.640]   on a higher power, but this little sleeve I have here, it can breathe more easily.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:30.480]   So it did not sweat or condense any, um, gases or vapors into liquid.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.480]   Okay.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.920]   Well, I definitely want to try this.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.520]   So you're going to have these available for sale on your life then, um, yes, and I'll
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.080]   see if we can get one made, if you're interested, um, you said for your knee.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:46.680]   So when we send it out, hopefully this week later, awesome, you'll give us some feedback.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.680]   It's going to be great.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.040]   They get some feedback on you from, yeah, see how it works for you.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.040]   Got to get one demand.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.040]   Right.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.040]   Well, she needs a whole leg one possibly.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.960]   Oh, you need a whole leg, right?
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.880]   Well, I mean, we can do like a special orders because my mother sows and she's going to
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.600]   be the one probably making most of these, um, you know, to order, um, we can make, we're
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.640]   probably like a hand size or foot sizes, you know, one size fits all, but depending on
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.960]   the size of your elbow, knee and shoulder, um, if it's a young kid or a child, they're
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:24.560]   going to have a much smaller, you know, diameter or circumference joint than an older person
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.560]   would have.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.560]   Right.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.560]   So we may have to adjust some of the sizes, you know, to, to something like the sleeve right
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.560]   here.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.560]   Right.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:38.240]   You know, bagging, bagging is definitely the way to go for some problems for sure.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:42.240]   I've got some more testimonials to that, um, effective shortly as well.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.240]   You go into it.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:48.560]   That's the best way to treat, um, things on your face or head or that area because obviously
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:54.160]   Kate bagged your head, um, I, that's a good question.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.160]   I haven't had to do that myself yet or I don't know anyone that's done yet.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.600]   So that's like unexplored terrace or hit this point.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:06.400]   The only thing I've tried so far is, um, I had a sty on my eye and I just took the one
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:12.240]   of the nasal cannulas and I put the little, um, the little holes right up, right below
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:22.280]   my eyelid and let it go for, I don't know, and maybe half an hour or so and it really
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.960]   did help it heal faster.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.960]   Right.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.960]   Right.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.960]   Does that make sense?
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:31.960]   Um, let me get back to the, the warts and then I get a few other things I want to mention
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.480]   seriously and get through some of these more testimonials quick.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.640]   So, um, anyway, what I found with warts, I'm cutting a small piece of garlic and taping
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:45.640]   it on the wort with some duct tape, um, that works that'll, that'll, it's, it's sometimes
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.160]   it stings if it really gets in there, but then after a week or so, it'll start to dry
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.400]   out and a layer will peel off.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:57.320]   And um, if you put another piece of garlic on the, on the wort to go deeper and to get
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.400]   the roots out, it really starts to sting.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:07.160]   So it's almost difficult to get the whole, um, the, get the roots to get the virus out,
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.920]   which causes a wort.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:13.000]   Um, so in my case, they'd always come back, you know, five, six, seven times either once
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.280]   a year and they still eventually, you know, grow back.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:20.760]   But this last time I did it, um, I got the first layer off of the garlic and in the roots
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.880]   turned black so you can see there's something still in there.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.680]   And um, I said, oh, I'll, I'll do it again.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.080]   I'll, I'll just deal with the pain or whatever.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:33.120]   And, um, before I knew it, um, you know, I was doing a bunch of the browns gas, you
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:37.600]   know, breathing more than anything and they, they're even the roots.
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.600]   It just went away.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.600]   There's no sign of any of these.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.520]   I had like six small ones on my fingers and they're all gone now.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.080]   This is the first time ever that they've completely gone.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:50.480]   And I heard from someone else that they had a similar problem with, uh, one, with warts
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.160]   on their hands and that that's one of the, um, things that they had mentioned, the, the
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.360]   warts had gone away.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.760]   But this is also something that seems to happen over time.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:05.680]   It seems like your immune system really has to, um, build up or get stronger to fight
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.760]   off the viruses that caused the warts.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.960]   It's not something that goes away right away.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:16.040]   Um, cause I just noticed this in the last couple of months and I've been using the browns
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:21.720]   gas for, um, over a year now and I was wondering if and when they would ever go away.
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.120]   So it did take a while, but they did go away, you know, naturally.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.520]   And how were you, um, you were cupping it or bagging, you're like bagging.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.800]   No, I was just, I was just breathing.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.320]   I wasn't even bagging my hands.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.240]   That's probably why I took longer for them to go away.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.680]   Um, cause it's not super convenient unless you've got a really painful issue or issue
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.240]   with your, one of you joints that you, um, want to heal right away.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.160]   I mean, the warts weren't a really a problem.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.280]   You know, they, it wasn't, it wasn't worth bagging my hands and being in convenience
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.840]   like that all the time.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.760]   So that's why it takes a long to go away.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.840]   You can still heal a lot of the, the extremity issues like that just by breathing, but it's
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:31:00.040]   just going to take longer, you know, breathing and drinking the water pops, as well as both.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.040]   Okay.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:06.000]   But, um, because the hydrogen you breathe in or drinking doesn't get to, so your extremities,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.320]   like your fingers and knuckles and some of your joints, um, not as easily as if you're
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:16.600]   diffused to through your skin, I'm drinking and breathing will take longer to affect those,
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.360]   uh, problem areas.
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.360]   Okay.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:25.400]   Um, and so, um, so that was that I noticed, um, but getting back to the, the stings and
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:31.960]   burns, um, I've noticed that as well, my son, my son was, um, burned his finger, blister,
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:35.640]   pain, you know, 10 minutes bagging it, pain goes away.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:40.720]   So he was like normal, but once the pain is gone, um, you kind of like, don't worry
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   about it.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.440]   Let it heal on its own, you know, it may heal faster if you continue to bag it or treat
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.440]   it.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:50.560]   But if it's, if it's not bothering, there's no pain, just let it heal as it would naturally.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:54.440]   Um, b-bites, um, stings as well.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.520]   But another interesting testimony that came up just a few days ago is, um, where I am
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.520]   there, there's scorpions.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.520]   You know, sometimes we get them in the houses and every now and then someone gets bit, um,
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:11.240]   one of, um, uh, workers here, he, um, he got bit and he's, uh, it's one of the most painful
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:14.960]   bites you can get and it doesn't just last for a few hours, like I say, a big bee sting
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.280]   would last for some people, depending on how they react to it.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:19.280]   It could last days.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.280]   You know, the pain.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.880]   Um, and so I, I'm talking to one of, um, our clients have, this Paul, one of our issue
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:30.400]   genesis machines and he's like, um, I get a message from him and he's like, yeah, so
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.120]   it's the message was, it wasn't talking about it.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.440]   He's like, Ben, do you think it'll work on a scorpion bite?
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.440]   He just got bit by scorpion.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:40.640]   I said, I mean, it should give it a try, you know, try to bag it up in, um, by the time
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:45.600]   he got my message and responded, he's like, I breathe, I just breathe it for an hour in
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.600]   all the pain went away.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.040]   So he didn't even get a chance to bag it.
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:51.920]   He just sat down and breathe for an hour and all the pain went away.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.200]   So I'm like, wow, that's pretty good because the last person I know they got bit by a scorpion.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.800]   The pain lasted, you know, days.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.880]   But if he, if he would have bagged it, I could almost guarantee that the pain would have
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.320]   went away much sooner, but I was impressed with it going away within an hour.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.320]   Wow.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.320]   Okay.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.320]   Wow.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.320]   That's impressive.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:17.800]   So stings and pain, that's something it can, it definitely alleviates, you know, it helps
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.880]   with the better.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:24.200]   Um, it was me, I, another meat testimony, you know, it's um, you know, wearing this from
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.480]   Dusty Rose sometimes and I got caught in a dust storm behind a cloud, behind a car,
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.240]   which is, you know, no choice, but if I was going to breathe or die, I inhaled a bunch
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.400]   of this dust.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.640]   So the rest of the day, I was like, you know, coughing because the dust stuck in the back
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:41.840]   of my throat, um, by the end of the day, I was like, just dry, hurting, cough, and my
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.840]   throat was sore.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.480]   I mean, it was like raw, it felt raw.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:51.520]   Um, what I did, I mean, I couldn't sleep because it was that raw in, in coughing.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.360]   Um, so what I did is instead of putting the cannula in my nose, I put it at the edge of
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.920]   my mouth to, to breathe in the gas.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:03.520]   And I noticed that quickly soothed my throat, or the soreness aspect of it and I was able
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.520]   to sleep.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.320]   And, and then when it would come out my mouth, it would maybe start hurting again, I'd wake
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   up.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:14.560]   Uh, but, um, but that, um, almost was allowed me to sleep.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:20.640]   It squashed or quenched to pain, the sore, rawness, pain in my throat, enough for me
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:21.640]   to sleep.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:27.880]   And it was, it was pretty quick in, in the, in the reaction time, in treating it.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:32.000]   Yeah, that, if I can jump in, I mean, I just want to, you just reminded me that I, I've
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.400]   never mentioned that I have asthma and every now and then, I mean, it's real rare now because
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:41.800]   I'm, I don't know why, uh, but it, but every now and then I'll start feeling that, you
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:46.160]   know, the cough that, that dry cough kicks in and then you're, you can feel your lungs
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.160]   getting itchy.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.480]   Uh, you know, that kind of stuff feeling, right?
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.760]   But ever since I've got a brownscast machine, the moment that I get that back, you know,
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:59.440]   that deep cough and I, I, you know, it just, my mind goes, Oh crap, you know, I'm getting
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.960]   a, I'm grabbing an asthma attack or it's starting.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.320]   I've learned that just sit on my machine and just inhale for one hour.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:12.040]   And when I do that, it's just the, it never develops beyond that point and it disappears.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:16.660]   Where ads and all of you guys with asthma, you know, right, you know that feeling and
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:21.160]   your lungs start, it's that, you know, you, you can feel your lungs, something's happening.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:25.760]   I call it itchy then that cough and then next thing you know, you're all the time, right?
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:31.320]   Uh, but yeah, I mean, since I've had a brownscast generator and I do that, I have not ever
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:36.960]   gone past that initial feeling and then the attack kicks in and I haven't had to use any
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.240]   of my nebulizers or any of that crap, uh, since I've gotten a brownscast machine.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.600]   So I'd, wow, I just, I never thought about saying that, you know, mentioning that.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.880]   But yeah, lungs, well, you know, it's, but yeah, it's an amazing thing when it comes
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:49.880]   to your lungs.
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:54.040]   Yeah, anything to do with any lung problem at all, it seems because when you, especially
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.520]   when you're inhaling it, breathing it, that's the first place it goes to.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.960]   So that's going to get the best of any treatments.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.440]   Wow.
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:07.880]   So what else are your customers, uh, experience, how are we on time?
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.880]   We're right now.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.880]   Uh, we're doing really well.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.800]   Uh, we are just, we don't want to make this thing over an hour, right?
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.800]   So right, right.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.640]   We are, let's see at about 33 minutes.
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.640]   So yeah.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.640]   Okay.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.640]   Um, yeah.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:25.520]   So on the comps, uh, the topic of, um, bagging in an extra treatment, we'll just roll with
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.680]   that for it now.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:33.120]   Um, another reason when here, um, one of our clients using the machine believes in it
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.120]   fully.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:39.840]   It seems to have cured his, um, wife of, uh, you know, depression and some mental problems.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.360]   So that's all, you know, cured up.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:45.640]   She's getting enough of, um, her, you know, some medication she was taking.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:51.360]   But, um, one of their cousins had a problem with, um, diabetes, I think like 30s, um,
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:55.360]   to the point where they're, I mean, I don't know too much about diabetes and how it affects
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.360]   the feet.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:01.760]   But apparently his foot was swollen or in such pain that he could no longer walk.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.760]   He had to stop working.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:09.240]   He had a business, um, doing like prefab concrete, you know, forms and he had to shut that down.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:14.840]   Two months in bed, in and out of the doctors, going into the third month, um, in his family
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:20.080]   was trying to convince him that the doctors went to operate, um, to, to cut his foot up
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:25.040]   and or, um, cut or I think it was maybe had fluids in it as well.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.160]   But basically they do some surgery on his foot to help alleviate the problem.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.960]   But, um, so this guy was fighting, he's like, I want to do that.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.160]   I don't want them cutting up my foot.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.840]   He's like, I need to find another way.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.680]   And this is when, um, you know, my friend that has a machine, he's like, well, why don't
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.680]   you try this?
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.400]   You mean it's worked for us and for all kinds of issues for us and other people would have
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:47.520]   let try it, um, should come over and let's bag it up and see what it can do.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:53.200]   And so, um, he's been in, you know, in bed, in the wheelchair, can't drive, can't do anything,
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.520]   um, and really just incapacitate.
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:02.720]   So, um, he finds a ride over to, uh, my, my friend's place who has a machine, um, comes
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.720]   at a wheelchair.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.560]   So when he drives him over, get him out, put him in a wheelchair, wheels him in.
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:12.160]   And so for two hours, they bag up his foot, the problem foot in all the pain and gives
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.440]   him, uh, bubbles some hydrogen water for him to take home, though that, you know, that
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.440]   wouldn't last too long.
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:21.160]   But, um, they gave him some water to drink, drank some and then it left some more.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:25.520]   And so they, it was the next day he comes back, um, not only not in a wheelchair, but
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:30.440]   he's walking, but with a limp, he's like, some, that's got, there's gotta be something
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.680]   to that because today I can walk, you know, I'm not in a wheelchair anymore, you know,
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:38.960]   with a limp, it's so hard, but I'm not, you know, as bad as I was yesterday.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.040]   So it was like, I want to do it again.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.920]   So, um, it seemed like for a week, they did it round about.
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.600]   So every day he would go over to my friend's house for an hour or two, they'd bag it up
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.560]   and do a treatment and drink a bunch of water and send them home.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:56.640]   Um, so the, you know, recently I asked him, well, how's it, how's everyone doing with
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.320]   the foot and the diabetes?
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.000]   And he said, well, the last time he came over for a treatment, he was riding a bike.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.600]   He's like, no more pain, his foot is feeling better.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.240]   And he wants to get him, he's like, he's so impressed with the machine that he wants
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:13.680]   to get one for himself, but not only that, he said his, um, family mother or father
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.720]   would benefit from this.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.360]   So he wants to buy himself one and his mother or father one because he seemed what it did
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.360]   for him.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:23.760]   But he also justified that he had to shut down his business for near, it was almost
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.840]   three months at the time.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:31.440]   Um, so he lost thousands of dollars being, and had to lay off his employees while he
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.360]   was in bed trying to recover from this.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.000]   He's like, if I was just, you know, spent the money and knew about this and got it from
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   day one.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.840]   He's like, I wouldn't have been in debt and spent all my money and savings just trying
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.840]   to survive.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.280]   I could have healed myself right away and not have the lay off my employees and get right
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.880]   back to work.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:55.720]   So, I mean, for someone to go from on the brink of surgery, can't even walk in a wheelchair
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:00.400]   next day hopping by the end of the week, you know, feeling fine.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.400]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:07.320]   I'll tell you, right behind happening as diabetes, I'll tell you our country is in bad shape
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.840]   when it comes to that.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:15.160]   Well, there's no substitute for, uh, see, uh, a good diet either.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.160]   So I mean, absolutely.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   You've got to, you've got to clean up your diet first, you know, give up all the sugars
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.080]   and refine carbs, but that would be the first thing I would do if I was, um, diabetic.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.760]   You can't be sitting there kicking and, you know, right chicken and it could play.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.760]   Exactly.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.560]   And then expect to use browns gas, use the oxygen, hydrogen gas and, you know, make
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.920]   it all magic, but go away.
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:41.800]   But if you, if you're generally healthy and could eat healthy and live a healthy lifestyle,
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:48.680]   then, um, this gas can, the hydrogen can help you get back to normal and super health very
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.680]   quickly.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:51.680]   It's amazing.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:57.120]   Uh, that's a great story or any, what, what else, what's your people?
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.800]   That's just amazing hearing all these stories.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.120]   So what, what else?
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.120]   Um, another.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.120]   Go ahead.
[00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:11.000]   Another story, um, with the same friend who's, um, they, um, have a grandfather, they call
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.120]   it abuelo, you know, in Spanish grandfathers, abuelo, um, he was in the house, 93 years
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.120]   old, right?
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.320]   He was in a hospital for two or three months.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.120]   Um, and so he can't do anything else for him.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.960]   He was, um, you know, vomiting, throwing up.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.560]   He couldn't walk very dizzy.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.200]   You know, they did as much work as he can and said, you know, just, you know, send them
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   home.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:36.800]   You know, stable, though he's, you can't take care of himself, but he couldn't stay in the
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   hospital any longer.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.800]   No one wanted that.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.800]   So they send them home.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.680]   And so, um, my friends will hook him up to our machine and let's see if it helps many.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:49.360]   Um, so he takes a machine over to his house, it was pretty close, hooks him up.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:54.680]   And he said, when he went over there, he was basically on the couch, um, couldn't really
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.680]   move.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.680]   It was really dizzy.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.680]   Not so coherent.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.480]   And if he needs to go anywhere, he was basically crawling.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.720]   He couldn't stand up and walk.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.720]   He had the crawl.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.200]   It was also, you know, vomiting.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.400]   He was someone that was there having to take care of them.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.960]   You know, the neighbor has come over and keep an eye on them.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.680]   Um, so my friend didn't have much time.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:15.840]   So he's like, hooked up the machine, plugged him in, um, let him breathe the, the hydrogen.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.040]   And he's like, I'll, I'll be back in a few hours, you know, later, because I need to
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.560]   come in some errands, I'll be back.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:26.040]   And so, um, I'm not, if I get the sort of, it's either the same day, later that evening,
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:30.560]   or the next morning, he says he goes back there and he can't find a wall, he's looking
[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.560]   all over.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.960]   So you went to the neighbor, she's like, where, where's the wall?
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.960]   What happened to him?
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:35.960]   Is he okay?
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.640]   He thought he went over to the neighbor to, to be taken care of.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.080]   He's like, no, I think I saw him all back taking care of the chicken coop or remodeling
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.080]   the chicken coop.
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.880]   He's like, what?
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.920]   He's like, just a few hours ago.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:52.280]   He was, you know, dizzy, barely coherent, throwing up, crawling around the floor because
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:59.640]   he couldn't walk into, you know, almost being normal, it seems like, um, he's like, oh,
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:04.120]   so he found them out, you know, back, so he's talking to a well, he's like, um, okay, well,
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.120]   glad you're better now.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.400]   It's like, I'm going to, you know, take the machine back, now that you're well.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.280]   And so a well, put up a big fight.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.600]   He's like, you're not taking my machine.
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:14.560]   I love the way that air makes me feel.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:19.360]   He's like, go buy your own 93 year old man.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:26.120]   You know, telling his, um, it was like a grandson in law, you know, to go get his own
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.120]   machine.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.120]   You do not take him.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.120]   My machine.
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:35.400]   So, um, I'm just thinking of massive oxygen deprivation, you know, I mean, I don't know
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.400]   what it, what I mean, it fixed so many fist problems so fast.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:43.320]   So, um, so a well, it didn't have the money to buy his own machine, but luckily one of
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.280]   his sons, um, you know, has done well.
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:50.880]   So the family convinced one of his sons to buy him a machine so he can have, you know,
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.880]   permanently.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:56.860]   So he's been using it every day since, um, I know once they borrowed it to treat someone
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:57.860]   else in the family.
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:02.040]   So they took a boy, those machine away for a week and the Disney's came back, you know,
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:06.200]   if he couldn't, he was, you know, dizzy and just didn't feel right, he's like, bring that
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.200]   thing back.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.760]   You know, it's like, I need it.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.520]   Interesting.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.520]   You know, that makes complete sense.
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:20.080]   I'm just thinking because I'm just thinking if you, if we took a look at a person's blood
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:24.040]   after they hook up to a brown's gas, I'm guessing that they're going to have the same
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:28.760]   reaction that they would if they were to be exposed to like a PMF treatment or some of
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.080]   these other treatments where you take the blood, typically it's in, you know, your typical
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.400]   health of a person is the blood is a little bit clustered or even worse, right?
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:42.040]   You got this whole rule of formation claims, you know, the blood, the red blood cells stack
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:47.160]   up in coins and it really deprivates the ability for oxygen transfer within the bloodstream.
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:52.000]   So I'm guessing, and this would be great to find out is, is that brown's gas, one of
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.820]   its, you know, attributes is that it freaking probably just opens up the blood and releases
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:02.240]   all of those clusters and just really improves the level of oxygen.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.240]   Right.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.640]   That's one of, that's one of the exact things that happens.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:11.520]   I found research and videos that I'm with the, with the image you have up on the screen
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:18.880]   here, the, you know, it's number ways to call this, but the expanded, the electric, electrically
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:24.940]   expanded water, it's basically what I understand is the water molecule charged with two extra
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:30.480]   electrons, which almost, instead of having that angle shaped to the water molecule, it's
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:37.160]   almost, you know, those two extra electrons plugged into it, it stretches out that bend
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:42.640]   into almost a linear fashion, and it's not super stable with those extra electrons.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:47.800]   It seems like right before the hydrogen and oxygen break up, you pump electrons into it,
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:52.360]   you know, say one more electron or a little bit more energy, and then it breaks the hydrogen
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.700]   and oxygen bond.
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:58.680]   So there's a pre phase to that, which charges the water molecule.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:05.440]   And that is theoretically, or they, they say, is in a gaseous phase.
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:10.080]   So, you know, consider a negative ion, you know, a negative ion is anything, but molecule
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.440]   or atom that's charged with electrons, it's going to make a charge to it.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:20.240]   So because that's semi stable, once that enters your body, it gives up those electrons.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:27.120]   And if you've got two of anything that's charged, you know, positively or negatively,
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:32.760]   they're going to repel each other, you know, like charges repel and opposite charges attract.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:40.440]   So if these extra electrons, they get into your lungs, which get into your blood in circulation
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:46.080]   really fast, it charges up your blood, negatively with negative ions, which is naturally what
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:50.440]   the body is used to with the Earth is negatively charged, but the whole idea of where lightning
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:53.680]   comes from, you know, the Earth is negatively charged, you know, positive and atmosphere
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:47:01.360]   creates the lightning to neutralize those, the potential difference between those voltages.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:06.080]   So naturally, if you're walking around on the Earth, you're absorbing negative ions
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.920]   or electrons through the soil, you know, we don't have that option these days so much.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:17.640]   We're all walking around and inside on floors isolated from the negative charges with insulated
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.360]   shoes for the most part, right?
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:20.360]   Right.
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:25.880]   So this is a new natural way to get those electrons that our body needs.
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:29.200]   So anyway, go back to the circulation in your blood.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:34.840]   When this charges your blood with the negative ions, the electrons, it separates them.
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:39.600]   It forces them to not clump up, but to repel off of each other.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:44.720]   So in that aspect, you can more easily throw through your blood vessels in the smaller
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:48.660]   capillaries and not stick or clump together.
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:57.800]   A while back, you may remember in our telegram group, we shared a video of Japanese, well,
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.800]   but not a weapon.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:47:59.800]   A fingernail thing.
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   Right.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:01.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:08.080]   So they put a microscope, a little drop of oil on your fingernail under a microscope where
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:13.560]   you can see the capillaries and right where your fingernail meets your skin, where it
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:21.080]   grows from them, there's access to, you can see the capillaries right there and looking
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:26.080]   in the microscope, they do a pass over it and you see all these like U-shaped capillaries
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:30.920]   that, you know, run blood up into your fingernail and back.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.880]   That's how the cells that create your fingernails get nutrients, you know, it needs to get blood
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.480]   and nutrients in there.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:42.040]   And you can see how, I mean, it's kind of hard to tell at first, but there is, you can
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:45.600]   see this U-shape, which is the capillary, and there's a few spots in there, which is
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.600]   the blood.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.600]   I mean, I didn't know at the time when you first started looking at it, but then they
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:55.240]   hook up the client or the person to a candidate to start breathing the hydrogen.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:59.520]   But remember this, within 30 seconds to a minute, you can see that those capillaries
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:04.200]   come alive in what was clotted blood or blood that was not moving freely.
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:06.840]   It just starts, you know, moving and moving.
[00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.960]   In those little bitty clots that were there, they dissolve.
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:14.000]   And you can see the little cells of blood passing through the capillaries.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:21.720]   And it was amazing to see how fast the effect was and how quickly the body reacted once
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.640]   it started breathing the hydrogen or the gas.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.640]   I remember that.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.760]   I'll see if I can find that and put it in the video description for anybody that wants
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:30.760]   to take a look at it.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.720]   But that was, yeah, that was pretty amazing.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:36.720]   That was really amazing.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:40.960]   The fact that the blood, I mean, well, it just, it wasn't just the existing capillaries.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.960]   It actually expanded beyond where even the other, you know, it started creating, not
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:50.000]   creating new capillaries, but you could see the other ones waking up and getting, you
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   know, flushing.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.960]   I mean, flushing is a better word for it.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.960]   When you started flushing up.
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:55.960]   Right.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:56.960]   It just increases circulation.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:01.000]   So if it acted that quickly on those small capillaries in your fingernails, which you
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.120]   can really see and you can relate to, just seeing it and watching it move, you know,
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.360]   being stuck before and moving afterwards, you just think of what it's doing in the rest
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.400]   of your body and how it's healing things.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:15.120]   It, one of the underlying principles that's going on, which is helping heal the body is
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:21.880]   increasing circulation and access to nutrients in those capillaries that may be clogged up
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:27.040]   or your blood cells may be clumping up and not being able to so quickly pass to the capillaries
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.840]   and bring nutrients and oxygen to where it's needed.
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:35.280]   Just that alone would be enough to justify some of the healing that we're experiencing.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.280]   No, you're right.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.280]   Absolutely.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:42.000]   That's kind of interesting that you mentioned that I'd never thought about the fact that
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.440]   I know that, I know that, I mean, I'm inhaling additional electrons is basically, you know,
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.840]   put you bubble the water, you're literally drinking electrons, you're inhaling electrons.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:56.360]   I never thought of it as a substitute for grounding, although I, you know, but you're
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.360]   right though.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.360]   It's kind of funny.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:03.960]   I just realized when you said that I don't have the same situations that I used to have
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:08.400]   when I didn't ground enough, you know, because I'm always breathing.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.800]   So yeah, you're right.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.360]   It does really pump you up.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.360]   Interesting.
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:16.360]   Because I used to, in the old days before I had a generator, I'd always try to make a,
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:20.960]   you know, remind myself to go outside and ground, but you never quite have enough time,
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:21.960]   right?
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:22.960]   So I would always...
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:23.960]   Exactly.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:26.720]   Oh, man, I have a ground for a couple of days and I'm feeling really off, but I don't
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:28.720]   ever feel off anymore ever, you know.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.400]   I still ground as much as I can, but yeah, you're right.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.400]   That's interesting.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.400]   Yeah, man.
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:39.240]   I come from the viewpoint of a, you know, a physicist and an electrical, electrical engineer.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.240]   Right.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:43.960]   And I did that in school, like official schooling, as they would say, right?
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:49.920]   Once I got out of school, all my personal research and learning has been in health and
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.120]   in the biomedical field.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:58.560]   So we're doing a gap between physics, electrical engineering and how the voltage and charges
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:05.000]   work, as well as what I understand now with reading so many research papers on health.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.920]   So I'm able to make some of these connections.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:14.400]   Oh, yeah, since, you know, since I got into what I do, I've read a lot, learned a lot,
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:19.280]   studied a lot, and you know, it just, it just comes down to electrons.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:24.920]   I mean, whether you're taking vitamin C or breathing in browns gas or doing C60, it's
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:32.120]   electrons and it's all about ion transforms and the electrical charge of different chemicals
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:35.000]   in our bodies and how it all comes down to that.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.800]   It really comes down to this whole bio-electro, electro, you know, activity and the way that
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   our bodies work.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:46.200]   I mean, we really are electrical beings and once you understand that, you know, as opposed
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:50.520]   to take a chemical and everything's, everything, every problem is going to be solved by some
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:54.600]   chemical, but you know, that's not true because we're more than just a chemical being.
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:59.640]   We're also an electrical being and once you understand it, like, you know, yeah, I mean,
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:00.640]   what's books on the subject?
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:01.640]   It's also good.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:06.360]   I was just going to say one of the best books on the subject is healing, you know, healing
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:12.320]   is voltage right when Jerry Tennant, so, yeah, definitely understanding that, understands
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.600]   you understand health, true health.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:15.600]   Would you agree, Mandy?
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.600]   Right.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.600]   Hey, you guys, I, you're awfully quiet.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:25.800]   If you have any questions, you know, jump in, she's immediately over here, she comes.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.360]   Yeah, Mandy owns the full tenant thing.
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:32.920]   So she's really on board on the tenant.
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:33.920]   Okay.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:38.740]   So, I say we're quick to, on the subject you just mentioned, but what's, what I find
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:44.120]   incredibly amazing, I'm talking about how the body's electric and how at such a fundamental
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:49.400]   core level on how the body generates this energy inside the mitochondria, which is a
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:57.480]   whole crazy sort in and of itself, what that is and where it comes from, how using hydrogen,
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:03.400]   the, the mitochondria basically cleave off a hydrogen atom from sugars called the hydrates,
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:08.120]   proteins, that has just the right bond to keep it stable, but not strong enough where
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.800]   the mitochondria can't pull it off.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:17.000]   But basically it pulls off a hydrogen atom from what we consider a call food, it then
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.880]   it rips off the, it rips apart the proton and electron and puts that through a, the
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:29.400]   Krebs cycle, which is, you know, three plus steps of a process and in the end of the process
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:35.080]   out pops an ATP molecule, which the body is used for energy, like gasoline for the body,
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.080]   basically.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.080]   Yep.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.760]   And at the, at the complete end of the cycle, it produces water.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:42.920]   So you bought it, you're breathing oxygen from the air, it's in the atmosphere, but
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:43.920]   there's no hydrogen.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.320]   So you need the hydrogen that comes from the food normally.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.320]   Right.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:53.200]   You know, it's incredibly interesting to me that at its most core level, the, the mitochondria
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:59.120]   and our energy come from the hydrogen atom, it rips, it rips it apart, puts it back together
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:03.600]   and ends up with water, basically the, what rocket engines run off of, you know, hydrogen
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.600]   and oxygen.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:05.600]   Absolutely.
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.600]   That's the thing.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.960]   I mean, you know, like, I try to, when I try to explain to people about health, you
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:13.600]   know, talking about the bio-electral aspect of it, but there's the other aspect of it
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:19.000]   that we're, we are as adult human beings, roughly like an 11 and a half gallon salt
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.160]   water aquarium, wrapped up.
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.240]   And so we are literally water.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:30.360]   And when you think of water, H2O, when that, that means that the most prevalent molecule
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:34.640]   in our bodies is hydrogen and oxygen, right?
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.160]   And, and, and of course, there's a whole bunch of carbon in there.
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.240]   So, yeah, I mean, this just absolutely makes sense.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.480]   Hey, you know, we're rounding up on an hour.
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:48.040]   And I wanted to kind of talk about your product because I know that you're working on an enhancement
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:49.040]   to PMF.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:53.120]   So I kind of wanted to get a, just kind of like get a feel for that real quick before
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:54.120]   we end.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:58.800]   So what I want to do, those let everybody know, watching this webinar at a later date,
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:03.400]   I do want to just, just mention one little thing real quick as an additional testimonial
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:10.720]   is this week for the first time I tried treating my eyes by putting a brownscast inside a set
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.080]   of goggles.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:16.560]   And I'm just trying to see if it'll, you know, help my vision, right?
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:20.360]   Because when I first started doing brownscast, my vision improved.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:24.720]   And I'd say like it got, let's say it went 100 better, but now it's back to like 50 better.
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.720]   So it did go, you know, throttle back down in terms of improvement.
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:32.120]   So I'm trying to get back to that, you know, so I'm trying to see if it'll do anything.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:35.120]   But my first attempt was it really dried out my eyes.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:39.600]   So I'm just wondering, if anybody out there has a suggestion, like, how can you treat
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:43.840]   your eyes directly with brownscast?
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:47.800]   And then, you know, of course, not dry them out because they were, they got pretty dried
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:48.800]   out.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:53.360]   So I'm thinking I got to kind of, have you, has any of your customers tried treating their
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.360]   eyes?
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:57:00.560]   No, but that's something I want to do for myself as well.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:06.600]   I mean, I'm just now starting to need reading glasses and, you know, we mentioned like honey
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.600]   before.
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.600]   Some people use that for cataracts.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:15.320]   And I've done a little bit of that, but I think hydrogen in this, in the gas, brownscast
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.320]   could help.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:21.680]   And like you said, the trick would be to help, uh, you modify that or maybe put some drops
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:25.040]   in the eyes to keep them overly, um, lubricated.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:29.920]   Well, I would say they don't try out because I'm like, I run the gas through two bubblers
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:33.400]   and I'm thinking, is there, because I know there's a way to dry the gas, right?
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:37.800]   There's, there's dryers where you dry the gas, take the immunity out of the gas.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:42.400]   But is there anything that you could actually use to put humidity into the gas?
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:47.440]   Well, normally those bubblers we put have on the side, they're called humidifier bottles
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:51.200]   to put, you know, good water vapor back into it.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.440]   So the gray gas is not overly dry.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:59.640]   But I'm thinking for the eyes, I would look at putting some, uh, lubricating drops in
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:00.640]   the eyes.
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:01.640]   Okay.
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:05.840]   Also, I mean, the honey at the same time also helps lubricate the eyes.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:09.920]   It's things at first when you first put it in, but that in combination with the browns
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:12.600]   gas may be, um, uh, a good combination.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:20.920]   You put honey in your eyes or go ahead, um, what it made a saline solution with the browns
[00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:24.000]   gas bubble to water and use that for eye drops.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.880]   Um, yeah, that could definitely work, um, whatever solution you're going to be putting
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:33.480]   your eyes, whatever drops that is, you bubble it through the, uh, the hydrogen first.
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:34.480]   Mm hmm.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.480]   Okay.
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:38.920]   I'm going to tinker around with that and I'll let you know how it works out.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:43.000]   Um, so the other thing is, let's talk about before we go.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.840]   I do want to talk about you're working on, now here's your product.
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:47.840]   This is your website.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:53.600]   And for all you folks, uh, Ben's website is H2 biohacker, um, and his product is the
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.800]   H2 Genesis.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:59:00.520]   So, um, let me just see if I pop over to the H2 Genesis where, where is that guy somewhere
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.240]   here?

[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:54.320]   But what I wanted to chat about was, uh, this is your current model, but are you, you're
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:59.560]   right now, aren't you adding like PMF, like, uh, like something else to it or, or is that
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.880]   still in the works?
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:06.600]   Um, that's something I, you know, I'm experimenting with and we definitely added to a test unit
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.600]   here.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:13.760]   Um, but in my latest experiments, like using the PMF on my shoulder and comparing the effectiveness
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:19.680]   of, of effectiveness of that, um, to just applying browns gas in the sleeve I showed
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:25.280]   you earlier, um, I'm in no rush to do any PMF, you know, I'm, I'm thinking that it's
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:32.800]   almost, not necessarily a waste of time, but it's definitely not, um, worth, uh, pursuing
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:41.000]   that, uh, to, to the degree or as fast as I was before, based on my last experiments.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.240]   So that's kind of on hold right now.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:48.240]   That's something we may do in the future, but everything we throw this rounds gas at this
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:52.480]   oxyhydrogen that hydrogen, I hope you want to call it, um, it's fixing.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.560]   So I almost, I'm very little need for almost any other supplements or any other devices
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.560]   out there now.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.560]   I mean, that's my personal opinion.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.560]   No, no.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.560]   I, well, yeah.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.040]   So that's kind of like, I was thinking, cause I know you were looking at a PMF to treat
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.080]   your shoulder, but if you figured out that, yeah, it's kind of like you don't get the
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.080]   value ads.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.080]   So why bother?
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:15.480]   And that's why I, like I said, I purposely delayed treating myself with the, the, the
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.160]   hydrogen to see how the PMF would work.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:21.760]   And I'm, the coil I made was fairly strong and I tried all different frequencies.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.560]   And I did notice, um, it did help.
[01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:30.840]   Um, it would loosen it up in the pain go away, but it did not heal and I didn't get the results
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:36.320]   nearly as fast as I did once I started using the sleeve where my shoulder was completely
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.920]   encased in the hydrogen for hours at a time, you know, while it's sleeping.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:45.620]   And so, you know, the, the PMF adding that to the, I'm assuming that the moment is kind
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:50.640]   of, you know, on hold for now, it's not worth the, the benefit is not worth the, the work
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.640]   at this point.
[01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:52.640]   Okay.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:58.520]   So for those of you aren't familiar with Ben's website, uh, there's a page of just the testimonial.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:03.320]   So, uh, there's some, like just voice clips, there's, uh, other types of tests.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.160]   You can listen to other different customers actually call in and, and, you know, talk
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.160]   to him.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.720]   And then as you can see all the other different testimonials out there.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:16.120]   So if anybody's interested in the rounds gas, a lot more can it do, uh, it goes beyond
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:20.800]   this webinar and it kind of gets into like you can go to his testimonial page, uh, and
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.160]   you can also go and check out the studies.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.840]   He's got a full page of just studies.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.360]   Uh, that's why I love your, I love your site.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:32.120]   You really pack it in there, um, in terms of all the different, uh, ailments and the
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.480]   different studies where molecular hydrogen can help that.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.640]   So, uh, I do want to point that out.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:39.960]   So if anybody's interested in learning more about that.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.680]   And you know, in terms of like ideas, because I'm a, I'm a tinker and I'm always trying
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:48.400]   to figure out different ways of doing things, thus the whole goggle test this week, but
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:52.080]   I did want to point out something and maybe it's something you could think about doing.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:56.800]   Um, just for this, I was doing some research just to see like, what's the current, like
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.800]   the absolute most recent studies that are coming out about molecular hydrogen.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.960]   And you know, one of the things that I thought was interesting, uh, Ben was there's, there's
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:12.720]   this one study that actually said that inhaling, uh, H2 hydrogen could facilitate lipid metabolism
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.520]   during aerobic exercise and what this, and it, by the way, there'll be, uh, this little
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.600]   page here, I'm not going to get into it, but, uh, if you want to read any of these studies,
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.280]   I'll put the links in the video description, but I want to point out this one study and
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.880]   what this means to me, right?
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:32.360]   Because you know how they've got these oxygen, um, things at, at gyms now where you can kind
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:36.120]   of hook up like the Vaspur hook ship to all that cold water, but then they got the oxygen
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.800]   mask and you could be like, you know, doing your spinning class with the oxygen thing.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:46.280]   But here's a study that says, and it proved that if you're breathing in hydrogen, right?
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:51.480]   While you're exercising, it burns your fat better than if you did it, just breathing
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.480]   air.
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.680]   And I thought that was really, so what about like, so I'm thinking like a tinker, right?
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:01.200]   I'm like, oh, you know, we should get Ben to create like a mask or you could be like
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.840]   exercising and you could be hooked up to your brownscast thing.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.320]   Is that something that you like, you know, I'm just throwing some ideas at you because
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.320]   it's good.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.320]   It's a good idea.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.800]   I like the way you're thinking, but I don't the practicality of it may not necessarily
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:19.080]   be there, but along the same lines as this study you just mentioned, I noticed others
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:24.120]   noticed and I found other research that shows that just breathing the gas or using these
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:31.160]   hydrogen therapies alone is enough to reduce your body fat content and build muscle.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:35.360]   So you can do nothing other than, you know, breathe the gas and just sit around doing
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.640]   your same old lifestyle.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.560]   You can gain muscle and lose fat.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:42.800]   But the effects are in hand, I noticed that with myself and others mentioned that as well
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.720]   as like, man, I'm losing weight and I feel like I'm getting muscle, you know, I'm not
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.760]   doing anything different.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.600]   But that's like the dream right there.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:55.720]   Yeah, yeah, it's not like, I mean, it won't make you, you know, Arnold Schwarzenegger
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.680]   shouldn't sit near your desk, right?
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.520]   But for athletes, it does take it to another level.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:07.920]   So you will definitely notice enhanced, you know, fat burning and muscle gain when you
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:13.280]   were, you know, doing a hydrogen therapy type of protocol, I mean, what this is saying
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:17.200]   here is it's the same, the same thing I said in a different way, you know, inhaling how
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.720]   you could facilitate lipid metabolism during aerobic exercise.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:23.440]   Well, you don't necessarily have to be doing it during exercise.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.960]   There's a residual effect as well.
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:34.880]   So I think it's, like I said, the practicality of it is not there, but you get say 70%, 80%
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:39.440]   of the effect by breathing before or drinking the water before and or after.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.440]   Right.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:47.520]   That's, that's actually been proven in everybody is that browns gas, hydrogen, molecular hydrogen
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:53.680]   really increases your recovery rate, improves your recovery rate after strenuous exercise.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.440]   You know, yeah, definitely.
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:59.320]   So I was thinking that you just get like, you know, because the cannulas come in like
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:03.240]   four feet, seven feet lengths, you just get a long one and then you're sitting there
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:07.840]   spinning and you can be breathing at the same time because, you know, okay, so I could
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:13.960]   if you have, if you have a spinning bicycle in your house in real treadmill, you can do
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:14.960]   that.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:15.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:18.400]   It's pretty easy to come when you, the cannulas get old, you know, we cut off the part that
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:22.880]   loops around your ears and you can cascade all these cannulas together to make a real,
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.600]   I've connected as many as five together.
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:29.000]   So I can sit it together as the end of the house and watch a movie with my kid, you know,
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   so it works.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   All right.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.840]   So what I want to point out is there's this one paper that I'm, the recent paper, I think
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:41.840]   it came out in November 2020 or something like that, development of molecular hydrogen
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:42.840]   medicine.
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.680]   And I really want to point out anyone that's interested in what hydrogen could do for you
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.360]   in brown skies.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:52.160]   Basically, there's this read this paper, the link in the video description.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:55.200]   And it's got the reason one of the things that's got this really cool little graphic
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:00.800]   that kind of just sums up a lot of what we've actually been talking about in terms of testimonials.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:06.240]   It's like, what happens when you administer hydrogen and, you know, and in the form of
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:11.000]   browns gases, hydrogen and oxygen plus electrically expanded water, but you've got all of these
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:17.920]   incredible benefits that come from this because browns gas is molecular hydrogen therapy plus
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:22.440]   electrically expanded water, you know, therapy, I guess is a better phrase, but negative
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:23.440]   ions.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.560]   Yeah, the whole aspect is that you've got a double benefit.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.680]   It's not just buying a hydrogen machine, but you're getting a browns gas, which is
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.160]   hydrogen machine plus.
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:39.800]   And so the paper really does talk about the positive effects on aging, on fatigue, radiation
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.760]   damage, vascular, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:47.040]   So you can just see this, this diagram just really demonstrates that the multiple different
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:51.160]   facets of benefits that you get from the gas, and it's pretty amazing.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:57.040]   So these are all third party peer reviewed papers, video description, and feel free to
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.040]   learn more.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.640]   Yeah, any parting, any parting thoughts?
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:06.480]   Yeah, a couple of quick things to add, the price that's currently on a website, that
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.480]   may be going up 100 bucks in the next month.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:13.560]   So this may be the last month that it's at this price, just because word of mouth is,
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:17.680]   you know, increasing a lot and we're like barely keeping up with just the word of mouth
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.040]   orders that are coming in.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:25.440]   So to expand our facility and get more help, you know, we may have to gradually raise the
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.440]   price a little bit.
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:32.080]   We want to keep go up too much, but it may go up at 100 bucks, you know, maybe maybe
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.920]   two over the next year, but we'll see.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:34.920]   All right.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:39.800]   So, and then also we've got some people that are talking about doing some, you know, large
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.800]   orders.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:45.360]   So if those come in, you know, first come first serve, so that's just, it's up to keep
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:46.360]   in mind.
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.360]   So, okay.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:51.840]   So right now though, let's say for the next 30 days while we've got this discount code,
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:56.720]   it's 1495 and 100 bucks off using the discount code, but then after that, it's going to
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:57.720]   go up.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.720]   All right.
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:08:59.720]   Right.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.720]   Right.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.200]   We can keep it at that for this month, at least while we're, you know, talking about mentioning
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.200]   here.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.200]   All right.
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:05.200]   Thanks for the help.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:10.880]   And then let's say there was one other thing I wanted to mention, and it escapes me at
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.880]   the moment.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:16.080]   Oh, yeah, this is it.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.720]   Real quick, another real quick testimonial, someone just recently came by to pick up a
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:23.840]   machine they just bought, and as they're leaving, they said, oh, by the way, I talked
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:27.520]   to so-and-so and the client of yours, the bottom machine, and this is kind of what,
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:29.880]   you know, clinched it for them to get a machine.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.560]   They're like, they asked them, like, well, what do you think of Ben's machine that I
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:33.560]   choose Genesis?
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.560]   How do you like it?
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.400]   And she was like, I put it this way.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.880]   If someone broke into my house and stole it, I'd buy another one right away.
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:47.760]   Oh, yeah, like that pretty much says it.
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:52.400]   Or everything else before the new laptop, I got to have my beach.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.360]   Yeah, I got to admit though, it's the first thing I do every day.
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.080]   I sit at my desk, I bubble my bottle of water, I hook up on the canada.
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.480]   It's it's the one more quick thing to mention.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:08.160]   I found a found a way that this is going to, I might kind of reserve this for the client
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.720]   said by the machine, just as one more, one less instead of, but well, two things, two
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:12.720]   quick things.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:19.000]   I soon started a form for clients only that I'll be giving special extra treatment and
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.760]   probably gifts to an extra, they'll be the first to to get some of our new experiments
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.320]   and research right there that we're getting into.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:31.520]   So for example, the sleeve and some other things that we're working on.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:36.400]   But I found a way, and I've tested it also on several people, to increase the effectiveness
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:40.520]   of the hydrogen water, nearly almost 10 fold.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:41.520]   Wow.
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:45.920]   So I'm going to reserve that for clients at buy the machine.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.640]   I think I kind of eluded it to you.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.640]   Okay.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:53.880]   So you may know, but let's keep that a little secret for now until we release it.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:58.880]   Just so I only give that and we'll be giving away that'll be coming with some of the machines
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:03.720]   in the future, that extra tweak to increase the effectiveness.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:08.120]   But I'm, I've given some people some of this water and they're like blown away.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.120]   Wow.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.320]   So you found a way to feel it.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.400]   To get the water to hold more gas.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.920]   Is that what you've done?
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.920]   Right.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:15.920]   Wow.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:16.920]   Exactly.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.400]   That's been like the holy grail in the chat room is people trying to figure that out.
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:22.400]   Oh, cool.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:27.360]   Well, there's actually, there's actually two things that we're, we're doing, like that
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.360]   can be done.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.920]   Either one of them will work, but there's one in particular that has been like, you
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:35.840]   know, off the charts and that'll be getting great feedback.
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:38.600]   So reserve that for the people for our direct clients.
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:42.880]   And we may show that eventually with everyone, but from the little teaser there.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.880]   Yeah.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.880]   No kidding.
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.040]   Well, we'll leave everybody with that thought.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.040]   Hey, okay.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:51.640]   So now if people want to get ahold of you, it's through your website, right?
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:56.040]   H2Biohacker, there's going to be a link in the description below.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.280]   And if you want to get ahold of me, I'm at the Tinkers Academy.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.840]   That's my blog.
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:04.960]   And also, just as I mentioned earlier, we have an H-O and H2 experience telegram chat
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:05.960]   group.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.240]   And that's where you can jump in and get ahold of any of us.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:12.180]   Questions, interact with other people using Brown's guess and H2D and so forth.
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:17.000]   So all the links are in the video description and everyone is welcome.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.840]   Any parting words?
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:19.840]   Anybody?
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.840]   Nope.
[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:21.840]   I think that's it for me.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.840]   There's a great call.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:25.160]   We got a lot of good information out this time.
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.160]   Thank you so much.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.160]   And thanks for watching the video.
