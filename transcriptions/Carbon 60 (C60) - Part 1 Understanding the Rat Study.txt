[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   Hi, my name is Calmer and if you've heard of carbon 60 or C60 as it's also known and
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.840]   are either taking it yourself or giving it to your animals, we'll welcome aboard.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.360]   So I've been taking C60 for several months now and giving it to my 8 year old dog and
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.560]   I'm seeing some very interesting results and during that time I've done a lot of research
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.120]   on 660 that I'd really like to share with you to help you better understand and help
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.640]   you better do your research with yourself and with your animals so that you can get the
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.400]   most out of C60 for your life.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.120]   So what I did was is break it out into three video series where part one is understanding
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.220]   the right study.
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.500]   That's this video.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.080]   I think it's really important to understand this study because it is where this all began.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.280]   This is the study that showed you can extend life using C60 if you're a rat, very important
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.200]   point and how do you translate that study to being human and being a horse or being
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.200]   a dog.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.000]   Well that's going to be kind of in part two where I talk about understanding dosages.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.680]   The third part will be how to make your own C60 oil for those of you who are interested
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.680]   in doing it.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.800]   A lot of people I know are actually making their own oil and they're getting really good
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.800]   results.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.880]   So let's start right away and just jump right into part one understanding the rat study.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.200]   The abstract of the study was simply this, they gave a bunch of rats, C60, they lived
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.600]   a long time longer than their peers who didn't take it the end.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.120]   If you're interested, I've actually put a link below where you can actually take a look
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.240]   at the actual scientific study that was published in 2012.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.960]   The title of the study is The Prolongation of the Lifespan of Rats by repeated oral administration
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.120]   of C60 fluorine and you can see right here the number of scientists that were involved
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.480]   and the length of the report is 11 pages and a lot of scientific information about the
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.280]   specificity of dissecting livers and so forth.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.440]   So if that's your thing, feel free to read that and it's available to you.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.240]   Otherwise here we go.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.100]   Number one, methodology.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.600]   This is the really important part because if you're trying to do this and your dogs
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.240]   are trying to do this, you might want to know exactly how they did it in the study.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.400]   So number one was what was the purity of the C60 that was actually added to the oil that
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.120]   they gave to the rats and in the study it was 99.98%.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.360]   So for any of you guys who've actually looked at SCS research where they got the C60 fluorines,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.600]   you'll see that that is the highest level of purity that they provide.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.200]   The type of oil was a virgin olive oil that they actually procured directly from the manufacturer.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.040]   Directly from the farms that produced it in Tunisia, which is very, very important.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.120]   For anybody who knows, if you do any studies on olive oil, you'll find out that literally
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.400]   90 plus percent of olive oil on the shelf everywhere you go and on Amazon is not really
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   olive oil.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.800]   It may be a blend of olive oil.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.960]   It may not even be olive oil, but they've been in so many studies on olive oil and most
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.800]   of it, I mean literally the majority of it is not real.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.320]   So they knew that and of course they went directly to the source to get pure real olive
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.320]   oil.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.320]   The other thing was how much olive, C60 is in the oil and that was 0.8 milligrams per
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.920]   milliliter and then the dosage, how much did they give those rats and the amount was stated
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.920]   in the study.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.000]   They gave them 1.7 milligrams per kilogram of body weight and how they did it was they
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.280]   gave it to them every single day for seven days, then weekly for two months and then
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.920]   every two weeks thereafter until the end of the study.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.080]   We're going to talk a lot more about dosages in part two.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.040]   The results now, well, the very first results of the study, which was the whole focus by
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.280]   the way, of the study was to determine how much of C60 was, you know, how much C60 is
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.920]   toxic and so that's what they set out to try to understand.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.080]   They did not set out to try to prolong the life of rats.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.040]   That was what happened when they were trying to see how much C60 would kill the rats and
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.520]   so the first thing they did was they looked at oxidative stress and they started giving
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.640]   all these rats C60 and how they did it was they took three groups of these special kind
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.720]   of rats called Willstar rats, all males and they broke them into three groups.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.680]   Their first group, group A, was given just water.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.280]   That was their control group and they wanted just a group of just, you know, we're not
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.480]   going to mess with you guys and we'll see what happens.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.800]   They have a second group that just took olive oil and a third group which was given C60 in
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.280]   the olive oil.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.880]   What was interesting was the results were, and this is what happens with Willstar rats
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.560]   was the median lifespan was 22 months.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.080]   Typically, Willstar rats, according to research, will live about anywhere from, you know, 24,
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.040]   28 maybe up to, you know, 30 months but typically the median was 22 months and that's just
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.280]   not messing with them.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.600]   Now the ones that just took pure olive oil, know nothing else but that, they actually
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.520]   lived 18% longer.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.400]   Their average median lifespan was 26 months which is amazing and it actually explains
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.040]   the Mediterranean diet if anyone knows about that and so just heads up.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.720]   If you're taking pure olive oil and eating that stuff and, you know, that's extending
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.560]   your life right off the bat or at least not, sorry, not extending your life but helping
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.900]   you with your oxidative stress.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.760]   Now here's the kicker which is the C60 in the olive oil.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:47.800]   The median lifespan for those rats was 42 months which was 90% longer than the control
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.360]   group.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.360]   That was the most profound conclusion or result from this study was that, hey, you give these
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.920]   guys C60 they're going to live a lot longer, practically twice as long as the ones who
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:08.160]   don't get it and that's what started everything about C60 today.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.320]   Most interesting is that 38 months, all of the rat A's rats were dead.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.440]   The group A's rats all died off but at that moment in time at 38 months, all of the rats
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.320]   who took C60 were still alive which is a huge, huge deal.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.440]   And why we're doing this.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.240]   Now when they looked at toxicity which is interesting is they poisoned these guys to
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.200]   see how much damage the poison would do to these three groups of rats.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.280]   So they had a lot of rats, so they took some rats and they poisoned them and the rest,
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.560]   they let live their life spans.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.920]   And then once they got poisoned, the ones that were just on water, they got really, really
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.920]   sick.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.920]   They showed all these different, you know, the skin and they got lethargic and they were
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.240]   sick.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.320]   And so they got sick and they stayed sick and at the 24 hour mark, they were sacrificed
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.600]   and dissected to see how bad they were, how bad was the damage to their livers, etc.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.680]   Now the B group B that just got olive oil, they got sick but they got all of the symptoms,
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.080]   all of the behaviors that had changed from being healthy to sick, they had gotten fully
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.520]   back to normal in five hours and same thing with the C60 group.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.200]   Now what happens is when they dissected these rats, they discovered that the ones of course
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.720]   that had just been on water, they opened them up and you can see this in the study.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.160]   They looked at their livers and the ones that just had water, who got sick, stayed sick,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.080]   their livers were severely damaged, pale in color, didn't look good, definitely damaged.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.120]   The olive oil ones were damaged but not as severe, but the C60 ones, which is most amazing,
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:54.440]   but absolutely normal livers, completely unaffected by the toxins and that is what led them to
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:03.240]   the conclusion that C60's ability to mitigate oxidative stress, toxins in your liver was
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:10.440]   the reason, or one of the believed reasons that it prolonged life, very important information.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:17.760]   Now the other findings of the study that I wanted to share with you is that C60 is absorbed
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.480]   in the gastrointestinal tract and what's important about that was they gave the rats two different
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.480]   ways.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.520]   They either give it to them directly into the bloodstream or they put it in their mouth.
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   The ones that they were jabbing, they had to stop because that was detrimental to their
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.760]   health so they'd stop doing that but they kept giving it to them orally.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.880]   What happens when they measured them because the third study was the bioaccumulation study,
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:50.240]   they discovered that the C60 basically is eliminated in the body in 97 hours.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.880]   Keep that in mind during dosaging, 97 hours is when it finally flushes out of you and
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.760]   the whole idea is to load up, maintain so that you always have some in your body otherwise
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.840]   it just flushes right out.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:10.400]   Now C60 is also active in a soluble form in lipid droplets, living inside cells as well
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:17.360]   as in fats and what that means is that C60, like vitamin C, another strong antioxidant
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.240]   is water soluble so if you just take it, it's just going to go right through you.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:30.240]   But if you wrap a fat cell around it or you, what they call liposomal, your body will recognize
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:36.280]   that as a fat molecule, as something it wants and it will absorb that fat molecule with
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:42.840]   a little hidden package inside of C60 and so they found that was how they were, that's
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.120]   why they put it in oil and that's what worked.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:51.480]   It also found out that C60 can freely cross the membrane barriers which is very important
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:58.960]   because really what that means was is that they found out because of that ability that
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:05.320]   C60 can go to places in the organism that other natural antioxidants do not go which
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:11.720]   is a superior bio distribution of an antioxidant that no other antioxidant does, another very
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.680]   interesting finding of the study.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:22.960]   Also too, when they dissected the olive oil and the C60 rats, what happened was they discovered
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.600]   that there was large deposits of fat due to the accumulation of the administered lipids
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.480]   and the oil that they had gotten.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.560]   So that's something to really keep in mind is that you're taking a lot of oil, you can't
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.040]   just take the powder, you have to take it in the oil for your body to absorb it but if
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.920]   you're taking in all that oil, it's going to accumulate and which is not good, it's
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.720]   not that good to have too much of that in your body but here's the kicker, it actually
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:55.040]   states in the study that the normal, well I forgot how to pronounce this, parent come
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:00.800]   all, architecture, without any inflammation or fibrosis due to lipid accumulation.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.440]   Hey what's that mean, well hey that means that even though you took all that oil in, we are
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.880]   also taking it in with C60, so the C60 kind of helped you out and even though you got
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:16.200]   a bunch of oil in your body that's normally bad for you, the C60 was there to basically
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.200]   help out.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.760]   So it didn't create any problems that would be normally attributed to oils which I thought
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.480]   was very interesting.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:32.040]   Now the last thing is that all of the rats died from aging, so nobody lived forever but
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:41.120]   the thing was as the rats grow old, they always have tumors and this is a quote from one of
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.400]   the scientists but the ones that took C60, they didn't develop any tumors like the control
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.400]   rats, so in other words all the ones that took water had tumors, all the ones that took
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.360]   water had all of oil eventually had some tumors and died but when the C60 rats finally died
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:02.480]   off and they dissected them, they didn't have any tumors in them, keep that in mind.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.920]   Okay again lastly, there is a little piece in the introduction section that actually talks
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.800]   a little bit about C60 other studies and I wanted to share this with you because some
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:18.120]   of the findings of people and critters that are taking the C60 kind of attribute to this
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.760]   which is that they've been studying C60 since 1993 and it's derivatives and they've been
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.240]   finding out that it does different things other than just life extension and it's actually
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:35.400]   been found to help with UV and radio protection, anti-viral, antioxidant which is what they
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.960]   found out and anti-amyloid activities whatever that means, immune stimulating and anti-tumor
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.840]   effects which you just heard about and hair growing which is really amazing to me that
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.760]   it actually has been shown to improve hair growing if you see videos of Cliff High and
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:57.240]   he takes a lot of it and he still bald his fuck. Anyway so that concludes my research
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:03.880]   on C60. Thank you very much, please stay tuned for the part two which we'll be talking
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:11.160]   about dosages where I'm going to try to compare the study to how much you can really take
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:17.280]   and compare that to what's available in the market, help you figure out the amount that
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.800]   you probably should take if you want to replicate the study and the economics all of it. So I'll
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.000]   be working on that over the next week or so and I'll be getting that out to you. So thanks
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.120]   again and I really appreciate you stopping by. Aloha.
