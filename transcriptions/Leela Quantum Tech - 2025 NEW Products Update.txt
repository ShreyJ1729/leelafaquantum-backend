[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.640]   Elmer and today is a very special video with Phillip on Holtzendorf from Leila Quantum Tech
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:15.920]   where he's going to share with us the new products coming for Leila and the new frequencies in 2025.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.520]   So today is Chris, or not Christmas, but New Year's Eve 1231 and so in a couple of days there'll be
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.360]   some really cool new things on the website available for purchase. So Phillip, how are you doing today
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.640]   and thanks for joining me? Thanks for having me K. I'm looking forward to this. I'm doing great
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.320]   even though I must say the last day of the year is is crazy. So there's a lot going on. I'm looking
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.640]   forward to the new year. Oh yeah, you had a very busy year. Every time I look at your Instagram,
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.520]   you're at some new conference and I mean, I don't, I'm like, how many miles do you log
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.560]   every year because you are so well-traveled and you're zipping back and forth between
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.120]   Europe and United States to do interviews and conferences and you know, whatever and then
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.080]   you've got the thing going on in Costa Rica. It's just, I can't imagine how much you have to fly.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.880]   Yeah, it's indeed a lot and especially it was now a lot in the last three weeks. So because I
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:25.360]   literally went a lot of miles within Florida, then I had to fly to Costa Rica then to Las Vegas
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.560]   because there's a big event that I needed to attend and actually quite exciting. And then from
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.040]   Vegas, I flew to Germany then from there to Switzerland and I just got back two days ago.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.680]   But it's okay. Thankfully, I don't have jet lag anymore, which is phenomenal. I literally,
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.840]   every year, the older I got, the worse my jet legs would get and now I don't have it anymore.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.040]   I know how to deal with it and that helps a lot. So you're just wearing the Leila jacket while
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.840]   you're on the plane with the EMF beanie and just kind of protecting yourself that way. I mean,
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.680]   I'm sure everyone's interested in how you do that. Yeah, so I certainly leverage that. I
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.520]   leverage the quantum upgrade and I put it on heel 360 because we found that to be the best
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.760]   during the plane also in regards to the benzene gas in addition to the EMF. Neutralization,
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.080]   that is definitely something I make sure that I change the time zones in a way that
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.280]   when I land that instantly there also the quantum upgrade is in a new time zone, if that makes
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.800]   sense. So that helps a bunch and then I then I leverage the new sleep. I don't know,
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.760]   it's not a sleeping rest. That's what it used to be called the common rest card and actually
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:56.800]   some physical supplementation, which I'm thinking about actually producing in a combined fashion with
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:06.080]   specific frequencies. That's 100% natural, no melatonin. It's a specific form of magnesium,
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.920]   then pharma, GABA, which is not from the pharmaceutical industry. It's actually the
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.960]   natural stuff and glycine amino acid and that's it. Awesome. Hey, that's okay. So that's another
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.200]   new product. That's not on the list, but oh, yeah, this is great. I mean, well, you're kind of like
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.960]   the poster boy of what you can do with quantum. I mean, just the fact that if for those of you
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.520]   who don't know, I mean, Philip became the number one national tennis champion for the United States
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.240]   in his age group in 2024. And this came from you not, you know, not playing tennis for like what,
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.880]   15 years and then a year and a half ago, you decided to start playing tennis again. And now
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.200]   you're the number one in the country. Yeah, you know, that's pretty wild, man. I mean, seriously,
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:05.200]   that's a hell of an accomplishment. Indeed, well, I do need to say though that the 15 years of break,
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.520]   that started when I was 18. And so I did not play in college. I frequently get asked, you know,
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.760]   where did you play in college? I said, I didn't play at all because that took a break for 15 years.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.680]   And if I look back to the last several years that were indeed two and a half years where I didn't
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.040]   play and last year in September, October, I started playing again. So that was still a significant
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.760]   long break. And then I started playing tournaments again in March. Yeah, and it was quite rapid.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.880]   You know, I definitely, I did not have that goal at all. I mean, I would have never thought I could
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.320]   make number one. I mean, certainly, there's a little bit of course, let's see how far I can take it
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.840]   and what all these biohacking tools and the quantum tools can do. But honestly, I mean,
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.720]   I would have not bet on it, not not more than 10 bucks probably. Yeah, it's wild.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.520]   Yeah, I mean, what you accomplish is wild. It's just, it's amazing. And of course, you know,
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.720]   you cure jet lags. So it's just, I mean, the amazing stuff just keeps happening over and over.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:24.560]   It's just great. I mean, it's great. So hey, okay, so let's get with the video. So 2025 new products.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.200]   So the very first one, if you want to go ahead and kind of share with everybody. Now, I kind of
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.680]   did my unboxing video and kind of shared the prototype that I got. But this is coming out,
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.040]   right? It's coming out January 2nd. Is that correct? Yes, January 2nd.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:48.640]   January 2nd is indeed the day. And there's a limited quantity that we will have at first.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:56.160]   But I think it should be enough for for most in the beginning. And it's, it's the super block. You
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:03.600]   know, we, yeah, I think you have that one. And you got it in, in the, in the square version.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:11.040]   Still, that was the prototypes we had. And we experimented around with that and actually found
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.640]   that this one really wanted to be in a round version. And then we tested that in it. Yeah,
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:27.200]   it turned out to be amazing. It's at 5,600 on the walk-in scale, which is unheard of. It literally
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:36.320]   is so much. It's such a high vibration. The, the character of this block is truly a healer.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.360]   That's what we found as well. So it instantly more than, more than we had an infinity block at
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.720]   some point that also was characterized more as a healer type. You know, this one is absolutely
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:54.640]   next level. It's literally, it, it focuses on that very quickly. As soon as you interact with it.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.040]   Um, so that's really nice. It does have a specific feature
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:09.040]   in regards to deuterium depleted water. It's not easy to explain how that works. But on a frequency
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:17.280]   level, it, it pretty much removes the, the deuterium or let's say the, the effects of deuterium in
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:24.800]   water. So it mimics basically in 10 PPM, deuterium depleted water on an energetic level,
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.480]   which is also quite phenomenal. We were not able, and I want to mention this here also,
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:37.120]   we were not able to remove the deuterium on a molecular level. So you would still have it there,
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:43.520]   but, but frequency and energy wise, it's, it's still the same. And we, we also don't have an
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:49.600]   answer for that at this point, why it's not removed on a molecular level. But it's, it's almost as if
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:58.240]   those specific molecules are, are sort of inactive, right? Then at that point, or don't have the
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.080]   vibration anymore. That's detrimental. So that's really nice. If you want to charge water, and
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.080]   certainly I leverage that if I, you know, when I play tennis, for example, I have the charged water
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:16.800]   with me. Now, what else is there to say? So not only is it round, it's, it's, in terms of the size,
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:24.240]   I think it's more or less 14 by 14 by 14 inches, but not square, obviously it's round. And it has
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:32.000]   only three rods, which is also new. We used to have four rods. Now it makes it really easy to put
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.880]   a big plate in there, for example, with big water bottles or jugs in there, you know, your
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:47.920]   cats or dogs out there, though, they may have it even easier to get in and take a look at. Those
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:56.560]   are the main differences. Oh, that's really, I mean, yeah, it's totally, totally digging mine.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:04.480]   And I'm going to do a video guys, because I've been sleeping in mine for a month. And the experience
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.760]   has been off the charts bizarre. So I'm going to do a separate video of what it's like to
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:24.640]   sleep in a grand block or super block. But anyway, it's just crazy. It's what's happened.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.800]   You know, anyway, so you know some a part of it, because I had to reach out for you for help.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:36.480]   Okay, so the character now, can you describe what you mean by character? Because that's not
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.120]   ever really come up before. Like we have all these different blocks, but none of them have been
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:47.280]   described as having a character, except for the original infinity block when it got up to generation
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:53.680]   four, you had said one time that that that character of that generation four was healer.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.960]   But we never really kind of like what really delved into like, what did that what does that mean?
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:06.880]   Yeah, I mean, that we're getting into realm that is very difficult to understand and to
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:13.600]   explain with words frequently. So I think before I say something, please everyone out there,
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.360]   you know, just take that in with your heart. You know, when I say that the character of this
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:26.880]   super blog is a healer, if you take it in that way, I think you can maybe sentence what it means
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.600]   way better than understanding what I would try to express now.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:39.840]   You know, it's it's a high consciousness field, right? And this high consciousness field is
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:48.560]   it's sort of neutral and it's in what it does, right? Because it's neutral pure quantum energy,
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:55.600]   but it leans towards super, you know, what it does always, these high consciousness fields that we
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:03.040]   work with and and provide they they neutralize and harmonize everything that's destructive or
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:11.600]   harmful to life and to consciousness. And they support pretty much everything in regards to life
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:17.280]   and consciousness that it that's what it always does. But then there are some nuances that we
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:24.640]   detected between the different blogs, not not huge, right? It's not that they're then
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:33.440]   completely different blogs, but they they lean towards supporting more this or supporting more
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:46.240]   that. And this one is it's just as if it it's nature to move everything towards quicker healing,
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:53.520]   if that makes sense, right? That's as if that's it. It's it's main quality in this regard. So it
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:03.280]   it operates quicker on that level. It detects these things quicker. It that's its main main
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.880]   and first focus, you know, that, you know, it does all these other things too, right? You know,
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.760]   obviously, it's sometimes hard with the brain to understand how such a field can do so many
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.920]   things at once, right? But it's certainly possible. And we may get into that today if we talk about
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:27.360]   some of the latest studies. But yeah, that's how I can explain it. Okay, no, that's cool. That's cool.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:34.080]   It's really, really special that you know that you that this has a character. I intuitively understand
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:40.720]   because I'm experiencing it. So yeah, that's that's totally cool. So now the the charging and
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.360]   copying times, you know, all that stuff is that going to be in the box on, you know,
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.080]   you're going to update the card. So I'll just I'll update the quick reference guide with all that
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:56.160]   all that information when it comes out. Yes, people are going to want to know, right? Yeah,
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:03.360]   of course, no, it will be on the website to my knowledge. And we have prepared a booklet that
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:09.680]   also will go out with these blocks. I'm not sure. So I don't want to make promises if it that's already
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:15.360]   ready to go on the second. I'm not sure, you know, the physical one. So it definitely will be
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:21.840]   available on the website. And so everyone will have the chance to look up the chart, you know,
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.000]   okay, what are the charging times, et cetera. Yeah, because I was going to update the quick
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   reference guide after this guy, you know, after this block comes out so that I have all the blocks
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.440]   and all the capsules. Okay, great. Okay, so speaking of capsules, the other new thing that's
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:42.400]   coming out is you've got four new products on the lay the quantum side. You want to kind of just
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:50.480]   chat about that and and and what what you're offering, starting with the woman's booster. Now
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:58.240]   you've created a petite, right? Yeah, so hey, don't you want to talk about that because that is actually
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:07.040]   your frequency. No, so it's so if people remember, you know, Kay created very early on a women's booster
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:12.960]   frequency and a man's booster frequency. And I think if I'm not mistaken, the women's booster
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:22.480]   specifically geared towards women over 30 slash 40. And, you know, supports in various
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:28.960]   aspects. And we've actually heard some phenomenal stories with this frequency, right? Especially
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:38.480]   also, you know, how do you call this now? So regarding the period, for example, that the pains
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:46.480]   would be less. And it's just much more smoother process, more energy. We heard even in the
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.960]   how do you how do you call that one? Well, I don't know how to explain it in English, but there's a
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.880]   phase that women enter as they get older. And then, you know, the period goes away. Yeah,
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:09.920]   menopause. Yeah, exactly, menopause. And so that is also a crazy time for hormone hormones that
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.480]   just go up and down. And it's just a difficult time for many. We heard a lot of great things. So
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:21.600]   that's the frequency. And what's new now is that we have this smaller version of it, which is not
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:27.600]   less powerful. It's important. Maybe it's slightly less powerful than the than the big version. But
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:35.520]   nowadays, if you compare the small version from today, with the big version from like half a year
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:41.360]   ago, the small version is actually more powerful, right? So there isn't anything less powerful. So
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.960]   don't think it's not powerful. It's very powerful. But for women specifically, it's nicer to wear
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:54.000]   for most at least. And also for kids, it would be, you know, in other frequencies and for kids. But
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.760]   because it's smaller, it doesn't wear heavy on the neck. And that was the feedback we had gotten
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:05.600]   from women. They always asked, Hey, could you make a capsule that smaller? So that's not available
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.840]   for this one, like it is already for the heel 360 as well. Okay, cool. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, just as a
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:18.000]   real just real high level, the frequency set for the woman's booster was something I created after I
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.160]   created the men's one for myself. And so really what it was designed to do was like, like, people
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.880]   of that are, you know, middle age, you know, we struggle with, you know, basically our immune
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:36.720]   systems and energy levels. And so I created something where it was five separate frequency sets
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.720]   that would combine together to be like one harmonious booster thing. So it helps with
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:48.240]   your brain function, it helps with your immune system, it helps with your stress. And of course,
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.280]   there's a hormonal aspect of it. So in the woman's, it's for women, in the men's, it's for men.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.600]   You know, and then there's this anti aging aspect of it as well, because as you get older, you know,
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:05.600]   once you hit 30, 40, 50, your body really just starts slowing down in producing all these things
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.280]   that your body runs off of. And so you need all that anti aging stuff. So that's really what the
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.520]   boosters all about the men and the women's boosters, but it's cool that there's a petite one now.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:22.960]   There now there's also new quantum charged items that are going to be on the site, right? So we
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.160]   finally, now you've always had the men's underwear, but now I understand you you've got a new woman's
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:34.000]   underwear. And that's what it looks like. Yeah, and frankly, I need to, I need to really tell
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.480]   everyone. So to our knowledge, this is the first EMF protective women's underwear on the market.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:46.000]   Well, why it? Well, maybe I'm incorrect, but we haven't seen anything anywhere, especially not in
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   the US. And we know actually someone that had worked on this for two years, and then she gave up.
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:18:01.280]   And she's actually excited that's that's biohacking Brittany. Oh, she wanted to launch these so-called
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:09.600]   Emphy's EMF underwear for women. And then they gave up because it's just difficult to do, right?
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.560]   Because you need to have the silver, but it still needs to be comfortable, can't be too thick,
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:21.680]   but it also cannot be thin, obviously, right? So I think we did a pretty good job in creating
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:30.960]   two different versions of that. So two different kinds. And not only is it naturally antimicrobial
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:38.400]   because of the high purity silver fabric, it also blocks over 99% of EMFs. And on top of that,
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:46.080]   it's charged not only with quantum energy, but also with the heel 360 frequency. So it's literally
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:54.240]   called the heel 360 women's underwear. And I find this super exciting. You know, women had asked
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.920]   also that they could have something and now we're the first two to offer it. So give it a try,
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:06.320]   everyone, and let us know what you think. Cool. No, that's really cool. Yeah. One more thing,
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:13.440]   sorry, I need to say that here also. So the like with the jackets that will, you know,
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:21.600]   the size is on the smaller size. So if you're usually a small, I would suggest you get a medium.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:28.800]   And if you're usually a medium, get a large and so on. Okay, good to know, good to know.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:37.920]   Okay, so now there's a new dog collar and new coasters as well. Yes, that is correct. So the,
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:44.080]   well, the dog collars, that's actually, they're not launching on the second already, but they will
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:51.360]   launch a little bit later, I think in the maybe mid month or the end of the month,
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:58.480]   okay, of January. And we will also have, now that we're announcing dog products, also
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:08.240]   a container that's specifically made for dog and cat food. It's a smaller container.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:15.200]   If people buy bulk or large portions of dog or cat food, they like to put it in containers
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:23.280]   in between because of the air tightness and everything. And this container will be a quantum
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:33.040]   container and it will also contain the positive frequencies for the animals. So that will come
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:41.280]   towards the end of January, I think. But indeed, the coasters are launching already now in the
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:50.880]   beginning of the year and the coasters have an even nicer design. They used to have the mandala
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:57.760]   that was closed. Now it's more open. Everyone that we've showed this to loves these new coasters
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:06.000]   and they are also charged with the original heel frequency. Oh, okay. So that is obviously quite
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.600]   nice for every beverage you put on, because it gets charged with all these important
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:20.080]   vitamins and minerals and the healing activation frequencies.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.280]   Okay, cool. So the dog collars are still going to be charged with the heel for dogs, correct?
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.400]   Yes, that's correct. And will the pet food containers have a frequency in them?
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:38.160]   I let's talk about it when we when we get there. Sure. I think that's that's better.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.000]   Yeah. Okay, great. All right. So we've got some definitely new products coming along. And then
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.600]   let's talk about new frequencies. So right off the bat, I only know of two of them. So
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:53.200]   if there are more, let's chat, but let's right off the bat. There's the new calm and rest, which
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:58.080]   was the outcome of the the frequency contest, the second one last year or this year.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:06.800]   So is it now so there's already a calm and rest frequency available. And now there's this new one.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:14.400]   So are you going to name the new one calm and rest and have like an original and a new or how
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:19.360]   how is that going to look on the website? The old one will not be available anymore.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:26.800]   So only only the new common rest frequency. Yeah, there's no point for us to keep two of those.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:32.800]   Okay, because it's it's literally it was meant to be the update of that one. And so now we have
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:38.080]   the update. So that's literally what it's going to be. And to my knowledge, this one will be
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:44.160]   available also in the beginning of the year. So on January 2nd, however, the brain support
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:50.640]   frequency that will only be available on the quantum upgrade in the beginning of the year.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:59.680]   And it will probably take us until now would say probably mid and January to also have the brain
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:07.040]   support frequency as a frequency card. We had to get the mandala created. The mandala actually looks
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:17.280]   awesome. I'm amazed actually by by how good it looks and how how much it fits the frequency.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:23.680]   But yeah, it'll take a little bit more time. Okay, can you can you kind of just share with us
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:29.120]   like the you know, like the new common rest, right? Like what was the the healer's network
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.640]   experience, you know, and you know, with that frequency in in terms of like how much better it
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.200]   is or how different it is than the original one. And then, you know, and just like what are
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.760]   people saying about it? Because no, you know, no one's trying to get except you guys.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:53.600]   So yeah, so first of all, for the ones that don't know, this was a frequency contest, right? So
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:24:01.200]   everyone was able to submit their their own frequency for for this. And then we went through
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:09.120]   all of those and we selected two winners. You were one of those. And we we we figured that
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:19.680]   yeah, this just worked amazing together. And then Roman treated
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:29.520]   there was a little bit of harmonizing needed to to make it ideal. And this frequency
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:37.920]   is it's so difficult to explain. I think it's not as much as a hammer as the the older one that we
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:45.200]   had. And with a hammer, I don't I don't want to discount the current frequency because it is very
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:51.600]   effective, but it doesn't come with a hammer. It's it's more smooth, but it's very effective. And,
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:25:00.720]   you know, it it helps you. I can't really say that publicly. But it, you know, it helps me. It
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:08.640]   helps me personally with falling back asleep and having a nicer sleep. And I don't really have
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:14.000]   sleep problems though. I must say, I mean, I leverage it now when when I have international
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:20.400]   travel to help mitigate jet lake and things like that. But it, yeah, it's it's very positive and
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:25.120]   smooth in that regard. And very powerful. And we like it definitely better than the old one.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:33.360]   Okay. And so I just want to clarify that, you know, the frequency is for is to basically help
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:39.840]   sleep, you know, people sleep as opposed to anxiety panic attacks, things like that, right? I mean,
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:46.000]   you can kind of take the word calm and rest in different contexts. So this one's more to as a
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.120]   sleep aid versus a anxiety panic aid. Would that be correct? I just want to clarify that.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:26:00.560]   Yeah. So I mean, for anything in regards to anxiety and then so on, I would I would probably
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:08.400]   move towards the inner peace frequency rather. Okay. Yeah. But this may may still be a good
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:13.840]   combination, right? So that at nights, you use this one and then, you know, during the day,
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:20.560]   you use a little bit of the inner peace. Yeah. Okay, that's a good idea. Okay. And then so you
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:27.280]   were telling me when we were chatting before the show about the remarkable results from the brain
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:34.160]   support frequency, and you know, when you guys went to run it through studies. Can you want
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:40.640]   to do you want to share some of that? Yes. What is this new? Like, what does this new frequency do?
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:48.000]   Is it for students or what? Yeah. Yeah. So it's well outside. Yeah. So that's it. So for everyone
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.840]   that's listening. So this is this is the probably the most exciting stuff that I've witnessed
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:03.440]   in quite a long time. And I've I've seen a lot. I've seen all these amazing studies that, you know,
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:09.680]   each time something like that happens, it blows my mind, even though I know it all works, you know,
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:16.160]   with ATP production, the wound healing, the blood and all of that, right? Yeah. But this one now,
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:22.960]   this one, we had never really done much with brainwaves, right? There were some first tests
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:28.240]   that were done that were positive, but but nothing more than that. And so it's a new field. And you
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:34.240]   go into this as, okay, we know it works. And this is what should happen. But you have no idea,
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:40.800]   really, right? Until it's finally tested. This went to an institute that works out of
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:48.800]   Switzerland and Germany. And they have the most advanced EEG device on the market. And I think,
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:55.360]   at minimum in Europe, we could not find anyone in the US that has a device like that. It costs
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:05.680]   about 140,000 US dollars. And as has 256 channels, it's absolutely incredible. And so the way they
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:13.120]   test is that you come in, you get a before test with with no electromagnetic fields. They have a
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:20.320]   room where there's no electromagnetic fields. Then you sit on this chair, like you can see here on
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:27.760]   the video, you get this helmet on also for the first test already, you get this little helmet on.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:34.160]   Then you have this lady sitting in front of the computer who's actually reading the EEG.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:45.760]   And you get a phone, an iPhone 15 placed next to your ear. And actually, this picture was taken
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:52.880]   when the phone was, it hadn't even started here, I think, because it was moved much closer. It was
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:29:02.800]   about, I would say, at most half an inch away from the ear. And then a 5G call would get started.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:10.800]   And they didn't talk, but it was basically the 5G connection call for 30 minutes. And then they
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:20.240]   would run this EEG for 30 minutes. Now, after that, we would place this person. And there were,
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:29.360]   you know, I think 12 test persons, if I'm not mistaken, we placed them into the quantum upgrade.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:37.520]   And then the whole thing started over, right? The phone would be placed there and they would run
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:46.320]   a 30 minute EEG. And the results were incredible. All the different areas of the brain got activated.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:58.960]   The negative effects onto the brain, which were rough, so rough. It's crazy. So this lady here,
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:06.240]   she is one of the top experts in Europe, in regards to reading EEG, she has done this for decades.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:14.720]   And there's no one that knows more about this than she does, let's say that way. And she said that,
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:21.600]   in regards to the brain, what these 5G frequencies do and other EMF frequencies,
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:31.520]   is they put your naturally occurring brainwaves into an artificial box. And then they just,
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:39.520]   do you have these brainwaves in a box? I mean, I don't want to speculate much about mind control,
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:46.960]   right? But it's something where it is all in a box. It's all in a freaking box. It's not
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:56.640]   natural anymore. So the brainwaves change significantly. And it's not good. And people also feel that.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:02.560]   Now, the interesting part is that the quantum upgrade with the brain support frequency
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:08.400]   was able to neutralize these. And she could actually, as soon as the quantum upgrade came on,
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:14.720]   she saw it on the EEG. Like, she could literally also tell us we knew energetically when it was
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:22.080]   starting. And she saw it on the EEG, the significant difference, right, in every regard. And there was
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:28.160]   even one of the test persons there, an older man who had a brain stroke, I think you call it brain
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:35.760]   stroke in the US, and about 10 years ago. And since that day, he had always crazy disturbances
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:43.680]   and disturbing frequencies in his EEG. And he had run to all kinds of different doctors and people
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:50.160]   to figure out what could be done to remove that and to have this be normal again. And no one could
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:55.760]   figure it out. Now, the quantum upgrade normalized this within just a few minutes.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:05.280]   And that was quite amazing. There were other things also that we picked up that would actually
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:13.280]   happen because, you know, the brain is such an integral part, obviously, of our physical existence,
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:21.120]   right? And if the brain waves suddenly work in optimal function, it has an impact on the whole
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:26.560]   body. And I can't say much more than that, because I need to be a little bit careful in what I say
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:34.880]   and how I say it. But I think you can read between the lines. There is stuff that goes way beyond
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:41.680]   the brain that is positively impacted and influenced by this. Now, I want to say that the study report
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:48.560]   isn't in our hands yet. So we will probably still need for another, yeah, maybe three weeks
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:57.200]   until we receive it. And then, of course, we'll share. But we already know that it worked tremendously
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:04.800]   in every test person, not just in a few in in every single one. And it was literally, you know,
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:10.400]   you turn it on, waited until, you know, how does the up to five minutes, right? It takes one to five
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:19.040]   minutes until the quantum upgrade comes on. And it was right there. It was right there, so visible
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:26.240]   and noticeable. Yeah. And it also they will actually have these pictures of the brain as well. That's
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:34.560]   what this device can do. They don't just measure, but they can also visualize the brain and what got
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:41.760]   activated and all of that. And yeah, it's it's quite phenomenal. Now they they were still
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:47.440]   they were speechless before that, when they started before they started the study, they said,
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:52.560]   I mean, if if if that is possible, that would be a sensation, right? I don't know if that's the
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:58.080]   right word English, but that's that's how they call it in German. Because they said this would be
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:04.560]   incredible. Right. And they they still thought it wouldn't be possible. Very quickly,
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:09.120]   they found out it definitely was possible. Yeah, you can you can you can
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:17.200]   basically affect a person's brain waves from a distance is not something that's
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:22.640]   traditionally accepted in modern science. You know, that's really kind of like the world of
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.120]   magic. But you're like, yeah, I can we can do all this stuff from a distance while you're watching.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:32.000]   It's pretty that that's just probably blows people away all the time. When you
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.720]   start doing these things, I can just imagine people freaking out just like because that's just
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:43.360]   absolutely not possible in the way they understand physics. But yeah, this is so cool. So, you know,
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:51.360]   I'm just curious. How long do you know how long the effects last after you're no longer running
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:57.760]   the frequency? Like, does it last for a day? Then you got to turn it back on if you want it, you know,
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:04.320]   but was anything like that looked at? No, none of that was looked at. So we won't have any data
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:09.840]   in that regard. I think that's still something to be explored. And it's it's I don't think there
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:15.920]   will be a simple answer. It's the same thing with, you know, how long does charge water say charge?
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:21.920]   Right? It's the same same answer. I think it depends. You know, you have a positive effect
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:29.200]   and that that lasts definitely for a while. And the kick starts, you know, certain positive processes
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:37.440]   and processes in the body. But how long it really lasts depends on how you behave afterwards,
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:42.960]   what you do afterwards and all of that. But it does have an effect that goes beyond just
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.760]   the session. I mean, we definitely know that. Yeah, now you make a good point because people
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.640]   ask all the time about the water thing. And my response is that, you know, water so easily
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:57.920]   overwritten because it stores memories that, you know, there's all depends on what happens
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:01.680]   to the water after you're done. You know, if you put it next to Wi-Fi router, it's immediately
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:08.080]   erased kind of thing. Yeah. And you know, we're we're mostly water. So, but yeah, you know, honestly,
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:14.720]   this this this frequency is sounds amazing. I just as, you know, let everybody out there know, I
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:21.840]   Philip gave me access to it early. I did try it for a week. I have an incredible story about
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:28.000]   trying it. It'll be part of my what happened to me when I slept in the block story. But yeah,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.120]   it was pretty wild. Man, that was that was wild. What happened to me when I turned that thing on.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:38.240]   So yeah, definitely. And I'm happy actually. So if people are interested in what I experienced,
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:42.480]   I mean, I'm happy to share right now if you want me to. Oh, yeah, please, because that's the
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.400]   whole point. I mean, for me, it's such a long story. I didn't want to shove it into this video.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:51.920]   You know, what happened to me sleeping in the grand block and also using the brain support
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.320]   frequency was pretty crazy story. But yeah, what how about for you? I mean, how did it
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:04.480]   work out for you or would it? Yep. So by the way, I'm wearing these, how do you call them air
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:11.680]   pods right now? And obviously, those are pretty detrimental for the brain and for the head,
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:17.760]   et cetera. I've charged them now with the brain support frequency, because we I mean, we really
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:24.320]   figured that this brain support frequency for the brain is so much more powerful than if you're
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:32.000]   just using the neutral quantum energy. And so that's just something to keep in mind for people.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.880]   It really is probably if you have the quantum upgrade on, obviously, with the brain support,
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:43.440]   you all set by this this stuff, then can impact you in a negative way. And the way I really feel
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:54.240]   it is when I turn it on, I become more aware. My I literally notice how my whole brain and all parts
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:38:03.840]   of the brain are leveraged in a way, it wasn't before. And I would argue that I probably already
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:09.680]   have a quite well functioning brain because I live super healthy and and all of these things,
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:15.840]   right? And I have the energy, you know, it's not that I'm starting being a very sick person,
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:22.720]   right? I'm starting already at a quite a good level, yet I see significant improvements. And
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:30.880]   if I set it on a booster, for example, and I've tried the 3,400 booster a few times. It's literally
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:40.240]   as if I can process so much more information. And it's multitasking suddenly on a super
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:47.200]   weird level. And it's not just the thinking aspect. So for example, I think this would be
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.400]   amazing for chess players. I think every chess player would have a significant boost. If you do
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:59.360]   any type of thinking work or you need to calculate something or do whatever, I think there it helps
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:05.440]   you a lot. But it's also about perception in the room, because it's not just the thinking part
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:12.000]   of the brain that's activated, it's all parts of the brain. So that you're calm, you're very
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:19.520]   where you notice the room around you in a very interesting and and and conscious way.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:26.080]   You can interact with multiple people. If let's say you envision a room with multiple people,
[00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.840]   let's say you're at a party, right? And so there's multiple people that are talking.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:38.240]   You're suddenly so much more alert with everything. It's it's quite incredible. I don't know if people
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:44.400]   have watched the movie Limitless with Bradley Cooper, that one comes to mind. You know, they
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.880]   at that, of course, it's completely different. They have this pill there. And then if you take this
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:56.000]   pill, it suddenly activates 100% of the brain. And then this guy is able to learn Chinese
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.520]   in a couple of days and learn to be an amazing piano player in a day and all these things, right?
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:05.840]   Of course, it doesn't do that, right? It doesn't go that far at all. But it's
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:13.360]   it goes towards that. The principle, I think, is the same, that you suddenly feel you're much
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:21.120]   more capable with with everything you're doing. And I'm very curious on what other people report.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:25.840]   So we've heard this from many people now and now you we kind of see it also literally
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:32.800]   in these brainwave studies. But I'm very curious what other people report and I can't wait
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:40.320]   to see the video when you talk about it. Okay. Yeah, I mean, it definitely has a healing effect.
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:46.640]   You know, that's for sure. That's what really happened to me. But I gotta try it twice because
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:52.000]   I tried it while I was injured and had really unique experience and I'm gonna try it again.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.560]   And then later this semester, I'm gonna be trying it on my daughter, boosting her at, you know,
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:05.440]   3400 and turning on brain support while she's taking exams. Yes. And just I just want to see
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:11.120]   because what I've been doing with her all the way up until now is whenever she's got exams,
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:17.040]   she just, she's really lazy about her dashboard. So she just texts me and says,
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:24.320]   I'm taking an exam at 1030. So I'll set her booster for 1030 and put her on focus, right?
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:30.640]   And then so, but now it's like, I want to try, you know, giving her the 3400 booster and putting
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:35.120]   her on brain support. And I just wanted to, you know, and see how that goes for a semester and get
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:40.880]   some, you know, comparison feedback from her. So yeah, she's my little guinea pig.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:46.720]   That's awesome. And I would suggest if she's open to that, when she has specific days where,
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:51.040]   you know, she wants to study for a couple of hours here now and then, you know, for example,
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:56.640]   leading up to the exam, especially in the week leading up to that. Yeah, maybe she can leverage
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:03.840]   the brain support frequency already then while she's studying and then, you know, crank it up all
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:09.280]   the way for the exam. I'm curious. Yeah, yeah. So we're going to be, we're going to be testing,
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:15.840]   testing on the kid. But yeah, no, this is really cool. So this is available January 2nd on quantum
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:22.480]   upgrade. Is that correct? Yes, it's going to be a part of the heel bundle, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:29.040]   And then also the all in one frequency bundle and that no extra charge, right? And then it'll be
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:34.480]   available on a card weeks later, right? Once you get the product ready to go.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:41.280]   Yeah, I guess about two, three weeks later. Okay, great. So now on still on topic on the 2025
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.800]   new products, these are there's three other things that we had chatted about in the last new product
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:53.840]   video, which was I drops the quantum diagnostic service and a master class. And I thought I'd just
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.960]   throw it on the screen for you to give an update just to let people know who are interested in
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:05.600]   and had been asking about these. Do you have any status on them? Yeah. Yes, definitely. So the
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:14.480]   quantum eye jobs, I don't have an exact status. But my guess is that either in March or April,
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:22.400]   we'll be able to launch it. So we've made some some progress there. And the issue there isn't
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:28.240]   really the product itself. The product is ready to go. I mean, certainly would need to be produced
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:36.240]   in mass, but that's not really the big issue. The bigger issue is the yeah, you know, how we how
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:40.880]   we sell it. And we talked about that before. So but we're we're working on this and it's definitely
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:49.600]   going to happen. And then the quantum master class, it's probably the certified quantum energy
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:59.040]   practitioner. And that's the course. And that one is ready. It is ready and it's pretty much ready
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:06.400]   to go. We just didn't want to overwhelm people and and also not ourselves by launching everything
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:12.880]   at once right now. So this will launch in January. So we we can rest assured and generate this will
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:20.480]   launch, but rather towards the second half of January. And and it's going to be quite exciting.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:28.480]   I'm pretty certain at this point that there will be a significant discount for everyone in the
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:35.920]   first 72 hours of this course. So you can become a certified quantum
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:44.640]   practitioner or quantum energy practitioner. And it's a whole course you go through. And then
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:50.000]   you will be able to not only help yourself better, but you'll also be able to help others better.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:45:00.960]   And we will also more working on this, have a section on the website where if you want to,
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:07.680]   you can be listed basically as a certified practitioner. And then people could find you
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:16.320]   if they wanted to and yeah, get help really cool. I mean, how many hours of course work is there to
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:22.960]   complete? Well, I mean, it's it's quite a lot because there's there's homework too, but it really
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:28.320]   depends. You know, I think there's there's people that are more advanced in their knowledge and
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:35.280]   expertise already. They can go through this quite fast. And then for the ones that really want to
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:41.760]   take their time to also do the specific meditations, you know, there's for every chakra, for example,
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:50.080]   I personally recorded specific chakra meditations. You know, you can take more time. So it's a little
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:58.160]   bit of a time span. It's not, you know, it's it's exactly 50 hours exactly 100 hours. It depends on
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.640]   the individual. And that's how we wanted to do it as well. Because everyone has a different
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:09.440]   type of knowledge and expertise already. And some may want to do this super quick and someone
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.000]   would really take that time. Okay, cool. Well, I'm looking forward to hearing about that.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.440]   Okay, so that's the eyedrops and the and the energy healer masterclass. And then the diagnosis,
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:26.800]   the last time we chatted, you were you were thinking end of 2025, or is that about still on track
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:32.480]   to have that service ready? So now with this one, you need to
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:40.640]   remind me what this was about because I'm on that one. Okay, you had mentioned earlier in the
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:48.720]   year that you guys were tinkering around with creating a side, you know, service with quantum
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:57.440]   upgrade that could do diagnostics, like basically energetically determine what kinds of issues you
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:03.040]   may have, right? So that you can then focus different frequencies on. So you know what's
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:09.280]   basically yes, things you need to work on. Yeah. And then that this would be a diagnostic something
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:14.320]   similar to several of the different software systems out there right now that do diagnostics
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:20.480]   versus on voice prints, but you would be doing diagnostics off of energy prints. Yes, 100%.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:25.280]   So I know exactly what you're talking about. I was just confused because it was written under
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:29.840]   the lead like quantum products. And I was like, okay, so what is it that we're planning there?
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.880]   We're not because this is a quantum upgrade feature. Okay. And and yeah, we're
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:43.760]   we're not far in with the actual diagnostics part of it. But I don't consider that the
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:52.160]   most difficult anyway, the most difficult for us is to actually find the frequency that is then
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:48:00.560]   individually geared towards the individual that takes the test in order to optimize
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:09.520]   everything for them specifically in that moment fast. And that is what we've been working on. And
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:16.640]   we've made great headway with that. So, okay, yeah, given that, you know, maybe,
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:24.320]   maybe by the end of the year, we'll be able to have this ready. It's a long development. Oh,
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:31.440]   yeah, technically. And, and you know, getting the diagnostics, right, and all of that, that's it.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:39.120]   It's a big technological task. But again, the energetically, the the most difficult is what
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:45.920]   we started with first. And that is where we're already extremely far. I've been a guinea pig,
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:50.480]   by the way, one of them. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, uh, basically,
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:56.080]   if they get it picks out there, let me know, you know, hey, just me anytime you need me,
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:00.400]   just throw me on the on the list. But no, that sounds really cool. Basically,
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:05.600]   I didn't realize you were working on frequencies to go with the diagnosis. So,
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:14.880]   that's pretty cool. I mean, the idea is really to so that you can get tested and let's say you have,
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:20.720]   I don't know, you have metabolic issues and these issues and all that, that not only do you get
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:28.240]   tested, but then you can actually get this specific freaking what whatever you need in that moment
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:37.520]   to to to heal as fast as possible, right? That you would get that. And then this would run for
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:43.680]   a week or two. And then, you know, it would constantly optimize again. And then you could
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:48.320]   do a retest and and so on. So that's, that's basically the idea.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:54.000]   You know, you are so far ahead of your time, because you know what you've just described,
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:00.240]   a quantum medbed, because that's that's the whole vision, you know, of the future medbed, right,
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:05.680]   that you just lay in a thing. And it says, Hey, this is what's your problems. And here you go,
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:11.360]   you know, and then zap you with whatever you need to kind of hear or, you know, address that issue.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:16.800]   And yeah, it's pretty wild, man. Yeah, it's, it's really wild, what you're building.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.400]   And I know it's probably going to work because every time you crank out something,
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:24.880]   it's just amazing. Okay, I'm really looking forward to that one, because I want to,
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.720]   once that comes out, you know what I want to test more than anything I've been wanting to test
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:35.920]   forever, is the ability to replace supplements physical with frequency, right, the supplements.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:42.000]   And I don't have a tool that can tell me how I'm doing, you know, they're, you know, so yeah,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:48.160]   but there's one person I know that that did that using a different tool, you know, to keep up
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:52.640]   dieting, you know, keep checking how they're progressing without physical supplements
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:58.000]   and then using frequency instead. So I definitely want, I need a really good tool
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.760]   to track how that works out. But I think I have a solution for that also, by the way.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:07.600]   Okay, how do you crack that nut? Because that's like one of the biggest questions we get,
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:11.680]   right? People ask like, Oh, now that I've got the neutral bio base, do I need to take
[00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:16.160]   supplements anymore? And I'm always going, yeah, you still need to take it because you're still a
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.760]   3D meat bag, you know, we're all still walking around with meat sacks. So
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:26.720]   but there are people who can survive off frequency. Yes, that is absolutely true.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:30.960]   And elevated energy, you know, they're they've elevated their consciousness to the point of
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:37.360]   them being energy being. So how do you crack that nut? Yeah, so you absolutely right,
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:41.760]   there are some that can do that. And I think that number will increase.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:51.040]   But for everyone else, we've figured out a way where you can combine the pure energetic with
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:57.440]   with some something physical. I don't want to really say too much, but there's a
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:06.000]   delivery mechanism. Just imagine you could let's let's take the original heal frequency,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.600]   right? That contains, you know, almost 80 different vitamins and minerals and organic
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:17.520]   plant extract. Let's take that one, right? So now you have that just as a frequency card or just in
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:24.800]   the quantum upgrade, it works well, but it's maybe the efficacy level is, I don't know, maybe between
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:34.480]   45 and 85%, right? That that's what I'm kind of guessing. If you then could take a drop of water
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:41.760]   that also contain this frequency is suddenly that moves up the ladder on the percentage scale,
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:48.320]   quite significantly. For whatever reason, we've tested this, it does work better. Now,
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:54.400]   just water wouldn't work though, because water doesn't hold a frequency long enough. So if we
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:53:00.800]   gave you, let's say just, I don't know, water bottle with this frequency, the frequency would
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:09.600]   be out of the water after some time, right? So now we have a special water now that can
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:21.280]   actually hold this energy pretty much for years and years and combine that with actual frequency.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:25.840]   And then you're you're pretty much right there where you describe where you want to be.
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:33.280]   Okay, okay. There you go. Okay, because I actually do water imprinting, I created my own neutral
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:41.280]   bio base and combined with anti-aging stuff. And so every pitcher of water, I run it through my
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:47.680]   RSO filter, fill up a pitcher, put it in my ground block with my frequencies for vitamins, minerals,
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:53.360]   and anti-aging supplements. And I charge the water and imprint the water, and then it goes in the
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:59.840]   fridge, right? And then I'll drink it like within a day. But it's just regular RSO water. Is there
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:06.080]   something you could do to the water before I try to imprint it? Is that what you're saying? Or is
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:10.960]   that like a product you're going to start selling, which is you're going to sell special quantum
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:19.840]   water or something like that? So think of salt. So now you may have the answer. You could you could
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:27.360]   use you could use a hypertonic, you know, sea water that's nano filtered, for example,
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:34.080]   because salt holds that information pretty much forever. You could you could go with
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:42.400]   saline solution, you know, things like that. Yeah, it's actually fairly simple. I mean,
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:48.480]   there's other ways to, you know, you know, how the tip, the, the globally, I don't know how you
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:55.360]   call them the homeopathic medicine, they come in these tiny little pills, right? Yeah. And so that
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:55:01.760]   would be also another way to do it. But in terms of drops, that's, that's what I would do. I would
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:08.240]   go with a nano filtered sea water. Okay. All right, I got it. Okay. So you need something in the
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:14.640]   water to imprint on. Okay. Because I've been imprinting on pretty much pure water. RSO does
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:19.920]   have some little bit of minerals. It's not as, it's not as clean as distilled water. But
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:24.640]   yeah, I get what you're saying. Okay. So we're going off on a tangent, guys, for you tinkers
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:31.760]   out there. That's how you can get off. You can tinker with replacing supplements with
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:37.120]   frequency of supplements. Wow. Okay. So that that'll be a whole new thing that we're going to try
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:42.560]   here. So in the future. All right, man. Okay. So great. That wraps up as now, is there anything
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:51.280]   else coming up in 2025 that, that I didn't get on the list? I think this is pretty much it.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:55.760]   Thank you very much for your time today, Philip. I'm going to get this out right away. Get people
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:56:03.280]   excited about the 2025. Oops. We got to update this with 2025 product updates. Also, what's coming
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:08.880]   out new for the studies as well as some Q&A stuff. So, but again, thank you so much, Philip, for your
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:13.280]   time today. I really appreciate it. Now, of course, everybody knows where to get ahold of Philip.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:18.880]   You know, get ahold of me if you've seen any one of my dozens of videos. So we'll just skip all
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:23.840]   that part and just say thanks and really appreciate your time and your insights, Philip. Thank you
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:32.080]   very much. Well, I want to say thank you to you, Kay, for all this amazing work and what you're
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:41.440]   contributing to this space. It can't be acknowledged enough. It's just absolutely phenomenal. The
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:48.160]   ideas you have, the value that you create for all these people that, for example, you're breaking
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:56.240]   down studies in a way that it's understandable and not just adjustable for the everyday person
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:02.560]   that's not usually trained in reading studies and science, and they may not even have the time
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:09.440]   to do that. All of this is just phenomenal. So I'm so grateful for everything also,
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:15.360]   for being so active in the community and a big apology. Oops. I think I lost my
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:25.200]   earstick here. Hopefully you can still hear me. So I want to apologize to everyone in the
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:33.360]   communities, by the way, also that I in 2024, I really haven't been as active in the communities
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:43.280]   as I had wanted. It's just been so much, you know, with everything going on, you know,
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:48.400]   separated from my wife crew, which not many people know that happened in February. We're still
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:53.040]   great friends, by the way, and we still show up at conferences together and all of that. So,
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:57.760]   you know, it couldn't be better on that level, but it was still a difficult time.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:04.480]   On top of that, all the work, all the travel, and then also the tennis on top of it, and having
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:09.760]   a dog that he was taken care of all the time. It's just, it's been impossible to do that,
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:14.000]   and also for the trauma easy community, for example, you know, I had wanted to
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:22.640]   actually, you know, set up these more or less regular webinars where we can talk about that,
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:29.920]   and maybe do some trauma work together, and all of that I still want to do. It just was not possible
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:35.120]   in 2024, and let's see that we can get something started at least in this new year.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:42.880]   But it's just, it's not that I don't want to. It's just been so much, and hopefully at least
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:49.040]   people see that everything is moving forward. We keep developing new stuff, and that for me is
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:54.800]   still always the most important that we, you know, do the research, and all of that, and have
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:59:01.520]   great products, and develop everything, and take it to the next level, and everything else comes
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:06.880]   after that. But yeah, that's what I wanted to say at least. You know, it's not that I want to
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:14.400]   stay away from the groups at all. No, you know, honestly, I feel comfortable speaking for the group
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:19.520]   to say, "Hey, you know, no worries, man." And, you know, you've had like so many others, you know,
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:25.680]   had a tough year, but you're really moving the dial. What you are doing is changing the world,
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:31.520]   honestly. I mean, it's a big statement, but think about it. I mean, you know, the fact that you are
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:39.040]   funding studies that proves that non-einsteinine physics exists, quantum energy, life force energy
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:44.080]   is part of our reality, and all of the things you could do with it, and providing people with tools,
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:50.240]   to help them, and also be able to help themselves, and help the people around them. I mean,
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:56.080]   yeah, it's to me, it's amazing. So, but yeah, thank you so much, and it'll be great to have you,
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:02.240]   if you have time in 2025, spend a little bit more time in the groups, if you have a chance,
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:08.160]   that's great. But I think everyone would just feel like, you know, supportive of you, and just say,
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:12.400]   "Thank you for everything you're doing." You know, thank you for paying out of your pocket
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:16.560]   for all of these studies that we all can learn and become better together,
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:22.000]   and that one thing you do about every product sale, man, you're still planting trees, right?
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   That's, I think that's something people forget about, but every time anyone buys anything,
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.240]   Philip hires someone to go plant a tree. So, you've got this whole thing going on on the side that
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:40.160]   nobody ever talks about, but I just think it's awesome. How many trees lay like you as planted by
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:46.400]   now? But anyways... That's true. Yeah. So, hey, happy new year. Yeah, it's New Year's Eve. So,
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:50.960]   happy new year. This video will come out. You all know what's going to happen on the second.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.040]   I'll get that out as quick as possible, and I just want to say thanks a lot. And if you don't mind,
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.760]   can you just hang on? Well, I'm going to stop the recording, but hold on for a second before you leave.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:05.600]   Absolutely. Thank you, and happy new year to you and to everyone out there in the communities.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.600]   Okay, thanks a lot. Happy New Year, everyone. Aloha.
