[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Hello everyone and welcome to another video by me, Kay Elmer and this video is on hydrogen
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.160]   water, specifically hydrogen water bottles and hydrogen water tablets.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.440]   My normal disclaimers are this is not medical advice, I'm not doing any product endorsements,
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.280]   I do not sell hydrogen products and I do not get paid to do videos.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.640]   So let's jump right in.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.440]   On March 9th, a guy named Steve from Hydrogen for Health put out a video talking about multiple
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.360]   different types of bottles and in the video he basically was talking about the idea that
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.720]   not all the H2 water bottles are the same and that's absolutely correct.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.920]   If you saw my first video about hydrogen water, I walked through the different kinds of hydrogen
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.720]   devices that produce hydrogen water and you know that's absolutely clear in his point.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.720]   In his video and there's a link below and it's a good watch is that the bottles that
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.640]   don't have that PEM membrane that I mentioned, they do create chlorine when salts are present
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.680]   in the source water and he goes through it in his video and he actually does all the testing
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.320]   and he shows you the results you know with the ones that do and the ones that do not
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.280]   have PEM membranes and that these bottles also create ozone with the implication that
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.760]   chlorine and ozone is not good.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.080]   Now why that he's making that statement and it's true is that hydrogen is created by
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.320]   running electricity through through the water using two different metal plates in the bottom
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.400]   of the bottles.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.800]   Now this electricity splits the water, the H2O into hydrogen, H2 and oxygen and that's
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.480]   how you get the hydrogen floating in the water that you drink.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.920]   Now some of them oxygen molecules actually form to combine O2 which is oxygen gas and
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.520]   you know so that's you got bubbles coming up and that's oxygen and hydrogen and also
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.920]   some of those oxygen molecules connect together form O3 which is called ozone.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.440]   Now here's the thing if there's salt in the water it will split into two and it splits
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.640]   into sodium, Na and then chlorine which is two chlorine molecules.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.640]   So that's the issue here is you know we're all doing this for our health.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.000]   We're doing C60 we're drinking hydrogen water and if you're drinking hydrogen water for
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.680]   your health you're probably not going to want to drink chlorine and you know this inconclusive
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.160]   if you want to drink ozone but I'm not going there in this video.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.800]   So the whole idea behind a PEM membrane is you know you have to spend more so like the
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.160]   bottles that don't have it run like 70 to 150 bucks but the bottles that do have that
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.080]   PEM membrane they start at 250 so you know it's a price difference and I actually bought
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.520]   the two cheaper ones you saw on the first slide.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.000]   So the reason that the PEM membrane exists and why it's more expensive is that the technology
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.880]   is basically this right here they put a membrane in between the two plates so that the hydrogen
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.280]   is isolated and then it ends up just being in the water that you drink and then the membrane
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.680]   kind of sucks up anything else so that it doesn't go into what you're going to drink.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.560]   So that's what the membrane done is it just basically sits between the two metal plates
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.760]   and kind of just keeps this other stuff from getting into your water you know to be as
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.680]   non-technical as possible.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.800]   But here's the thing alright is chlorine bad and so I did a little checking around and
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.320]   bottom line the EPA requires tap water this is just regular tap water to have detectable
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.320]   levels of chlorine it you know it's supposed to be there to prevent contamination and so
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.280]   what the EPA is basically saying is that the allowable chlorine levels in drinking water
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.920]   is up to four parts per million let's remember this number it's going to come up later and
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.720]   and that it does pose no known or expected health risks including an adequate margin
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.160]   of safety and that's what that's coming from the EPA and yes I know it's the government
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.160]   but that's what they're saying.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.200]   Okay now what about ozone so ozone is really an interesting thing when you when you go
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:54.280]   on the FDA website there's really and or the EPA they don't really cover it as a substance
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.520]   to drink but the FDA talks about ozone gas and then when it comes to ozone water in the
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.000]   water it's it's basically used as a disinfectant treatment and they don't really get into how
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.100]   much is allowable because the idea is when ozone goes into water it's going to be gone
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.800]   in 20 to 30 seconds it just just quickly dissipates just like H2 just dissipates really fast and
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.680]   so if you let's let it sit or it finally gets through all the pipes and gets to where people
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.880]   are going to drink it it's gone so there's really no required like there's no rule about
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.680]   how much can be because it just doesn't exist in the in the water supply but what's really
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.160]   kind of cool is that ozone isn't actually a naturally occurring molecule it's out there
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.800]   in the world and here's this little statement here in 106 years of continuous ozone use
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.520]   and thousands of municipal water treatment facilities worldwide no case of fatality has
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.800]   yet been attributed to ozone I got this out of a I think it's like an 18 page white paper
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.200]   link below good white paper if you ever want to read about ozone so what does this all
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.480]   mean okay well bottom line is you know chlorine is supposed to be in the tap water and ozone
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:07.480]   is not a big deal so what it comes down to now is when the video came out by Steve there
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.560]   was a lot of folks that and you know on on Facebook and well I didn't read that one but
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.520]   I heard about a Facebook thread that was going on and and on the Twitter side you know folks
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.280]   that are you know into this were kind of like hey what do we do you know we bought these
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.760]   cheaper bottles and I got money and do it I mean I personally have two of them I got $160
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.520]   invested in these bottles I've been drinking it like crazy and and then all of a sudden
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.280]   here oh man it's producing chlorine and oh what do I do with it and so everybody started
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.720]   chatting about well you know hey and so I wanted just to just to talk about the ideas
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.760]   that popped up on Twitter about these h2 bottles that do not have a pam membrane and so the
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.960]   the question came up was hey what is the best water you could use for that so it doesn't
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.040]   create the chlorine it doesn't have salt right and so the idea comes up is hey well what
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.480]   about purified what about spring water what about reverse osmosis water what about distilled
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.560]   water you know so what happens you know you know is it okay and everybody was like yeah
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.760]   you know some folks said yeah I don't you know here's it all comes down to does your water
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.640]   smell like the pool water right and it really comes down to that it because you could smell
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.160]   the chlorine in pool water and so like I could smell it in mine and I was kind of bumming
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.960]   for a little while because I had these you know these two bottles I just bought and other
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.160]   people were like I don't smell pool water when I use our reverse osmosis water other
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.160]   people were like I use spring water and someone was out there you know so let's just put this
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:37.360]   to rest so what I did was I did a test my test was I went and bought chlorine test strips
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.120]   and ozone test strips and so I'm just going to kind of walk you through what I did I basically
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.880]   got the test strips I got all three all four kinds of water I ran them through both of
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.360]   my bottles just to make a double you know double test and then I took the little test
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.200]   strips and I dipped them in the water per the instructions this one's the chlorine test
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.800]   and I was testing the strips I tested every single water with every two bottles and this
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.480]   is the the ozone test and as I was testing all of these and taking the measurements what
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:13.860]   I did was I was able to then come up with this and this was my test results and so for chlorine
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:20.020]   with purified water yes there was 4.0 parts per million but do you remember this from
[00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.180]   above well if you're paying attention in class right here four parts per million is
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.180]   what the EPA says is no problemo so you know it's kind of funny we're the highest number
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.060]   on the chart you know it's like okay well it's not don't worry about it right because
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.580]   that's what's in tap water and then the ozone was was greater than 0.5 is what the measurement
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:45.500]   came from the testing now spring water was lower than purified water purified water being
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.500]   I have a British bell or Birkfeld I use two of them with Dalton water filters on it their
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:55.260]   gravity put the water up here comes down here and so using that water and putting in
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.700]   the purifiers that's what I mean by purified water you know it came out the highest but
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.140]   it came out no worse than tap water and then the thing about spring water which was the
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.620]   avian spring water that I wouldn't bought you know it was a much lower after it ran
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:13.180]   through the bottles okay this is after the the cycle where you run it in the bottle and
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.780]   then RSO water which is reserved reverse osmosis water I'd actually go buy that too because
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.380]   I don't even have one of those you know came out were 0 I mean distilled in and RSO have
[00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.180]   0 and you know obviously you know there's no salt in the water that's what the filters
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.260]   do that's with distilled water so that's great I mean those guys it suggested that you're
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.540]   right on there is no chlorine if you're doing that and you're in your water bottle you're
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:39.340]   good to go if you're doing that and you've got you're using pure I mean I use purified
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.260]   water and there's still some chlorine in there I need to make the decision whether I want
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.220]   to put chlorine in because the whole point of preferring it for me was to get the chlorine
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.620]   out so I'm not sure what I'm gonna do yet but then here you go I mean you know this is
[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:57.900]   the result it's you're perfectly fine with spring water reverse osmosis or distilled very
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:03.020]   low if nothing in terms of chlorine and then I did you know measuring the ozone a little
[00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:09.260]   bit and purified a tiny bit in in in the other three waters but obviously there's really
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:14.180]   nothing to worry about so the conclusion is there's nothing to worry about with these
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.660]   three waters if you have this one and you're using just you know water out of your filter
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.820]   you are going to get a little bit of chlorine you may want to switch to these other waters
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.740]   or if you're not worried about it at your choice but these are the results so you can
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:32.220]   make the decisions I did all the testing for you so hey I'm just sharing you know like
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:38.180]   what I always do so there you go on that but so now let's talk about H2 tablets one
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.340]   of the things I first did right when I found out about it and I watched Steve's videos
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.060]   like oh it's bummed out really I have two bottles what am I gonna do so I just put the
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.980]   bottles on the shelf until I and then I ordered the test strips and while I was waiting for
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:55.340]   the test strips I switched back to using my H2V the water tablets and you remember this
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:02.380]   from my other hydrogen water video and so I was taking these H2Viva tablets and then
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:08.500]   I got a got a solicitation for this other new product called H2 Elite and it's an it's
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.460]   an H2 water tablet as well but I wanted to share this with you because it's really kind
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:20.020]   of interesting and so what what they you know what they promote with H2 Elite hydrogen
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:23.700]   water tablets is that they are groundbreaking new supplement for adding the benefits of
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.940]   high dose hydrogen water so high dose right now I was really interested in that I'm like
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:32.780]   you know just another H2 water tablet whoopee right but no no this one high dose and what
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.740]   really caught my eye was right here you can make it in an open non-carbonated beverage
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.660]   because you guys know that using H2Viva you put it in a bottle and it builds up that
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:46.660]   pressure and then when you pop that bottle open and I'm at work when I do this a lot
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.300]   man that thing just pops and fizzes and it gets water on my desk and it's kind of a
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.860]   pain and so I was thinking wow you can do this in an open non-carbonated beverage well
[00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:00.580]   that's pretty cool let's check this out so hey guess what I did I went and bought H2Viva
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.740]   to kind of test out and kind of compare it to H2 I'm sorry H2 Elite and compare that
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:12.100]   to H2Viva so I ran a test I actually got a substance called H2 Blue which is a hydrogen
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:18.020]   reagent that you can use to test the amount of hydrogen in water and so I went and got
[00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:24.140]   my test kit there I'm oh in the video I'm making my two different hydrogen waters with
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.300]   different tablets that's the H2 Elite now and you can see that it's in an open glass
[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:34.300]   of water a completely different way of making it there's my H2 Blue test kit for measuring
[00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.220]   the H2 content and how it works is oh right there this is what I want to point out about
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:46.420]   H2 Elite you see that right there the only weird thing about H2 Elite is that instead
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:52.380]   of the H2Viva which is a normal H2 tablet where all the magnesium sinks to the bottom
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:58.180]   with this new magnesium tablet all the magnesium floats on the top and it's just kind of the
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.900]   first time I did this I was like oh this is kind of creepy and it just was kind of gross
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:07.980]   you know this goo is on the top of the water but I learned that oh I'll just take a spoon
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.980]   you know scoop it up off the top of the water no big deal and then drink it okay now back
[00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:18.420]   to testing if the H2 Blue what you what you do is you have to do really quickly but you
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:25.820]   put the water in this little tube and then you just kind of drip the H2 Blue color reagent
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.100]   into the into the into the canister or the little tube there and and you see me with the
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:36.780]   little coffee stir stick you keep stirring it until the blue doesn't go away and that's
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:42.380]   pretty much it so you buy this stuff if you want to know for sure how much H2 you're getting
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:47.820]   for your dollar you can go ahead and test it and then you just keep putting drops in
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:52.220]   and then you stir you put a drop in and you stir and they keep going away and then right
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:58.020]   here about right here they stop going away and once the blue won't just go away real
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:07.380]   fast then that's when you know you have enough and enough means every drop equals 0.1 parts
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.940]   per million so you just count drops and so when I did the test and here are the test
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:19.780]   results for you when I did the test the H2 Viva it had nine drops so it's 0.9 ppm of
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:26.740]   hydrogen in the water that I use to you know with those tablets what was cool though was
[00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:33.100]   with H2 Elite you know it does what it says it's going to do I put 63 drops of the reagent
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:38.820]   into there before the blue wouldn't go away and which comes out the 6.3 ppm and so what's
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.260]   really cool and what I wanted to share with you because I'm always out comparing stuff
[00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:48.220]   and thinking stuff and testing stuff was that this new product out there is 60 bucks right
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:53.540]   you buy H2 Viva it's 40 bucks a bottle you know they both have 60 tablets in the bottle
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:14:00.700]   right and so this is what I wanted to point out that with the H2 Elite you get 600% more
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:09.140]   H2 per per tablet in a glass right for 50% more bucks and so that's a heck of a deal
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:14.980]   if you're really into the whole you know getting hydrogen into your body and you want
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.580]   the best way to do it and you don't want to mess with the bottle you know those hydrogen
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.660]   water makers you can use tablets okay and then the other thing that's really cool about
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:30.540]   using the H2 Elite is that you know it takes 20 minutes when you do H2 Viva you have to
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.500]   put it in a bottle you have to drop it in there seal the bottle up it takes 10 minutes for
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.660]   the tablet to finally totally dissolve and then you have to wait another 10 minutes so
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.980]   it takes you 20 minutes where you can drink it now with H2 Elite you put that in the water
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.980]   and it's gonna it's literally it dissolves in 3 minutes and then you can drink it of course
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.820]   after you scoop out the sludge on the top so once you scoop out the stuff on the top 3
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.340]   minutes boom you're drinking so the water stays cold if you know what I mean you know
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:03.260]   because it's sitting on your desk or something so I actually really like this H2 Elite product
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:08.260]   I wanted to share that with you it just came out just a few weeks ago so I went and bought
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:13.100]   one of the first bottles and and here you go there's my test results I actually recommend
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.540]   this one I don't sell or anything but I think it's pretty cool deal if you're doing tablets
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:23.740]   I'm actually out shopping for a new H2 water generator that doesn't make chlorine but that's
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:30.060]   250 bucks and all my kind of resources go to my C60 research so I'm not sure which one
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.740]   I'm gonna buy but I did want to share this with you and then also just before I leave
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:37.380]   I just want to say hey you know thank you very much I know your times are important so I
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.780]   want to jump off as fast as I can but I do want to share one little thing with you that
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:47.900]   did this morning that was amazing I I've been taking you know a new C60 product and this
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:55.100]   morning I I took a dropper under the tongue subliminally and let it kind of just soak
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:01.260]   in right and while while I was waiting for the H2 Elite tablet to dissolve so for three
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.180]   minutes it's under the tongue and I drank and then I immediately drank it so I had to
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:11.020]   take in the C60 and then I drank a glass of the H2 Elite at you know real high high potency
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:18.860]   H2 water and I was so energized from that I had never taken a punch of energy like that
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:25.260]   you know this whole time I've been trying C60 and H2 right it was it was pretty much
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.980]   you guys want to try something wild do that on an empty stomach and you'll know what I
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:34.060]   mean it's like all the energy you'd get from like three expressos but none of the coffee
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.620]   effects right so anyway that's kind of a cool story that happened this morning and
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:43.660]   I was pretty much wired for like six hours is crazy anyway hey you know thank you very much
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:49.180]   appreciate your time I again I appreciate your support and your comments and I love the
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:54.220]   questions I incorporate that into my videos and and I really really like your stories I've been
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:58.460]   retweeting some of them as people have been sharing I mean one guy's hair got darker
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.540]   another person they got more energy and they're at 70 years old but they feel like they're 40 I
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:08.460]   mean all this great stuff you know C60 and of course H2 so hey you know everybody thank you and
