[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Calmer and in this
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.880]   video I'd like to share with you five recent finds of supplements that you have some really great
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.560]   research and background well documented in terms of what they do and they were just some new ones
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.320]   I'd never heard of because like you're like myself, biohacker, health conscious, you know you take
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.040]   supplements and I take a lot of supplements and in fact I'm always looking for something new to
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.080]   try so I thought I'd just go ahead and share my recent five finds that you might find interesting
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.040]   that you might have never heard of before so let's jump right in hey. Okay so the first one is a
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.720]   find called, it's this supplement called oosnia and now this is really, this goes back forever and
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.960]   ever. It was actually been used in traditional medicine for a really long time, ancient Greeks
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.200]   used it. It comes from a light in that grows on trees, bushes, rocks and and soil of temperature
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.880]   of and of humid climates worldwide. Okay and so the thing about oosnia and this is really good for
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.560]   if you're you know it's flu and cold season obviously and this one's actually really good
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:10.240]   for helping with sore throats. It's great for reducing pain and fever so this is kind of what
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.240]   that was used for and so it's kind of a really interesting thing. I'm kind of keeping it in my
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.960]   cabinet in case you know I do catch cold and that sort of thing but the other thing too that it
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.760]   actually helps in weight loss and also in wound healing. So it's kind of a cool thing that I just
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.600]   found and I thought maybe you know hey you might want to be interested in it as well.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.360]   Now another one is called and this is a really tough one to pronounce the short name is PEA
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.880]   and it's pronounced polytolethonolamide and this thing is an endocannabinoid like lipid mediator
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.080]   if you understand what that means but basically it's an anti-inflammatory analgesic anti-microbial
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.440]   immobile immunomodulatory and it has neuroprotective effects and you know there's a lot of research
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.960]   on this one and so the thing that's amazing about this one is this one also helps with reducing
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.960]   pain and inflammation and joint health healthy aging anti-allergy you know it's really you know
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.040]   good for athletic performance and brain and cognitive health and gut health. So this is a really
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.240]   interesting one that's just popped up recently on the you know on the radar of things people are
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.640]   taking for you know supplements for health and so I thought this would be a really great one I've
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.840]   tried this for 30 days and I'm planning to give it another you know 60 more days to see if it moves
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.320]   a doubt. Now another one I thought was really great and this is this one falls into the world of
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.800]   prebiotics. Now inulin is a water soluble storage cycle polysaccharide that belongs to a group of
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.440]   non digestible carbohydrates called fruitans. Okay but bottom line though is you know a lot of people
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.400]   are all about probiotics you you hear that everywhere you know like mainstream you know marketing guys
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.840]   of really kind of just pushing probiotics but what you don't hear enough about is people taking
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.040]   prebiotics. So probiotics are the gut bacteria that you take that you kind of supplement your own
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.960]   and replenish the things that are destroyed through you know your regular lifestyle but then prebiotics
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.920]   is what feeds your healthy gut by you know gut microbiome. So you need to feed those guys. So I
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.520]   currently take a you know like a facility and husks I put that into my morning shake but one of the
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.400]   things that you can also do is take other types of prebiotics that feeds you know so you want to
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.040]   feed your little garden that's going on in your gut and so now inulin has been found to be really
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.000]   really helpful for that it's a great prebiotic and it really helps with things like constipation,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.880]   blood sugar control, obviously gut health, mineral absorption, appetite, regulation,
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.120]   and weight loss. So you know if you're interested in weight loss you know this is something that
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.000]   would really help you because it really helps your gut stay healthy. Now a fourth one is called
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.240]   fisoten. This one's popped up on the radar as a pretty amazing you know supplement. A lot of
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.120]   really good documentation on this and what this is it's a flavonoid and is found in fruits and
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.040]   vegetables and so forth. Now one of the things about fisoten is that the anti aging you biohackers
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.800]   might want to really pay attention to this is that they're really finding out that this is
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.400]   really helpful for anti aging because it functions as a analytic and what that means is is it helps
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.640]   your body process all of those cells that are kind of just kind of dying off in you because
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.640]   they just can't replicate anymore you know our cells replicate replicate replicate replicate
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.880]   and then your DNA gets a copy of a copy of a copy and after a while they just get worn out
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.720]   and they can't make any more copies you know that's why we all age and die basically
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.920]   but it helps as a analytic in terms of managing those senescent cells and allowing your healthy
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.280]   cells to thrive and that's why this is that the research on fisoten is pretty amazing so it's a
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.720]   really great anti aging it protects the brain it improves the outcome of people who have suffered
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.080]   strokes you know it helps prevent that malignant changes in cells to begin with and then again
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.200]   you know it helps fight obesity so this is another one including with Inulin in terms of helping with
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.280]   weight loss and of course you know if you have diabetes it helps you manage with that so fisoten
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.960]   is kind of like whoo this is a super supplement that's pretty something pretty interesting that
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.720]   something you might want to give a try now the fifth super supplement that I just recently kind
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.720]   of ran across is taurine now taurine is a natural chemical compound that occurs naturally in your
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.120]   body we just don't you know some of us just don't make enough of it but the thing about it is you
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.800]   you have sufficient amounts of taurine in your body okay then because you know you start to make
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.840]   less and less of it as you age right but what that what having a substantial amount of taurine in
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.920]   your body so heads up old people like me is that it helps reverse the aging in older animals then
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.960]   they're actually finding out studies that it's proving to do that so as you get older you make
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.760]   less taurine so supplementing it on a taurine in your older age your benefits include helps with
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:55.120]   diabetes and heart health and exercise performance and eye health and hearing and it has neuroprotective
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:02.320]   effects and it helps with your liver so you know these are five really kind of cool you know oosnea
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:11.200]   I'm not pee inulin fisoten and taurine that are five new supplements that I'm trying and I thought
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.600]   what's really cool I just wanted to share it with you and you know I included the prices and there's
