[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   the traumise questions, recent questions collected in March, just number one, Phillip, if we have
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:15.040]   traumisee, can we write out an intention and put it close to our phone? If left close to our phone,
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.200]   would it charge it? I guess charge it. Would you make it a little bit bigger, please?
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.440]   Oh, sure. Sure. For me, it's easier for me to also read it.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:37.680]   So it doesn't really work that way. So if you want to work with intentions, maybe there's a
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.280]   little bit of a benefit, but honestly, we haven't tested it. And from my observation,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.360]   that's really something you want to use the block for. Okay. All right. Number two, if I get traumisee
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.520]   on my phone, would my quantum block be damaged, upgraded by having the phone in it while traumisee
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:05.360]   is active? No. Okay. No, we're going to start number three. I have been finding working working
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.680]   with traumisee script cumbersome. And it brings me too much into my head. Today, I simply said,
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.520]   please harmonize these feelings and please harmonize these soul contracts. And I felt it instantly go
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.560]   into action. And so has anyone else found any shortcuts? And so I guess I just want to I put
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.440]   that in there because I just wanted to get your comment about that statement.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:34.000]   Yeah, from all perspective, that does not work that well. You know, it's you can you can probably
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.160]   get benefits. But if you really want to go through it and release it all, you have to do it in a
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.000]   different way. And you actually should not at all forget the awareness part of it, right?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.760]   That is just so absolutely crucial. Because if you energetically solve a trauma, you can get it back.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.840]   You have to have the awareness of it. Like, why did this happen? And then you understand,
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.680]   and then you realize, and then you understand also what you sold now once you to actually do
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.000]   or how to act moving forward. And when you have that, then you are done. And you're not calling this
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.480]   trauma in ever again. That's pretty much how it works. So yeah, it's a nice thing here. Nice try.
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.640]   And I'm sure it creates benefits. But we're not about just creating some benefits, but to
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.040]   actually release these traumas fully. That's what this is about. Cool. Okay. Okay. No, that's
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.240]   good to know. Glad I asked. Number four, can you use trauma easy if you don't really know the exact
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.920]   trauma, but know the same patterns happening? Yeah, you know, the more you know, the better,
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:53.040]   but I think I've posted about that once or twice before that you can just grab these patterns,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:05.120]   for example, the the topic or issues related to me always becoming fearful when I'm in high altitude.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.400]   As an example, right? If that's always, if that's the theme, then you could just name that,
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:22.160]   and then all traumas, bound energies, and attachments in regards to this, right?
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.760]   This pattern. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. That makes sense. Okay. So number five,
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.120]   I think you answered this, but if I get trauma easy, can I just receive the energy and allow it
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.760]   to work through my system itself and just leave it on or must I actively do things?
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.000]   Okay. That's that's a different way of wording that other
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.040]   questions. So yes, you need to actively follow the steps. Number six, I have a question about
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.800]   the Bovis levels mentioned for trauma easy. How is this tested to measure Bovis units?
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.840]   Bovis units can only be measured energetically. There's no scientific tool that can do that.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.160]   So like dowsing muscle testing. Pretty much. Yeah. Okay. So that would be one way.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.560]   Yeah. Study up on how to measure Bovis units. Okay. So no devices. All right.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.040]   Number seven, what guidance do you have if someone is having a hard time feeling emotions
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.640]   related to the trauma? Based on the instructions, this is an essential step and would love guidance
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.080]   if I'm not able to conjure up the emotion of the trauma.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:33.920]   Yep. Well, if you can at least try and open yourself up to that, that's that's a prerequisite.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:41.280]   If you can feel it, that's still okay. Right. And then there may be something that blocks that
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.080]   and then hopefully throughout the process, you get more and more access to it. And you may feel
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.600]   it in a different way than right. You may not feel it as specific emotions, but you may feel it as
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.320]   tension in the body, for example. You know, that's one thing that I noticed quite a bit. So when I
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.840]   when I ask for these numbers from zero to 10, for example, usually for me, and I can feel emotions
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.080]   go into emotions and all of that, of course, and I'm pushed that away. But the one thing
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.560]   that I always have to determine these numbers, for me, it's the tension, you know, the tension.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.200]   Well, I just know it, but there's there's usually a different level of tension within the body that
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:35.120]   I can it's energetic, but I can feel it physically. Okay. Okay. So number eight is a similar question
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.760]   as above, but for unconscious trauma. So that's sort of the same thing, right? I don't feel any
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:48.080]   emotions. It's or and or it's unconscious, but I guess your advice is to still try and then give
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.920]   it a name, right? So you're set. So the giving it a name sets an intention
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:00.400]   onto that thing you're trying to come up with and then focus on that thing. All right. Correct.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.720]   Okay. Nine, if you want to release an emotion, when are you going through step five? Should you
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.720]   focus on just one memory of that emotion or let your mind wander through lots of memories of that
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:21.280]   emotion? There's no recipe for that. You know, you don't have to do either one. You don't have
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:29.120]   to go into any extreme, but just what is available to you in the moment, right? So if if indeed all
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.840]   these different emotions are coming up, yeah, then you're you're allowing that to happen. If it's
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.800]   just one particular one, then you know, you don't want to shut off other ones, but then just work
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:50.160]   with that one. Work with what's there, you know? Okay. Okay. Number 10 for ancestral trauma,
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.040]   do you go through the steps once to heal all ancestral trauma, or do you have to go through the
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.360]   steps to release each type of ancestral trauma, i.e. one time through the steps releasing
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:10.080]   inherited anger, then another time for inherited depression, etc. Yeah. Each type of ancestral trauma,
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.120]   indeed. Yeah. It's not really possible because there's so many different things, and we can get
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:21.600]   things from our mother, from our grandfather, from our father, and what have you. So, yeah.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.520]   Yeah. Give each one a name and one at a time. Okay. Is there number 11? Is there a recommendation
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.360]   for using frequencies via the quantum upgrade when using traumesee?
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:38.400]   There's no recommendation. It's pretty much what I said earlier in regards to that one
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:45.360]   other question that was very similar. Okay. So, yeah, no real recommendation, but don't hesitate to
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:51.440]   tinker and see if something works for you. Okay. Now, should we turn QU frequencies off when using
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:58.960]   traumesee, or is there-- You don't need to do that. So, I mean, I personally don't do that,
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:11.120]   and I have not noticed anything that would indicate that I should turn it off in the future. But
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.600]   it's a possibility. It's more like how you feel about it. Okay. If you feel, I should just rather
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:23.360]   put it on neutral, then go do that. And if you don't have that, just leave on what you have.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:29.360]   Okay. And I'm just thinking out loud, but you probably would not want to be doing a boost
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:36.080]   while you're trying to meditate through traumesee, right? Like boosting is like the Olympic
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.600]   frequencies. Just like, you don't want to have like a drink of espresso. Yeah, you're trying to
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.080]   do something energetically. You don't really want to slam down a couple of expressos right
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.680]   before you do it. So, okay. So, yeah. So, I'm thinking don't boost, don't using Olympic
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:58.480]   frequency when you're trying to use traumesee or Vax harmization. Okay. That just makes sense.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:05.760]   Okay. Now, 12. How many traumas are recommended to release in a day? Great question. 100.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:15.680]   Minimum. So, no. There is no right number. And I would say it really depends on you and
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:24.560]   on the day, right? In general, I think, and that's just me, right? For me personally,
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:30.560]   I don't think I could work on more than three on a day. And then if it's something really,
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:39.200]   really super heavy, one would be the max for that one day, even if it's like a really heavy thing.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:48.080]   Because that takes energy, right? It's an effort. It's, you know, and as beautiful as it is, right?
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:54.160]   It's some work. And we tend to forget. It's like, you know, I also don't play three tennis matches
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:10:03.120]   in a day. But I probably could. So, you know, with traumas, you can do three at most from my
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:11.680]   perspective. If it's very heavy, one more than maybe a second one. And that's probably it in
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:19.600]   regards to traumas on a day. And then rather, relax and go ahead again next day. Okay. All right,
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.480]   that makes sense. Number 13, I think you've already kind of answered this, which is how long does it
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:30.560]   take? And so, you know, to get to zero from 10, it really depends on the trauma, right? It really
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:35.520]   depends on the person, right? There's no, there's like, no, no number you're going to throw. There's
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:40.320]   no, oh, that every single trauma takes 10 minutes kind of thing. It's just however long it takes.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:47.760]   Would that be the answer? Yes, that's very true. And it has taken me 20 minutes. It has taken me
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:57.920]   five minutes. So it can really vary by topic and also how alert are you in that regard also, right?
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:07.760]   So you may notice that if you do this when you're very tired and not, you have a hard time focusing
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:15.280]   on this, it takes way longer than if you're a little bit more alert and you can actually
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.960]   a lot of focus on this and stick with it. You know what I mean? Because you don't want to
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:25.840]   wander off during this process. If you start thinking about, I don't know, you're a girlfriend
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:33.600]   and whatever you need to do at your job during the same time, you're concentrating and focusing
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.720]   on a different type of energy. And then this thing cannot really properly work through.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:45.360]   So you want to stick with it and sticking with it, by the way, it does not mean at all to hold
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:51.040]   onto that trauma. You know, you actually stick with it while you're trying to let go. If that
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:57.440]   makes sense, that is the two things that you want to be able to do. Okay. All right. There's another
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.760]   question here that says, how does trauma Z work at night? But they're asking, can it potentially
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.840]   disrupt sleep? But as you read the rest of the question, it's really like, what's the best time
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:12.160]   of day? So you mentioned to me in our other tutorial that the best time was, or I guess,
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.200]   right when you wake up is so like, so what's your recommendation for what's the best time of day?
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.120]   Right. I think it again, it depends. I mean, I cannot even say that is the best time that is,
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:29.120]   I've found that for me personally to be a really good time when I wake up and I do have the time
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:36.400]   to do it. Or let's say, in some cases, actually, I usually have great sleep. And but if I don't,
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:42.240]   and I wake up, I don't know, at four, four, 30, and I feel like, hmm, I'm a little off and I would
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:47.840]   love to continue to sleep, but I kind of realize that I can't. Well, why not work on a trauma?
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:53.520]   Maybe there's actually a trauma knocking at the door saying, hey, I want to be looked at. So why
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:58.640]   not just never is that time? And then you have something to do with it. Actually, you're needing
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:04.640]   to do much. I found that to be really great to do that in the mornings. But other than that,
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:10.640]   it's really up to you. Maybe if you have a hard time falling asleep, maybe this actually helps
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:17.360]   you with that to release a little bit before you fall asleep. So I think, yeah, this is for me a
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.560]   good time, but I think everyone is a little bit different. And just just try it for yourself and
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:28.720]   feel what is good for you. Okay, no, that's great. Number 15, could workers and animal shelters
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:36.080]   apply traumizi and the steps to the to animals? Yes, they can. Okay, yeah, I think we covered that
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:42.000]   in the other tutorial using it for pets. Number 16, will the quantum field, the ability to charge
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.720]   and frequencies extend outwards like normal if the phone is sealed in a fair day pack bag?
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:59.040]   Yes. Same with QU. The fair day, the fair day pack bag doesn't do anything. Metal, mylar bag.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.360]   Okay, same thing with a QU, right? It's just it doesn't matter. These, these, they don't block
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:09.040]   the energy in other words, right? Okay, correct. 17 is the trauma that is being resolved primarily
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:15.440]   emotional, energetic with physical manifestations, or can it also support resolutions of primarily
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.560]   physical traumas like maligned injections, metal heavy metal poisoning and accidents.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:27.120]   That kind of can definitely can definitely help with that, you know, to to harmonize the
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:32.640]   the energetic issue of that. And then you may actually feel that
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:40.080]   physical results may ease afterwards. We need to be careful on how we phrase it. You know,
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:47.920]   I've seen it firsthand, you know, with me actually, you know, I had a huge back issue with a pinched
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:55.120]   nerve and an inflamed nerve. And the pinched nerve is quite crazy because there's not much
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:03.120]   like physically you can actually do. And so in the end of the day, it was all energetic that
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:13.280]   really made the huge difference. And yeah, so there can be trauma that can be worked on,
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:19.280]   and then you actually see some physical things change, you know? Okay, okay. Well, I'll tell
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.240]   you what, I just read the last two and I can handle that in my own, on my own. I know you got
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:29.920]   a hard stop in four minutes. So hey, I just want to say thanks, Phillip, for taking some time to go
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:35.360]   through the traumasie questions. I guess we'll continue to collect questions and kind of routinely
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.720]   do these things if we can't answer them ourselves in the chat group between them and myself and
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:46.480]   any other members who are helping out. So anyway, Phillip, thank you very much for helping on the
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:52.560]   traumasie questions. Any, any parting advice for the folks out there exploring new worlds and
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:16:01.360]   new civilizations with all of these new services? Yes, well, first of all, big thank you to you again
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:07.440]   and thanks to Emma and thanks to the community as a whole. And especially in these next, I think,
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:14.880]   few weeks and probably month, you know, there's just a lot that's going on, you know, in the world,
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:23.360]   and a lot of things that will disrupt things, a lot of, you know, wake up calls that are going to happen
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:30.800]   to everyone and the ones that are already using such tools and all of that are many steps ahead of
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:40.080]   the ones that are still very closed off and don't even know that they may have some traumas or that,
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:48.320]   you know, they are just in a very low consciousness level. So it's way easier for you, but as things
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:54.320]   come up, remember, if something out there is stressing you or it's, you know, getting you into
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:01.280]   lower vibrations, try actively to work on getting into higher vibrations again and just use these
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:09.840]   tools for you and, you know, maybe help others as well. And I think that's something we'll be seeing
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:17.120]   a little bit more over the next few weeks and months that stuff is out there that we may not
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:25.520]   understand, but we can deal with it. Okay, good advice. Thank you very much. All right. Well,
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:30.000]   I know you got to run. So thank you very much. And hello, everybody. And, you know,
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.600]   if you got to reach us, you know, where to find us. Take care. Thank you.
