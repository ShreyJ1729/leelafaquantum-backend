[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinker's Academy video.
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.360]   I'm your host, Kay Almer, and this video is another installment in the video FAQ
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.120]   series. Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech and quantum
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.520]   upgrade. This video in particular deals with the frequently asked question on how
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.640]   do I, you know, choose the right block for me, you know, because there's five
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.840]   different choices now. So if you've made that decision that, you know, you want
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.600]   to bring that positive energy into your home, but which block would be the right
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.280]   one, then this is that video. So let's just jump right in. So now the five choices
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.680]   that I mentioned for the different blocks that are now available. This is as of
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.560]   January 2025 is the in this order right here. I'll just kind of give you the
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.560]   picture right here is the quantum block. And that was the very first one that
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.560]   was ever sold. And then since then they kind of created a little tiny one called
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.200]   the travel block. And then this guy up here, which has got three plates on the
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.800]   top and bottom is called the infinity block. And then they came out with this
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.760]   big square one here called the grand block. And then most recently this month
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.360]   in January, they released a new block called the super block. And so now you're
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.480]   looking at these five choices and you're wondering, well, you know, which one
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.040]   should I get? So, you know, it's a great question. So let's talk about what are
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.760]   the features. So if you understand what the features are, there are some blocks
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.560]   that have special features, which kind of comes into play in trying to make this
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.520]   decision, you know, at least for my opinion, right? So now that the basic
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.920]   features for every block, all five of them, is that they all mitigate emf. And when I
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.080]   say mitigate, if you look at the studies, the effect of mitigation is on the
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.400]   biological, you know, organisms, pets, people, plants that are in proximity to
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.680]   the block. Okay, so the effect is on you, your body. And so there's all these
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.000]   blood microscopy studies and bio energetic studies and so forth that you
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.920]   can go and look at because they've got over 60 studies now. But you can
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.320]   actually see the actual physical biological effect that's happening on
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.920]   your in your blood from exposure to, you know, basically emf, you know,
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.880]   Wi-Fi cell phones, electric vehicles. And then you could see what happens when
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.480]   you're in when you're near one of these blocks, and how it completely just
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.920]   kind of erases the negative effects that show up, plus actually return your
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.160]   blood to a more healthier state than even started with. So that's that that's
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.120]   what the emf mitigation concept is. And it does that it's been proven with
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.160]   multiple studies. So all five blocks will mitigate emf. So if you're in the
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.560]   presence of one in close proximity, then definitely you're going to get the
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.760]   benefits of that emf feature. Now the other feature that is available for for
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.920]   the five blocks, it's not available for the quantum block is a feature called
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.160]   harmonizer harmony feature. And what that basically means is when they after
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.680]   they made the first block and they started making other blocks, the other
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.200]   blocks were stronger and stronger and stronger in terms of the level of
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.400]   energy. And that level of energy would sometimes cause people to get a
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.680]   little anxious nervous. It was just a lot of energy for people that just weren't
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.080]   used to quantum energy. So they developed a feature in all the future blocks since
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.800]   the quantum one, where they where the energy would then harmonize the block
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.280]   actually puts out an energy. And this energy then harmonizes with your own
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.360]   bio field so that it doesn't make you jittery. And in other words, you and train
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.920]   with that energy a lot better. It's a lot smoother. It's a lot easier on your
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.640]   bio field and so that it just kind of keeps it from
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.800]   overwhelming people that are new to it. And that's what the harmony feature is.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.440]   And the quantum block being the first one that was ever created
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.800]   doesn't have that feature. And it's not really that strong. It's
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.600]   in terms of its quantum energy strength. So it didn't, you know, it never had
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.880]   that feature and it still doesn't today. Now the other thing that these blocks
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.360]   can do is they can charge other objects. They can charge people,
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.320]   plants, pets, and they can charge locations. They can charge
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.600]   supplements. They can charge anything you put in them. And what I mean by
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.760]   charge is it can take that quantum energy because what all of the blocks
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.960]   essentially do is they basically concentrate quantum energy otherwise
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.400]   known as life force energy, Chi, Prana, you know, whatever you want to call it,
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.960]   the aether, but it can take that energy that we all know exists, right?
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.040]   And it can concentrate it like and and the way that the owner
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.200]   kind of describes it, he calls it like a consciousness sun. And so it's this
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.560]   conscious energy that's concentrated in between those plates.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.880]   And then it also can then amplify because it concentrates, then it just really
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.560]   draws in that energy. And then then that energy then can then
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.640]   broadcast outwards. And so what these blocks do is they concentrate it. So if
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.080]   you put anything between the plates, that whatever you put in between the
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.800]   plates is going to pick up that energy. It's going to increase
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.480]   its quantum energy of the object, person, people, whatever, right?
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.920]   Whatever you put in there. And then at the same time, because it's so
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.000]   concentrated, it broadcasts that energy out into its field.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.840]   It has its own energy field. So it can charge stuff by putting stuff
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.640]   between the plates. The other thing it can do is it can
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.880]   copy frequencies. And this is by far the most
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.000]   incredible feature that these blocks do is that they can copy a frequency
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.600]   of anything from one thing to another. So the idea here is
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.520]   if you put let's say, you know, let's say your favorite supplement, you put your
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.040]   favorite supplement in a block, and then you put a
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.160]   glass of water in the block with the supplement, the copy of the frequencies
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.920]   of that supplement will then imprint onto the water. And then when you
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.960]   drink the water, you're getting the frequency of those
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.200]   supplements in the water as you drink it. And so that's the idea. It can
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.480]   actually, you know, literally copy a frequency from one thing to another.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.840]   And that's way cool. And there's a whole bunch of tutorials
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.560]   all about that and a whole bunch of other stuff. If you want to learn more
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.480]   about copying frequencies. And the last thing is that there are some special
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.520]   features, as I mentioned before, and that there's three of them that have
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.520]   special features. The three special features are, now again, I
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.600]   just want to go backwards here and reiterate, all of them will emit
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.760]   quantum energy. All of them will be able to mitigate EMF.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.120]   Four of them will be able to harmonize with your own bio field.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.360]   They'll all be able to, you know, copy, you know, frequencies back and forth
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.880]   and charge stuff. But these three other blocks, the quantum block,
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.960]   specifically, its special features that it cannot overcharge.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.640]   And I did a whole video on overcharging and the copy effect.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.520]   But the whole idea is that there's a certain amount of time
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.960]   that you want to put stuff in the blocks. And if you put it in there too long,
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.840]   it picks up too much energy so that it has the potential
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.280]   of copying its frequency onto other things. So,
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.000]   having a quantum block that does not overcharge, that cannot overcharge,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.080]   because its energy level is low, is really good for,
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.200]   I'll get into why that's a really good feature.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.600]   And then the other feature that's a really unique one, and this is by far the
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.160]   most amazing feature, is that the infinity block was specifically
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.520]   designed to be able to upgrade itself. But you need two of them.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.040]   So that's why they sell the infinity block as an infinity block, or you can
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.440]   get the quote package. If you get the package, you get two of these things.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.920]   And what you can do is you can put one in the other,
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.040]   and then charge them. And you can go back and forth and back and forth.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.960]   And you can literally upgrade the energy level of these blocks to
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.560]   quote infinity, because there's no ceiling on how much,
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.880]   how strong these things can get. So, if you're someone that is really
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.480]   adamant about, you know, raising your own personal vibration,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.680]   if you know what that means, and you want to take it to where,
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.760]   you know, infinity and beyond, then the infinity block is something to
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.560]   consider. Because it is, it is the only block that
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.120]   is designed to be upgraded to infinity. And then lastly, the newest block is
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.680]   called the super block. And this one is very unique as well.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.680]   It has two really unique features that are different,
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.200]   you know, they're special on top of the other, you know, the standard features.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.640]   And that is that the super block is, is by far the most powerful healer block.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.880]   It's just the way its energy is emitted, the way that, you know,
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.120]   it's just its energy signature, I guess is the best way to say it,
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.120]   is that of a healer. And so, if you're, if you're into,
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.000]   if you're an energy worker, if you're a healer, if you're in the Reiki and all
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.840]   these other different practices, whether it's Chinese, Ayurvedic, whatever,
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.040]   then this block is something you really might want. If your
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.600]   thing is helping people, you know, pets, then this block is really kind of
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.720]   designed for that, the whole idea of quantum healing.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.960]   Okay, and then the other thing that this block is special about
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.280]   is it actually will emit the, you know, in part the frequency of
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.520]   deuterium depleted water into whatever water source there is. So,
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.480]   it could, you know, if you want to like, let's say if you're into imprinting water,
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.960]   as I described earlier, then if you just put water in this block,
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.800]   it's going to pick up the, the frequency of deuterium depleted water.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.720]   If you put yourself in there, then the water in your body
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.080]   will become, will actually pick up that energetic
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.000]   signature of deuterium depleted water. It's not a physical thing, it's an
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.120]   energetic thing, but it really works at that level
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:33.120]   in terms of trying to lower the, I guess the overall, you know, energetic
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.600]   footprint of deuterium in your body by, you know, charging yourself in this
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.080]   block, you could lower that. But you could, you know, if you want to just
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.520]   start drinking deuterium depleted water from an energetic
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.880]   standpoint, then putting water in this block is advantageous.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.960]   Okay, so that's kind of the idea. But again, it's all done on an energetic
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.840]   level. It's not done on a molecular or not done
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.160]   in a 3D kind of, you know, you know, particle-based type of
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.520]   process. It's all done from an energetic standpoint
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.000]   and can be measured bioenergetically. Okay, so that's the three special features
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.800]   of the, you know, of the five blocks. So when you're trying to decide
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.320]   which one do I want, then here are, you know, here are some things that you should
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.800]   consider. And one is right off the bat is the energy level. Now, a lot of people
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.800]   gravitate towards, "I want to get the most powerful one." You know, and that's
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.480]   great, you know, but here I want to caution people with, is if you're new to
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.080]   this, that might not be, you know, you're jumping into the deep end of the
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.160]   quantum pool, and it may be a little overwhelming. Even with the harmony
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.640]   feature, it could be overwhelming. I bought, I went and by when I won one
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.320]   in a contest, and I got it, and it was overwhelming me, and I've been around
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.400]   blocks for four years. So, you know, it is really, really strong in terms of
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.760]   just energy. And so, you know, so, but, you know, but if that's your thing,
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.240]   right? So, you know, but from low to high, the quantum is the lowest on the energy
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.400]   scale, then travel, grand, and infinity, and then super block. So, you know, a lot
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.560]   of people kind of gravitate towards, they want the biggest, biggest TV,
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.720]   they want the strongest block, but I just want to caveat again, and this is
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.880]   something that goes back to the beginning of when we started this, which was
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:17.520]   the idea that frequency trumps energy. And I want to really kind of, what do I
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.240]   mean by that, is that when it comes to us being energy, beings,
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.560]   and being, you know, just basically beings of consciousness,
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:33.360]   its frequency trumps energy. So, you can have frequency with the lowest energy
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.920]   block, and you can have frequency with the highest energy block, and it's still
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.880]   just the frequency and the frequencies and all these different things and
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:46.240]   frequencies can do our magic, essentially. And so, as, you know, when you've got,
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.880]   when you're working with frequencies, it doesn't matter how strong the block is,
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.720]   okay? And that's kind of what I want to point out. So, strength, you know, more
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.480]   strength is not necessarily, you know, more is not necessarily better,
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.680]   is what I'm trying to convey. Now, the other consideration that, you know, hey,
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.440]   if this is your thing, if you've got a special nook involved in your
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.720]   house, if you want to put a, you know, basically, it's an art piece,
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.680]   I mean, when you look at these things, they're beautiful. And so, if you want to
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.480]   place this, you have a little spot in your, in your house,
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.240]   or a kitchen counter, or in your truck or car, and you just want to, you know,
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.520]   hey, this is kind of war, you know, then you might want to be considering size.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.440]   And so, size is actually a really important thing, because the idea here is that the
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.760]   travel block was literally designed to be travel, like, you know, to carry around
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.840]   with you, it's so tiny, it's only five inches tall and four inches square, right?
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.760]   And then the quantum block is eight inches square, infinity block is eight inches
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.480]   square, but nine inches high, the super block is 15 inches square, right?
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.000]   And then the, I'm sorry, 14 inches and the grand is 15.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.480]   And so, these things, the latter two here are huge, and they're really designed to
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.960]   put big things into. And so, like, you know, for example, when I take a look at,
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:00.880]   like, you know, if I wanted to buy a block and I had a specific purpose for it,
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.280]   then having, you know, knowing what size it is, is kind of as equally important as
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.440]   what strength it is. But again, you know, like, I'm on the, I'm on the side of where,
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.280]   you know, strength more is better, in my opinion. But, you know, that doesn't mean
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.640]   you guys can't go for more strength, but size is really important as well,
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.760]   because, you know, you might not have enough kitchen counterspace or whatever.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.080]   So think about size, but that's the idea here, is that you've got small to large on
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.600]   your choices of different blocks. They all do the same thing. Three of them do some
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.160]   special stuff. And size is important, as well as, you know, strength, but there you go.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.520]   But lastly, I do want to kind of, this is, so I want to give you my recommendation.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:40.560]   And so this is for more things to think about. So think about how strong you want it. And if you're,
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.640]   if you're new to this, you may not want to jump into the deep end of the quantum pool and kind of
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:50.400]   start out low, like maybe with a travel block. If you're, you know, but if you want to just go for
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.320]   it, then, you know, you can go for it. If you want to really go for it, if you want to go for it,
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.000]   that's going to be the super block. If you want to really, really go for it, that would be the
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.560]   infinity block, because that thing can get upgraded to infinity, right? And that sort of thing.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.560]   And then when you think about size, well, travel was designed to carry around with you,
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.040]   specifically designed for easy traveling, put it in your car, right? And then, you know, again,
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:17.200]   the other thing about size is that the ground block is perfect for kitchens and restaurants,
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.040]   because you can charge big stuff. You can put a whole plate in there, because if you, if anyone,
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.560]   you know, who has an infinity block or a quantum block, they're only eight inches,
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.440]   most plates are nine or 10 inches, right? So you can't just stick a plate in there easily,
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:35.280]   you know, and so, or your groceries, you know, but, you know, a ground block or a super block is
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.600]   perfect for that, you know, because like what I do is, as I get groceries, I just stick them all
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.560]   in the ground block before I put them away. It's so easy to charge my food. And so that, you know,
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:51.280]   so that's one concept is, you know, that applies to size. But my recommendation here is, if you
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:57.760]   are looking for a block, specifically because you're really into imprinting, you are a healer or a
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.800]   tinker, and you want to kind of mix around with different frequencies that you can create and
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:09.120]   customize and so forth. And quantum block is the block. If you want to dabble in copying
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.080]   frequencies and having a frequency library, and you have, let's say a smaller space, like let's say
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:19.200]   you just, you know, you rent a room at home, you know, you know, like a home share, or you have a
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.840]   small condo, whatever, you know, or even living in a van, you know, the van life people will
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.760]   quantum blocks perfect for that. And so is the travel block, because it's small, it's great for
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:34.080]   small spaces, and it's perfect for that. So quantum is got the, it was got the plus of being small,
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:39.040]   not as small as the travel block, but it's good for small spaces. The travel block is definitely
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.000]   perfect for small things, you know, for little tiny areas. And then you can kind of carry it to
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.200]   the restaurant and charge, charge things with, with your travel block, right there at the table.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.800]   But the thing again, about the grand block that I kind of wanted to point out again,
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:58.080]   is it's great for kitchens. I use mine in my kitchen all the time. Now my infinity block now,
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.160]   again, you know, that's for the people that are, that's for you tinker's out there, and you want
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.960]   to see how far this can go, and what you can do with it, the infinity block is for you. You
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.040]   definitely want to go just keep in mind that it's only nine inches tall and eight inches square,
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:16.160]   if you know for charging stuff, but it's great for quantum healing. And again, it's great for,
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.720]   let's, you know, raising your vibration, you know, to lift up your consciousness. You know,
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:25.840]   then the infinity block by far is going to be the one. And then lastly, this brand new block,
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:32.560]   this super block is its character is healing. And so it's, it's really special in that regard,
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:39.120]   you know, and so the idea thing is that it's got the best of both worlds. It's great for healing,
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:44.720]   and it's great for charging big stuff. And so, you know, so it's really if that's going to be
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:50.400]   your deciding decision point, then that is definitely a great option is getting this super block as
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.520]   it can do both. But you got to remember one thing though, that the strength of the super block is
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:02.080]   fixed. All right, the infinity block can be upgraded beyond the strength of the super. So it all
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:07.200]   depends on, you know, your dedication to upgrading and that sort of thing. But so that's why infinity
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.920]   block kind of trumps the super one when it comes to strength. But right now, if you just wanted to
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.400]   buy a strong block, that's big, and that's great with healing, then that would be the super one.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.360]   So I hope this was helpful to give you some things to think about in terms of like, you know,
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.920]   we got when you want to buy a block, the first thing you should think of is what do I want to
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:31.520]   do with it? What I want to get out of it, right? So you know that you can get these very, you know,
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:36.160]   the core features, you know, that's why you're here. That's why you're watching this video is like,
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.560]   yeah, I want EMF. I want to be able to, you know, harmonize my environment. I want to,
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.720]   I want that energy. I want to boost my energy level. And then the other considerations,
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.960]   obviously, are going to be, well, how strong do you want this thing to be? And then how big is it
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.640]   going to be? And then, you know, what could you do with it? And those are the things to think
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.440]   about. And if you got any questions at all, come on down to our telegram chat group and ask away.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.280]   There's tons of other people that have owned these things for years, just like me. And you know,
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.600]   be more than happy to answer your questions. But that's the things to think about. And I
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.240]   wish you well. Thank you for watching the video of Elandak to our German friends. I hope this was
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.400]   helpful and got you thinking. And other than that, hey, have a great day. Oh, and you know, if you
