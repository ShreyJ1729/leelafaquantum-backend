[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me Kay Elmer and in
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.760]   this video I would like to share with you an experiment that I ran on myself
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.880]   involving the metaoxy test and just to let you know I really wasn't planning on
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.400]   actually making this video but after thinking about it for quite some time I
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.680]   realized that even if you have an experiment that fails that's still
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.000]   information worth sharing because in science there's no good or bad and
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.440]   they're just results so welcome to my first fail video so here we go
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.280]   disclaimers first this material is for research purposes only C60 oil is not
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.000]   approved for consumption by the FDA your you understand the making and
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.080]   consuming C60 oil is experimental and you do so at your own risk I do not
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.480]   endorse any products I do not get paid in any way for making videos this
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.680]   material is purely my own research today willingly share with others all right
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.840]   let's jump in what is the metaoxy test so what that what it is it's a test that
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.480]   measures lipid peroxidation in the body this it's produced this test you can
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.760]   buy a home test it's produced by a place called New Vision Health Center and it's
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.040]   run by a guy named Dr. Zyrowski and there are all the links are in the video
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.160]   description as always so you can go ahead and take a look at his video and he
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.080]   explains it in depth I'm gonna give you the two second version which is basically
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.160]   lipid peroxidation what does that mean well radical oxygen comes into your body
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.920]   and IE toxins and they steal electrons from your cells and it damages your
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.240]   cells and it and basically as those cells somewhat deteriorate okay they
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.840]   release a chemical called Mulan Mulan deal the hell to hide that's my best
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.200]   pronunciation and when that Mulan deal to hide is released into your body okay it
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.200]   does get excreted out your urine and there's an actual test this guy's put
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.440]   together that is this little test here where it allows you to test for this
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.240]   this chemical Mulan deal to hide and see if actually measure the level of
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.040]   oxidation that your body's being exposed to all right so in a nutshell it
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.320]   measures the amount of inflamation of your body and as you know I'm really into
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.720]   C60 and what is C60 well it reduces inflammation because it's an electron
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.360]   donor and it runs around and mops up all the toxins and helps your body repair
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.800]   itself and so I thought when I saw this that this was the perfect test to use in
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.960]   conjunction with taking C60 to measure the effectiveness of C60 that was the
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.200]   objective and the purpose of my experiment it's a six week experiment that I just
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.600]   finished a couple of days ago and I so I'm I just wrapped it all up and and here
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.040]   you go so what happened was was I found out about this test I watched this
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.920]   video went to the website and I ordered three of the tests and so the costs are
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.880]   $19.99 per test $99.95 for shipping so I put out about 70 bucks to buy three of
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.600]   these things you get this little this was my first concern was you get the
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.560]   packet in a little bit a sandwich baggie and it consists of this little cup for
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.960]   you to capture your urine and a little vial and you get this little pipette and
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.280]   you only put one milliliter of urine into the vial and shake it up for 60
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.200]   seconds and then from that moment on you've got approximately three minutes to
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.200]   then compare it to the color chart and based on the coloration of the urine
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.240]   mixed in with the chemical inside this vial it'll tell you whether or not by
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.580]   coloration the darker means you you are heavily oxidized and the lighter the
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.880]   color down to this light pink color then it implies that you are doing quite
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.680]   well living in antioxidant diet and that your body is is not as inflamed so
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.600]   that's the theory okay and so what I did was I set up a test where it was the
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.120]   month of January so for two weeks prior to the beginning of January I stopped
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.200]   taking all my supplements and I take a lot and so I'd stopped taking
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.400]   everything including C60 and I just just had my normal diet and so I wanted
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.400]   to make sure that there was no antioxidants in my body as best as
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.040]   possible and the reason I picked two weeks was because as we all know very
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.120]   based on who you talk to but C60 you know flushes out of your body within
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.840]   97 hours all the way to 10 days depending on you know what study you
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.920]   read so hey if it's 10 days at the top end of the scale I went two weeks so I
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.160]   figured hey I'm gonna start clean two weeks nothing and then I started taking
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.360]   C60 so what happened was was I planned to just do this for a month and then
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.800]   test and then what happened though this is always real life here I started and
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.680]   I wanted to measure midway right and so what I did was I took I got a bottle of
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:20.520]   Gresca's carbon 60 and I started taking the C60 supplement every single day and
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.520]   then when I got to the middle of the month I retested my inflammation and then
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.360]   at that point I had some issues because in the second week of this I started
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.400]   experiencing kidney pain okay so I had so I decided to not finish the rest of
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.440]   the month using Gresca's and I have been decided to finish the month using
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.840]   Revive so Revive is a product that the maker of that's I and Mitchell and he's
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.480]   got a product line called Health C360 on the Carbon Plus website and so I
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:01.000]   started taking Revive and I finished the month of my C60 trial with with a
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.360]   different product so I tried two different C60 products so at the end of
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.360]   the day I'm taking C60 every day okay I just had to switch products and I'll go
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.880]   on a sidebar discussion about this kidney thing later but that was the
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.080]   whole idea is that for one month I clean up for two weeks don't take
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.480]   anything and then for one month I'm taking C60 and I'm measuring the mid
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.960]   point measuring the end right sounds like a logical approach so then this is the
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.960]   dosage that I took I took Gresca's Carbon 60 product is the recommended
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.760]   serving size he goes by serving size his 0.67 milliliters or two-thirds of a
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.440]   dropper two-thirds of a milliliter okay and so one dropper is two-thirds of a
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.680]   milliliter and I decided you know I'm a big guy so I decided well I'll just take
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.400]   two droppers you know just because it just seems like such a little amount as
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.720]   you know one old dropper so I took two whole droppers every single day for two
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.520]   weeks and then I switched over to this guy right here which is the Revive
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.840]   product and the recommended dosage on this guy and this guy actually has a
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.600]   dosage chart you know so it's kind of cool if you've never really took a look
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.240]   at it like an actual C60 dosage chart there's one for women there's one for
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.320]   men goes by your weight you know it's not one size fits all which is sort of like
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.200]   every other product out there but this product is designed towards your weight
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.880]   so for my weight the recommended was 15 milliliters or or what it comes down
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.840]   to is one tablespoon so I took one tablespoon a day of the Revive product
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:40.360]   so the the results were this on day one this is before I started I took a
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:47.400]   before snapshot of the inflammation using the meta-oxy test on day 15 I did
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.680]   it again and it was like absolutely no change and on day 31 I did it again and
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.680]   it you know eyeballing it it doesn't look I'm not even going to state that I
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.440]   think it looks lighter it looks exactly the same so this was the thing and it
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.920]   was a little frustrating because I you know put out 70 plex to see and I thought
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.680]   I would make this really cool video you know showing how you can test but you
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.560]   know so the results were inconclusive the results were nothing happened nothing
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:22.640]   changed it was the same all three times so quite frustrating and so I contacted
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.360]   actually half halfway through when I got to this point and I started taking you
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.360]   know the Revive to get to that point I actually sent out an email it took about
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.920]   about a week to get back to me and so my question I sent them I sent the email
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.000]   to the new vision guys I'm like hey I use the meta-oxy test for two weeks while
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.880]   taking a strong antioxidant I didn't say I was taking C60 but taking C60 is a
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.640]   super antioxidant right and the color of the test was red and is two weeks
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:55.080]   enough time before and after and why red the chart shows shades of purple and so
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.520]   their response to me was and and this is really important and and I want to
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.000]   point out that this response this information is not on the website it's
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.200]   not in the materials that comes with the test so it was kind of a little bit of a
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.080]   learning experience here was that they said you want to give it a solid month
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.080]   which is fine I gave it a month right which is an extra test in between of
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:25.800]   effort that includes dietary changes with an anti-inflammatory diet along with
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:31.760]   supplements before retesting to any changes were made and I was like oh
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.960]   really that's not you know that wasn't in the product literature gee I would
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.960]   like to have known that ahead of time because that's not a that's not what I
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.840]   did and and then secondly and then they then they go on about the color and
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.680]   secondly the example of colors on the instruction card is more of a reddish
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.240]   purple also the instruction card is on paper blah blah blah so so the whole
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.120]   idea is that you know the colors weird because it's you know they you know just
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.600]   the coloration and and you could be taking B vitamins that change the color
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.000]   of your urine which affects the color of the of the end test and there so if you
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.800]   read the product literature by the way that the the handout that comes with the
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.600]   with the with the test there I have a link to that in the video description as
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:21.920]   well so bottom line the conclusion and results of my six-week trial $70 I
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:27.660]   didn't take my vitamins for six weeks and I'm dragging but you know from not
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:32.120]   taking vitamins but I I'm doing really well actually because on the other side
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.040]   of the fence because I'm taking C 60 it's actually keep me going but you know
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:44.200]   hey this is a conclusion dope I feeling pretty stupid I wish I would have known
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.160]   that information but there was no way for me to know that unless I would have
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.840]   called them and talked to them and told them what I was doing but what the
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:11:01.160]   conclusion of this experiment is is that the metahoxy test is is not
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:08.000]   sufficient at the test it will not measure the effect of C 60 because if
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   you have to actually you know you have to change your whole diet you got to take
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.680]   supplements which C 60 is for anything to register on this test so I suppose
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:23.080]   the best way to say it is that the test is is too light to even to pick up that
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:30.040]   level of of of micro you know what a microbiology or you know the level of
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.800]   changes that C 60 is doing because quite frankly you know I wasn't taking
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.880]   supplements I take supplements all the time and and but I was still living my
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.620]   normal lifestyle get up at five go to work I worked ten hours sometimes 12
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.120]   hours a day and then I get home and I got to walk my dogs and and when I don't
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:52.600]   take my supplements and I don't have C 60 honestly I don't I'm burned out when I
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.800]   get home and it's really hard to walk my dogs but taking the C 60 even without
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.920]   my supplements I'm still power walking a mile every day with my dogs after work
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.160]   and so I I have I could keep that energy going you know I don't drink coffee or
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:12.480]   anything so you know luckily I was taking the C 60 but yeah it just didn't
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.960]   work at all and it won't work so hopefully this saves you money if you were
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:21.400]   thinking about doing it yourself now just to go back to the kidney thing you
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.320]   know one thing about I've been really thinking about this kidney thing because
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.520]   it affects me and I haven't heard it about it affecting anyone else so I
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.280]   really thought about it and and what really I believe is happening with me in
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:39.680]   particular is that I first had my first kidney stone was on my right side or
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.760]   sorry my left side and and then one year later I had a kidney stone on my right
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.600]   and then a year later I had a kidney stone on my left and then last year would
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.040]   have been the fourth year and you would expect that you know I'm ping ponging
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:58.640]   back and forth and I'm passing stones but I never passed a stone on the right
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.640]   side I just started drinking this chonka piedra tea which is called bone
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.680]   crusher tea and it kind of kept it what do I think happened was that I've got
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.760]   really microscopic stones in there that aren't enough to kind of push me over
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:17.280]   the edge but at the same time they're there because every time I ingest a C60
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:23.200]   that's because Grasca C60 is not it's not just lipo fullerenes and lipo
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.160]   fullerenes are the C60 that dissolves and then it informs into a liposome and
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.320]   so you know from stirring it up and stuff and then filtering so Grasca's is
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:39.560]   not just lipo fullerenes he only mixes it for a few minutes and most of it is
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:44.920]   collodial suspension meaning that the C60 particulates are floating in the oil
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.400]   and they're not filtered out they're just floating there and so I think what
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.080]   happens to me and and this happened to me last year where I wasn't filtering my
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:59.000]   own homemade C60 oil was that even though it's microscopic it's enough to
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.720]   trigger or get clogged up in my kidneys and I start experiencing kidney stone
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.600]   pain so I was into it about a week and I started feeling the pain again and I
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:13.280]   was like oh no and by the second week I was hurting and so that's why I stopped
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.400]   and so for you guys who have kidney stones you know beware of drinking or
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.960]   ingesting any C60 product that is not filtered that's that's the bottom line
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:28.400]   so now you know but once I switched to this this is filtered I was fine it's
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.600]   been two weeks I still have a little bit of pain I'm drinking my my tea every day
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:38.840]   but mostly the pain's gone away now so that's my kidney story anyway hey thank
