[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   Hello everyone and another Tinkers Academy video, I'm your host Kay Elmer and this is
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:12.200]   a response video from a series of questions asked of me in the Telegram chat group of
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.080]   which I felt it was a lot easier to just make a quick video to answer the questions as opposed
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.000]   to trying to type it out with my thumbs for the next half an hour and you know it's a
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.600]   good question so it's a good set of questions that I thought everyone would benefit from
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.000]   the video response because I do get this question asked every now and then so here's the first
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.920]   question and this is from Skye and she here I'm sorry asks can you please elaborate on
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.000]   the difference between these two concepts what's the difference between storing frequency versus
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.320]   replicating a Leila card and that answer is it all depends on the density of the material
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:04.520]   and so what I mean by that is that any metal object right will hold a frequency and so will
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:11.040]   stones and crystals and and then soft materials like clothing and shoes will hold it but it
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.040]   fades away for it to stick around I mean for the energy or the frequency to stay permanently
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.040]   then it needs to be a denser material such as metal okay will hold a frequency and the
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.720]   idea that it just you can store a frequency on something as you know as as light and flimsy
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.360]   as foil all the way up to you know using a Leila card and or capsules titanium spheres
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.840]   and so forth you can put frequencies on any of them okay so having a frequency copied
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.520]   to an object is you know is not not an issue at all it will hold it and hold it indefinitely
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.600]   now the difference between just putting frequency on a piece of foil or putting it on a card
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.200]   okay is the idea of the density of the material and what I mean by that is quantum energy
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.960]   has this capacity to embed into objects and the denser the metal the more energy it can
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.560]   absorb and then of course then broadcasting and create a field of quantum energy around
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.520]   it and so the idea though is you want to replicate a Leila card you need to get something that
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.360]   got some got some weight to it and so that basically is is basically what Leila uses
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.480]   it and is an anodized aluminum card it's a business card you know sized whatever the
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.840]   dimension I had three and a half inches by two and a half inches I think you know look
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.280]   it up but but the key is the thickness right here and the thickness on a Leila card is
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.360]   0.05 inches or 1.27 millimeters and that's going to give you what the standard is that
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.360]   is been measured and which produces a eight centimeter diameter energy field around it
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.080]   so if you put quantum energy into this this weighted item right here I'll just you know
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.400]   the card a typical Leila card it's going to produce that eight centimeter field of energy
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.640]   around it and that energy is what broadcasts the frequency out so just having frequency
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.840]   sitting on a piece of foil really doesn't do anything you need energy to actually then
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.120]   you know basically broadcast that energy out into its field of which when you put it against
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.840]   your body it's now you know part of your bio field and that's how you you know experience
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.000]   the frequency through that energy pushing you know basically radiating into in a very
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.920]   positive way now the other idea here is that you know the more dense you get and different
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.080]   types of metals okay aluminum is a is a great storage of quantum energy steel copper brass
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.920]   any of these metals but what was been discovered is that titanium seems to because of its density
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.520]   if you look on the periodic table gold as well the the heavier that like tungsten things
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.280]   like that the it seems to be that the more dense the material is the metal the more energy
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.800]   it can hold and that's just what they've discovered and so that's why they use titanium spheres
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.360]   or medical grade titanium spheres inside the capsule so you know this is a lot heavier
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:21.960]   than a card and because it's a lot heavier and its titanium then the field of a capsule
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:27.920]   is roughly six feet as opposed to four inches right so something like this four inches but
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.480]   it works just great you put it against your body which is inside your bio field and you'll
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.920]   get the benefits of that energy and that frequency or you can wear a capsule which
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.040]   is your entire you know your entire body and anything close to you actually because the
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.240]   field will be six feet because it's so much more weight and it's using titanium so that's
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.640]   the difference between frequency and energy and if you wanted to replicate you know Leila
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.320]   Card you need to use the same size of a Leila Card in terms of density now the second question
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:07.320]   here is I assume once a frequency is stored on a foil or a thinner card it can then be
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.280]   copied to another metal object same at you know and that yeah that absolutely that's
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.200]   the whole idea behind if you watch the super capsule tutorial where I'm using a piece of
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.120]   foil I put frequency on the foil put it in the super capsule and you know then the super
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.200]   capsule then broadcasts that frequency out so yes you could absolutely take any Leila
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.600]   Card you can take any Leila Card this is my collection of Leila Cards and you can put
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.200]   that with any other metal object put it in the quantum block or any other block and then
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.560]   it'll copy that frequency on to that metal object again you know you're going to want
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.960]   to have it depending on your use case if you want to replicate the card use a 0.05 inch
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.440]   thick card or if you just want to store the frequencies and create like a frequency collection
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.480]   like I have then you could use you could use foil if you want the reason I don't use foil
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:07.840]   to store my frequencies because it's just too flimsy and you know and it tears and it
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.320]   just you know it doesn't hold up very well so what I do for just storing frequencies
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.120]   cheaply is I buy these thinner little aluminum cards okay and they don't bend and they fit
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.920]   into a business card envelope so I can keep it nice and organized so you could weigh lighter
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.600]   right but you know just it's just as good for storing the frequency okay doesn't really
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:35.920]   have much energy okay now the other issue here was the post goes on to say the thickest
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:42.600]   card I was able to find on Amazon is 0.4 and I believe you meant 0.04 inches just shy
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.000]   of the 0.05 recommendation does that mean it will not be able to replicate the Leila
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.320]   Card that is correct if you get anything smaller than that then it's going to be a smaller
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:59.480]   field all the way down to no field okay so you know yes it'll be a smaller field unfortunately
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.600]   you know Leila hasn't gone through the pro I mean trying to go through the process of analyzing
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:11.080]   field you know size it's slash strength for every possible metal object out there they
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.280]   just they just don't have the bandwidth for that right so what we do know as a standard
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.660]   is that you know cards are you know eight centimeters or four inches capsules are six
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.960]   feet etc so you know I go with what we what is known and so yeah you would definitely
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:34.280]   want to have a standard card if you get a slightly thinner card it'll be a smaller
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   field less energy but no idea exact to that's to exact size so to replicate you know you
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.600]   want to stick to the standards there the next question is is meaning can I make a copy of
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.760]   a Leila cue card onto a thinner card yes and make second gen foil later on this other
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:00.280]   point four card make a second gen oh yeah yeah you can yeah once you copy a frequency
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.920]   onto anything onto any metal that metal then holds that frequency and it can be used as
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:14.200]   the source of that frequency so common practice that I do is what I'm using frequencies in
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:19.640]   a block you know like I'm doing some quantum entanglement quantum broadcasting I will just
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:25.260]   burn the frequency of the card onto a piece of foil keep a whole this is my thing here
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.680]   for my quantum station and I just keep foil I just burn a little piece of foil usually
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.520]   like you know like a two or three inch square piece of foil I'll put the frequency on the
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.640]   foil and then I'll put the foil in with the picture of whatever item I'm sending the frequency
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.320]   to and then the frequency goes with it because then this is what's broadcasting the you know
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.720]   this is the quantum field of a block is then what's going to broadcast that energy into
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:56.880]   the field or you know as opposed to titanium sphere so yes the the second item the copied
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:04.480]   two item becomes a copy that you can then use to send you know to use as a frequency source
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:11.640]   the next question is is it better to copy the lay the cue cards onto a wad of foil versus
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:19.280]   a thin card the answer to that is to me yes as for the reason I stated that these hold
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:25.680]   up a lot better for storage frequencies I use foils like I said when I when I put them
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:31.080]   in my blocks to send frequencies and of course if they sit in a block especially if I'm using
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.200]   an eye in an infinity block or a grand block or a travel block that that little piece of
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.520]   foil is going to get really supercharged I don't want it to be next to any of my other
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.040]   you know foils and things like that so I use foil just as a one time use when I'm doing
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:52.920]   quantum entanglement work and then I just throw the foil away but I but for copies of frequencies
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:58.200]   I put them on to cards these little flimsy cards to store and of course you know the
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:04.160]   layla cards themselves as sources of frequencies last thing yeah just as an FY I don't actually
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.400]   use the cards as a device to me I just use cards are all just to store a frequency and
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.880]   when I want to use one of these layla frequencies I'll put it onto a piece of foil and stick
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:20.720]   it in a stick it in a capsule and wear that around for a while or I will put it in the
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.800]   block and put my picture in or whatever animal dog plant you know name it and you out broadcast
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.840]   the frequency that way or you know quantum upgrade right now the next thing the next
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:35.200]   question was was lastly can you share how you organize and store all these different
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:42.080]   frequency carrying cards slash foils and I guess the other comment was won't be able
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:47.120]   to find enough pouches to put each different type of foil in if I store them all in okay
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.960]   so let me just do one question at a time can you share okay yes absolutely more than happy
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:59.080]   to now because these are all business cards okay what I do is I basically will copy frequencies
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:05.560]   and like right here I'm always building on to my collection so molecular frequencies about
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.760]   to start doing resident frequencies and start building up my my existing frequency collection
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.240]   this is it right here I'll keep it off of the ties and I put all the cards now the reason
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:21.400]   this is so helpful again you know it's a cart you can buy these envelopes right here they
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.960]   come in packs and they're really cheap and there's a business card envelope and then
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.920]   I just store them all alphabetically so you can just like any one of these guys you can
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.520]   see like here's the and here's the ology booster and here's the card inside of it right and
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.600]   so this is how I store my storm and business envelopes business card envelopes and I use
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.000]   a label maker just to keep it really organized and then whenever I need to use it I just
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   pull it out of the envelope put it in the cube lock with the target object and then
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.840]   make copy it to it and then put them away so this is how I store everything as business
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:59.000]   cards in envelopes everything's labeled so and I also keep a inventory list in an Excel
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.200]   spreadsheet so I know exactly what I have so don't waste time making redundant which
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:10.400]   I always do and then lastly if I put them all in one box will the freak will I get frequency
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:15.000]   soup now that is the most important question you just asked me and I want to point out
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.640]   something really important for those you guys who are building up frequency libraries is
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.680]   that there is a distinct difference between what I just showed you and the Layla carts
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.200]   now you'll notice that I keep my Layla carts and pouches and there's a reason for that
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.400]   so this frequency collection is made with the quantum block you have to be very consistent
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.840]   you don't want to make your collection with different blocks and the reason is is that
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.040]   you don't want to have that frequency soup you don't want them to copy over onto each
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:45.360]   other so every frequency in this library was made with a quantum block which means they
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.840]   all have the same level of energy and when they all have the same level of energy they're
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.120]   kind of equal to each other so they don't copy their frequencies onto each other alright
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.000]   so you're safe each one of these will never copy over onto each other because they're
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.600]   all the same strength these guys the Layla quantum cards are made with an IV4 okay which
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   is much stronger than a QB and so because they're stronger but they're all the same
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:15.400]   as well right so you can store all your Layla carts together no problem but you never want
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:21.440]   to store your Layla cards with your what I call my QB cards because then the Layla frequencies
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.160]   the cards are stronger they're also thicker and they're going to then copy their frequency
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:31.800]   onto my collection which I don't want to do this is my second collection I had to throw
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:36.960]   the first one away because I didn't realize that at the time this is way early like three
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.320]   years ago and we all started doing this and we didn't quite know and understand this
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:48.080]   concept of you know they are copying over things so yeah it's important otherwise if
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.760]   you put like a Layla card in here right that frequency of the Layla card will copy to whatever
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.720]   is closest to it and you're going to get some bleed over and so you don't want that you
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.040]   want to keep all your stuff clean so that you know like you know like if I'm making
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.400]   a booster and I want to pull this out like here's my calm for dogs I made this to calm
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:12.400]   little skittish dogs and yeah I wouldn't want to let's say you know like happiness burnt
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.600]   onto this you know guys just want it because you want to keep them calm right so that's
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:22.120]   kind of the importance of storing your cards I do keep these in pouches because they are
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.200]   stronger than these guys and I don't ever want to make that mistake and so I store these
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:32.360]   guys here in my cabinet my quantum cabinet of stuff and that's how I do it so you just
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:38.200]   kind of keep them separate and make sure you don't mix the two and the pouches they fit
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.800]   quite a lot of cards before they get full then you have to start a second pouch but
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.600]   that's how you do it keep them all together and again you know you can get different cards
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:52.740]   I have a section on my blog called quantum tinker supplies or something like that I'll
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:58.760]   put the link in the in the in the chat and it's got a list of all the different places
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:04.560]   that sell cards so you can find you can find these point oh five or one point two seven
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.760]   millimeter lay less size cards others a link there's several links actually of different
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.280]   places that sell these so you know if you can't find them on Amazon other other websites
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:20.840]   do sell them I just checked these sell for anywhere from $1.30 to $1.75 each depending
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.080]   on what site you go on so you can get the aluminum ones they come in different colors
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:30.600]   this is an aluminum one same thing here it just comes in silver and then you know actually
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.680]   there's other sites there too actually went and got a titanium blank haven't quite figured
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:40.520]   out what I want to do with it but I just thought it was cool this titanium business card you
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:46.040]   know the same the right does the right size and the right thickness these were $20 each so
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.200]   you know tinkering around with titanium but I always thought you know hey I'd be I can't
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.040]   figure out what I want to do with this shit but if I do use it it will definitely become a device
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:16:01.640]   like a capsule because it's you know got some weight way heavier than the typical card you hear
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.920]   the difference right and these little flimsy guys I get them on Amazon they're they're just you know
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:12.600]   there's just something better than than foil but that's it that's what I kind of do how I store
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:18.360]   how I how I you know organize everything I hope that was helpful and answered your question and
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.760]   have a great day aloha
