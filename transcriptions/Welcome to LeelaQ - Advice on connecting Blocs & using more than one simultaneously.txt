[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.880]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and this video is another installment in the FAQ video series.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.120]   Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.680]   This is where we pluck random questions or frequently asked questions out of the telegram
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.000]   chat groups, and then either I'll answer the question or I'll ask Philip on Holzendorf,
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.160]   the owner operator of Layla Quantum Tech, to get his take on, on, you know, what the question is.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.720]   So this video is, the question is, what is the advice on connecting blocks together?
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.760]   If you have more than one and you want to connect them or use them, use more than one
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.360]   simultaneously, you know, what is his advice and directions on how to use more than one block at
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.640]   a time and connecting them? So let's listen to what his take is on that question. Here we go.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.640]   Now the fourth one that kind of just came up with is a couple of different people are tinkering
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.320]   around with, they have more than one block. And so what they're wondering, and I was trying to
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.640]   figure out what the answer was, was, you know, what's your advice on connecting blocks? And so,
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.000]   and then using more than one simultaneously. So what it limits to the start with the first,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.240]   the second question first, okay? So what they meant by using more than one simultaneously was
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.360]   separating the plates. So think of it like a big cross, right? And what they wanted to do is they
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.480]   have two travel blocks and they wanted to put one horizontal and one vertical and sit exactly in the
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.280]   middle between all four plates. And they were wondering what would that, you know, they were
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.680]   wondering does, would that increase the amount of energy they're experiencing? Would it interfere,
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.960]   you know, would the two separate, you know, the four plates, would they interfere with each other,
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.120]   you know, that kind of thing? And then so that was one person wanted to do that. Another person
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.160]   was going to do something similar with their infinity blocks where they were going to kind of,
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.000]   I think set, not disassemble them, right? But set them where there was going to be three of them,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.360]   and they would sit in the middle of the three, like concentric circles, kind of like this symbol
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.360]   right here, you know, for the International Association, you see how you've got three separate energy,
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.440]   you know, waves, right? And then right here in the middle is where they all kind of, you know,
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.920]   bounce off each other and connect. So someone was thinking, Hey, if I took three blocks and I did
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.920]   that, would that increase the energy? Or would that interfere with the fields? You know, so that's
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.480]   what they're wondering. And it's a really great question. I'm like, wow, if you got more than one
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.680]   block, you know, you can really play around. So okay, so what do you think? I would not do it. I would
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.760]   not advise anyone does that. It's for a reason we tell people to keep the blocks apart, you know,
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.880]   six feet at minimum. And that's the same thing here, because you would have two blocks interfering.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.920]   And I just wouldn't do it. I mean, that doesn't mean that you couldn't try and figure stuff out,
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.520]   right? But to me, I rather see a destabilizing field or at least a field that's not as clear,
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.720]   not as supportive as if it's just if it's just one, one block you're using. So rather, you know,
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.480]   put the plates off one apart and lay in that, like you did it, for example, in your sleep
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:22.800]   experiment. And I would not use two at the same time. Now having those in the room and having them
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.720]   then they're anyway connected and all that that's all no problem. That's all fantastic. But I don't
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.760]   think physically you would want to just put them together. Okay. Okay. All right. So let me give you
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.120]   my personal example is I have a six foot couch and tables on both sides, right? And I have my
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.000]   boosted infinity block on each end table. So I sit between two infinity blocks, you know,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.720]   there's they're assembled, right? And I'm using each one of them for quantum entanglement right
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.040]   now. So one person's in one and a dog's in another. But I'm sitting between two infinity blocks on
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.160]   my couch. No problem, right? Because there's six feet apart. Yeah, it's perfect. Yeah. All right.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.720]   Yeah. That's great. It's just basically, yeah, it certainly amplifies the the field that you're
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.640]   sitting in. So it's a relatively strong field, but it's it's perfect, you know. Okay. All right. And
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.800]   then the other piece of this question was the connecting the blocks. So now we had already
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.320]   talked up for anybody that wants to know we Philip and I had already discussed connecting the blocks
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.280]   based on the issue that or the situation that happened with the recent hurricane in Florida.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.760]   So he's, you know, you've already described that if anybody wants to know about that,
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.360]   I think it's in one of the FAQ videos. But this other concept of connecting the blocks was
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.400]   in a recent interview, one of the last two interviews you had, Philip, I wanted to clarify
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.440]   something where you said that the blocks will sync up with each other and that they actually
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.760]   increase in strength by themselves. So I was just real curious if you could expand on
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.640]   on blocks naturally syncing up with each other and do they really do that? And then what does that
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.360]   mean? And then, and then you were saying that over time these these blocks actually
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.920]   increase in strength by themselves is, you know, is what you guys are noticing. So
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.800]   if you don't mind, I thought it was a I, you know, it's kind of funny where the person interviewing
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.520]   you didn't realize what you had just said and how incredible. I don't think they totally went
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.280]   over them. They didn't even ask a follow up question. And I'm listening to the interview,
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:42.160]   I'm like, Oh, what did he just say? So, you know, yeah, yeah. So I wanted to ask like, hey,
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.520]   what does that mean? Because that is amazing. Yeah.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:55.600]   Yeah. So the second part first, indeed the blocks increase their power, their consciousness level
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:03.440]   over time by them being used. And we don't write that on the website. We don't talk much about it
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:11.040]   because it's such a, I think it's a very difficult concept to understand for most people how that
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.520]   would work, right? Naturally, you would think something just decreases in power and until it
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.560]   doesn't work anymore, right? That's that's how we're used to dealing with technology.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:30.960]   But in this case, it's indeed different. So think of it as an intelligence, right? And an
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:41.200]   intelligent field. And if you give what tasks to this field, it's not that they the field becomes
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.680]   weaker. It actually becomes more knowledgeable, right? Let's just use that word for lack of a
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:55.440]   better term. And so indeed, it slightly increases in power over time. That's, that's always been
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:04.640]   the case, actually. And it is also with all blocks, the case. Now, in terms of synchronizing, so if
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:10.480]   you have different blocks in your home, they indeed connect with each other. It's that one knows
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.000]   the other, and there's, there's like, they're like brothers and sisters, right? If you think
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.680]   about it, it's not that they're completely independent, they are independent, but they're also
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:31.520]   connecting and they're also, you say, so creating this joined field in a home, right? And as soon
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.720]   let's say someone has already a couple of blocks, but now they get the super block in the beginning
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:43.680]   of January, and then they put the super block at home. This super block will instantly become the
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:53.120]   boss and this leader more, more less in the home, in regards to the blocks. And all the other blocks
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.960]   will be connected to it, but it runs the show, if that makes sense. And it's still connected there,
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:12.320]   there's a synchronizing energy, and it even happens with neighbors. So if you have neighbors that live,
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:20.240]   I don't know, 500 yards away, and then they have a block, it creates this grid over the whole
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:29.200]   neighborhood, which is quite amazing and phenomenal. But you can strengthen that for specific actions.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:36.400]   Let's say what we had here with the hurricane, right? Then you would want to strengthen that field
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:42.720]   possibly and maybe put in a joined intention also, and you can definitely do that.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:49.520]   Okay, so like if I had neighbors that had blocks and we wanted to create a grid
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.440]   over our city for inclement weather protection, then we would all put in intention that says,
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:01.840]   connect my block to so-and-so's block and the kind of thing, right? And then those are the
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.720]   intentions, so all the blocks connect and protect us from the storm, right? That would be the intention.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.400]   Connect my block to other blocks and protect us from the storm. Would that be how I would
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:18.480]   I would word that? Yeah, I'm not sure if I would
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:28.400]   write down connect my block to this block or that block, rather stating it as a fact that, you know,
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:40.480]   all blocks, I don't know, Lila blocks in, I don't know, whichever city, you know, in New York City,
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:50.640]   as an example, are connected. And that almost, I mean, you can write it and yeah, why not? Just
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:59.840]   put it in as a sentence basically. Yes, and then put in what you are
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:09.280]   working on, basically, you know, all blocks work together to harmonize the
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:20.160]   neutralize the negative effects of the camtrails in the air as an example, right? Or, you know,
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.200]   whatever you want, right? I mean, obviously that's that all works. And then that intention, if it's
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:33.600]   also put into other blocks, it becomes even more powerful. Okay, so okay. And then I guess a follow
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.840]   on question just for my own sake, because I've got, yeah, I mean, I'm probably so, I got some
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.640]   got five blocks. Your house is probably full of blocks. So I'm sure that, you know, we probably
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:50.400]   can be seen from space, given how much quantum energy is coming out of our houses. But, you know,
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.320]   I mean, but I got so many different blocks. And so I've got different blocks doing different
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.120]   things at different times. So that you said that they all work independently. So I'm just kind of
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:05.280]   wondering what your take is, is like, I've got two IBs, one's got a friend of mine in it, another
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:12.000]   one's got a dog in it. In the kitchen, I'm imprinting my jug of water right now. And then I'm sleeping
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.120]   in my super block in my bedroom. So I've got at least four of them, with something going on,
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.960]   quantum blocks just sitting there waiting to be used and travel blocks in the truck. So,
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.360]   but I've got four blocks. Each one of them's got some, but something in it.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:30.240]   Is that going to interfere with what I'm trying to do individually with each one?
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.360]   Like I'm sending out heel for dogs to the dog. I'm sending out, you know,
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:42.640]   he's perfectly, you know, while they're somewhat connected energetically,
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:49.520]   they still just work on their tasks and whatever you're doing in a very independent way. So,
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:56.960]   okay. And then so my neighbors, so my neighbors are experienced, but you know,
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.320]   they're within the field. So wouldn't they be experiencing the healing frequency for that guy,
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:08.800]   my friend, and they're either experiencing the heel for dogs. And then when I'm in my super block,
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:16.800]   I am the source of frequency. And I'm assuming that I am being broadcast into the field.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.720]   And I'm just wondering, thankfully, not know. You could direct it.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:29.120]   So on a consciousness level, you could direct it that way, but that's not what you're doing. And
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:35.280]   that's not really what's happening there. Also with your dog. So if you put, I don't know, a heel
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:41.280]   for dog frequency in there with a dog, for example, it's not broadcast out. It could be
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:50.080]   by basically tasking the block to do that. But but if you're not doing that, then it just doesn't
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:57.120]   happen. Okay. So it contains that and it just keeps in its normal radius. It just has the general
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:04.240]   functions. And you know, you're not no one is impacted by the heel for dog frequency and not your
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.720]   neighbor either. Okay. All right. I was always wondering about that. Okay. Yeah, because you know,
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.040]   these things reach out so far. I mean, just right off the bat, I was wondering, the super grand
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.560]   block, because it's so much stronger. How big does that thing stretch out? I mean, do you know what
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:29.760]   the field size is? I mean, we we figured that at least in the 500 meter radios, it can neutralize,
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:40.080]   you know, the negative effects of even strong electromagnetic fields. And the the detectable
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:50.880]   radius just energetically is probably at least 1.5 kilometers. Yeah, you know, it's it's not
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:58.320]   much more than that probably. Okay, no, that's cool. Yeah, I'm just assuming
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:04.160]   this got a giant field. But okay. But thank you very much for that really, really fascinating stuff.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.280]   Love talking to you.
