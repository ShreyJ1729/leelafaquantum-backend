[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinker's Academy video. I'm your host K Almer and in this video
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.600]   I had the wonderful opportunity of speaking with Philip von Holzendorf yesterday about some of the new frequencies that are now being
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.520]   available on the Leleke website and I we also covered the five
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.220]   Frequently asked questions that that are coming up over and over again in the telegram chat now
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.880]   Philip and I we when we start talking that when so many different things come up and so many questions
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.680]   That I have you know trying to get clarification because I'm just fascinated by the subject
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.960]   So it went the the conversation went really long and and you know
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.880]   Thank you so much Philip for taking the time with me
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.360]   But you know it got too long to be one big video
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.360]   So I thought this is what I would do which I went ahead and split the video into two parts
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.800]   Part one is what you're watching right now
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.840]   It's gonna be the video part where we talk about what are the new frequencies that just got you know
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.220]   released on the website and it's a new one that's coming up in a couple of weeks and also really what's really cool about our
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.240]   conversation
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.480]   Was that you know how some of the newer frequencies that were just released last month doing you know
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.000]   What's the what's the reaction from customers and and you know it turned out to be a really great talk about you know
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.520]   Just frequencies in general that are available at Leleke cute
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.000]   And then the second part which I'll also post is going to be the five
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.660]   Frequently asked questions that I pulled from just reading the the chat
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.880]   You know I read every post and so over the last few months
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.200]   I've kind of just boiled it out to like there's five
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.080]   You know main topics that come up over and over again and we started talking about those and and that's where you know
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.520]   It did the the discussion got really in depth and and Philip provided a lot of really good clarifying information
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.640]   so that's really a very I think very valuable user guide
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.840]   You know the is the second part of the video as well. This first part is going to be the announcement explain
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.240]   How what the new frequencies are and so forth and the second part? Let's talk about that. So just real quick
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.780]   We did talk about the frequency frequently asked questions
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.880]   We talked about mixing frequencies
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.480]   You know people want to know how many is too many you know and which ones go better together
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.920]   And then we talked about cards versus capsules versus blocks because I see the question come up a lot where people are like
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.880]   Well, should I get a this one or should I get that one and and what's this one for and so that we covered that in depth?
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.520]   also the whole idea of using frequencies with blocks as well as
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.080]   Using quantum energy for overall health and wellness, you know
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.680]   That comes up all the time where people are are basically coming into the chat and like, you know, you know
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.520]   If someone's got this issue or I have this issue, you know, is this good for that?
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.160]   And you know so we really talked about that as well just to try to clarify
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.080]   You know what that's all about and then the last one where we got kind of just got goofy with me
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.700]   Was the whole idea of whole-party charging or charging body parts, you know putting yourself in the blocks
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.720]   Which is something that you know people have asked a lot about and so we covered that so that's gonna be in part two
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.760]   I really want to make sure you knew what those frequently asked questions were because it was it's just it was a great chat
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.720]   With Philip to cover those those topics. So without further ado
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.680]   Let's go ahead and jump into part one and let's talk about the new frequencies that were just available on July 30 Friday
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:27.040]   For for sale on the on the Layla Q website. All right. Thank you very much. Hello everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.040]   And I'm excited today. I'm with Philip on Holson Doref and we are going to chat about some new
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:41.160]   Frequencies at the Layla Q website as well as answer some of the most frequently asked questions on our telegram chat group
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.680]   So, you know come join us and and learn about what's new and let's see if we can hopefully maybe I answered some of the questions
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.400]   That you've had most recently with Layla Q
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.280]   So before I jump into that I'd like to go ahead and just read our disclaimer or read Philip's disclaimer
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:03.520]   Which is neither Layla keep quantum tech nor the Tinkers Academy recommend or endorse any specific test physicians procedures opinions or other information
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.480]   That may be mentioned in this video reliance on any information appearing and discuss in this video solely at everyone's own risk
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.400]   Statements made have not been evaluated by the EFSA or the FDA or any government derivatives
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:24.140]   They're up Layla Quantum Tech products and products that Layla Quantum Tech may represent are not intended to diagnose treat care or prevent any disease
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:30.720]   All right, so Philip. I wanted to actually let me introduce Phil Philip is the owner operator of Layla for those of you
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.520]   Who don't know who he is and Layla Quantum Tech is as one of the most amazing up and coming, you know
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.840]   You know companies in this in the in the quantum energy space, so
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.120]   Philip's the owner operator, but I just want to point out to everybody who may not notice this on the website
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.960]   But Philip is one of six healers. So it's not just a one guy
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.640]   Coming up with some ideas, but it's a collaboration of some extremely experienced gifted and talented healers that
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:06.840]   Work worldwide everywhere from Australia to Europe to America in terms of just you know being outright and gifted
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:14.640]   talented healers on their own right with their own, you know, you know systems and and and just businesses running and
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.700]   Helping people for years and years and years and Philip was not only able to pull these people together and create a healing network
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.960]   But what you experience with Layla Q?
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.760]   I just want to point out is is a combination of these incredible gifted people from all different walks of life
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:37.040]   We've come together to really put together to in my opinion one of the most interesting companies in the quantum energy space
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.000]   So Philip welcome good morning. How are you doing today?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.200]   Hey, okay, I'm doing fine. Thanks for having me. We're looking forward to this
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.640]   Yeah, I was excited when you told me that there's some new frequencies coming out
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.880]   And you know of course one of them is actually the one one of the ones I came up with so I'm excited about that as well
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.880]   So let's jump right into that
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.960]   And for anyone actually for anyone that wants to know more about Philip, you know, we've got tons of videos on my channel
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.880]   Where we've talked about Philip's background and about Layla Q
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.200]   And so this one is really more of a user's guide
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   And where we're just gonna basically, you know, talk about what the new stuff is and then basic answer some questions. So
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.840]   Yeah, so hey, Philip
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:25.640]   So you've got some brand new frequencies coming out that I'm pretty excited about and so I thought maybe you can just go ahead and introduce them
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.240]   I've this is the list of all of the frequencies available on the website now except for the happiness, right?
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.480]   But these highlighted ones are the new ones
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.120]   So maybe if you want to go ahead and just you know, like hey, so what are these new ones and what do they do?
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.000]   And and what did some of your testing, you know, show that, you know, what was the results?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.920]   Yep, sounds great. Yeah, so the
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.480]   LOG relief booster, I would rather have you talk about it
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.800]   but I'm gonna do the intro and then you just add whatever I have them covered because maybe you talk a little bit about
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.280]   what's in there and what you've used and
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.160]   Again for everybody here. So the case is just amazing and finding some of these
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:11.880]   use cases where you could apply this technology and create a
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.600]   frequency that really helps in real life then versus taking
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.800]   tons of supplements and possibly other medication, right? So
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.200]   He created this and so I'm just telling you the story on how this happens. He sent me the
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.960]   the frequency and then
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.400]   we actually added
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.960]   or we we were
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:41.360]   burning it in a second generation infinity blog
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:48.640]   so that the frequency is even more available and then we tested them and the very first test was actually a
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.400]   lady that
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.240]   Has really really bad allergies and when she has allergies
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.560]   She literally can't do anything and just needs to stay at home
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.680]   so
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.340]   She got that card and that was like one of those people that
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:11.560]   You know, you saw her a card and she's like, okay, so what's that? No, right?
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:18.600]   Doesn't believe in energy and frequencies or any of that at all like literally at all and I was like
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:24.920]   Hey, could you just you know just keep it in your pocket like maybe for an hour or so and just let me know if it does anything and
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.600]   it literally took just I
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.080]   Think like 20 minutes and it started that her nose started to free up. She felt a lot better her eyes
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:41.640]   Were clearing and she suddenly felt like she can she can breathe again and she felt a real relief with this and
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:48.120]   So the the quitting sense of that was that she actually asked me if she she could have this card
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:56.560]   So yes, I actually then gave her a card and then I actually asked her also a couple weeks later. So okay, so how
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.420]   Did this progress did you know? Did you continue to have good results or was it just you know?
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:09.440]   Instant at first and then it went away and no and she said every time she's using the card
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.800]   She's feeling so much better and it has a real effect and on
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.040]   Yeah, she
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.160]   She was absolutely impressed actually by that that was a real
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:26.960]   Like shift in her mind even because she had no clue that something like this would even exist could even work
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.300]   And she didn't believe it. So that also means like you don't have to believe in it and afford to still work
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:39.200]   Maybe it works better if you believe in it even better, but it does work for those people too. Yeah, that's great
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.240]   I'm really happy about that one because I did a video of I don't know a couple months ago
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.220]   Where I was just tinkering in my my lab
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:51.060]   And I don't know for those of you guys who don't know I'm you know, I'm Kay O'er and
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.720]   And I think her around with with all these little you know things and so
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.200]   A booster is is when I take and I basically experiment with different
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.280]   Supplements and different
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.960]   Sometimes medication I really try to stay away from pharma stuff
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.540]   but the idea though is that there's different kinds of frequencies and
[00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.480]   And where Phillip is like, you know, the expert is in etheric frequencies, right?
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.760]   And then but there's molecular frequencies that come from physical substances
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.600]   And then there's resonant frequencies that come from sound and I haven't even even gotten to that area yet
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.360]   That's that area right there is is like a giant universal by itself
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.800]   I have yet to tinker and wait till I do right?
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:38.880]   But so what I've been doing and when you see the word booster, you know, what I do is I just I just do a ton of research for weeks and weeks
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.880]   I read up about every possible
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:48.240]   You know natural substance I try to do like 99.9% natural substances, you know, because I'm really big on supplements
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.480]   And I'm just like okay. Well, let's say, you know, like the testosterone booster
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.680]   I put that one together the woman's booster and so forth
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:11:02.220]   But anyway, when you see the word booster, it means molecular frequencies from actual physical substances that I've captured using the Lele quantum tech
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.000]   technology
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:11.360]   And I've just created a frequency set based on the best advice about what the combinations are so for the allergy relief
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:17.080]   I think there's like a 12 or something a 10 or 12 different substances in there
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:22.160]   From all of the research that I did that said hey, this is the absolute best stuff
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:28.120]   you know things like nettle marshmallow root, you know, and and these are things that
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:33.440]   For a yarns people have been using to help relieve symptoms of allergies, you know
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.040]   And I put them all together and I created this frequency set and I'm just thrilled
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:43.240]   That's someone found a benefit from it. So that's great. So anyway, that's one of the new ones
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:50.840]   That came from some of the tinkering that I've been doing and then so but there are a couple more, right? That have come from the heather network
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.000]   The yes, and by the way for everybody that may wonder right now
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.180]   So the allergy relief booster as well as the forever young frequency that we're getting into now are
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:09.640]   Available on the website as of today. So they're they're live there. You can find them read through them and
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:18.560]   the happiness one that is listed here is not yet available so that will probably take another two weeks and
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.640]   it's actually an
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:30.120]   Additional healer in our network. That's not listed on the website yet because we were expanding that network. So we're having two more
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:36.400]   That will add over the next four weeks and one of them actually created the happiness
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:45.560]   Frequency set which I'll go into also a little bit. So starting with the forever young though. So
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.160]   forever young was
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.920]   as a frequency set was created by Sun Yaf Fisher and
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:13:00.440]   I had done an intro video with her at some point and she talked for a couple minutes
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.160]   about that frequency which is
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:08.400]   Actually one of her core competencies. So so what does that mean? So
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.320]   she's developed a few
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:17.200]   core areas that she's really really good at as a healer and
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:25.800]   this forever young theme is one that she's specialized on and
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.760]   So it's it may be hard for some people to understand
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.840]   But so I think one concept that a lot of people and a lot of your listeners understand
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.640]   By now is that the body is originally designed to heal itself
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.200]   but then there's more to it that
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:52.360]   We don't we don't necessarily need to die when we're 70 or 80 years old that that's just it's it's basically a concept
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.640]   That's really what it is. It's a concept and it's a belief and it's
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:02.720]   Because it's been happening here on earth like that. You know recently of last a few hundred years
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:09.720]   We're mirroring that to each other. That's how Roman for example would would explain it, but
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.480]   you know the soul our soul has
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.560]   These eternal and eternally young
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:23.320]   Aspects, I mean, there's also like old souls right that that's not really what I mean
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:28.680]   But there's something that is always rejuvenated and young and
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:35.360]   And this frequency set makes that come out even more so that in every cell
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:43.080]   We are getting these signals of rejuvenation and the signals of you know, we don't need to
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.160]   Be old become old in that sense
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:53.840]   It's there's always this aspect of young that can shine through us and and through our body as well
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.720]   And that's kind of what's getting activated there
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:03.480]   That is the best way for me to describe it Zunya could do it in a better way because it's really her field, but I
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:11.400]   Hope that people can understand this. Yeah, and it it works really way. So so we tested it with
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.880]   many different people actually and
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:20.600]   It works on multiple levels. So it really works on the on the physical body as well as on the energetic bodies and
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.360]   it's it's something that's
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.960]   noticeable and
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.600]   Yeah, we felt that this is something that
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.920]   Yeah, it could be a nice addition to the
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.280]   The portfolio frequencies that we have here
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:41.080]   Yeah, because there's nothing like that that we've created so far. So how would you okay?
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:48.960]   So I know that the heel frequency is the primal human healing frequency and I believe you once described it as
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.800]   like, you know primal meaning
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:57.100]   And I took it my interpretation was that it was like the spark of life, you know the spark
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.560]   That you know causes us to regenerate, right?
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:07.960]   If that's true, and then there's this other one forever young is it like there's the you know
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.500]   the primal human healing frequency is that which
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:17.400]   Causes us to regenerate and then this forever young frequency
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.880]   Is it would you say that that is the frequency that that?
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.120]   supports that and maintains that that energy once it's
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:31.360]   Established or healed or you know created so like they they work really well together. So right?
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.520]   I mean would that be right that you yes two would go really together. Yes. Oh, okay
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.440]   Yeah, I think it's a really great way of looking at it
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:46.000]   And I haven't even done that before so I'm just following and scanning that right now and and you're actually right
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   So they complement each other really well
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.080]   Where's the the nuances with the forever young is really that it it signals this?
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:02.280]   Youngness, I don't know if that's even a word, but you get what I'm saying that that is that is something that is not
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:10.220]   signaled by the by the heal frequency which activates the inner healer and really the the self-healing powers, right?
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.760]   this this works
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:19.400]   very well together, but it's more focused on the on the actual aging process, okay, and the
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.000]   the belief
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.360]   system about the aging right because a lot of that actually has to do with belief like you know
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:33.680]   Oh, yeah, most people would not believe how much that is actually an impact like it's literally
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.400]   It's it's it's quite massive
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.400]   Even though that's really hard to understand
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.160]   With the brain, but no actually
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.400]   Yeah, I know a lot of people that they just consider age a number and they're like in their 80s
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:53.000]   And that you couldn't tell if you you know you just can't tell because they don't they don't think about themselves as old people
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.920]   Whereas there are old people who think that they're old people and they certainly behave and look and
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.880]   die young, you know in my mind, but yeah, okay, that's okay
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.760]   So that's just trying to put it in my head like where that what that is and okay
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.560]   That makes a lot of sense and just as a fyi to anyone that's new
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.720]   the woman's booster and the men's booster have a
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.600]   molecular
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:20.920]   frequency set for anti aging that has the frequency of supplements like
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.840]   N&M rizvara tall carnosine and so forth
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:30.320]   So so like that would also probably be something that would be a good combination as well. Okay
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:39.360]   Fascinating. Yes, and what I actually think is that the forever young frequency goes really well with the use of C 60
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:46.200]   I don't want to talk too much about C 60 right now, but that's I think an area where it could even
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.760]   Get a little bit amplified or it would amplify each other
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:54.280]   Alright, okay. That's a great idea. I didn't think of that. Okay
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.880]   Alright, cool. So okay. So now happiness. No wait
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:03.600]   So forever young came from Sonya happiness came from a new healer. That's gonna be added to the network
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.280]   So I mean obviously the word happiness kind of connotates what it is
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:14.060]   But could you elaborate on that like like what is this frequency like what what what are people reporting?
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.980]   Who are you know cuz all of these frequencies right get tested before they get put on the website?
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.780]   So only the good ones come out by the way, I have failures that fill ups never put on
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.600]   For those of you track. I have failures
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.360]   I created video or frequency sets that never made the cut so you know there's a process
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:39.720]   And they go through this test phase and unless you know it gets a positive feedback
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.440]   You know, we just toss them and start over so so how does how did happiness work out?
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:52.920]   Yeah, so that's actually interesting because I I wondered myself why we actually started so late with
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.840]   Developing this one because in the scheme of things
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.400]   happiness is so important and
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:05.960]   There are different ways of looking at happiness, but
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.640]   For example, David Hawkins would describe happiness is the ultimate
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:18.600]   Level you're in and that you that you represent basically when your consciousness is fully
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.720]   built out
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.720]   by the way, so
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.780]   Happiness as a state that that's something to
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:31.440]   To be mindful we want to be happy also. We are also here to be happy right where yeah
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.440]   There's this concept of yes, you know life is here to do actually suffer through it
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:43.600]   Actually, we are happiness. There's there's this aspect of happiness within us and we can
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:50.640]   We can feel that we can access that and we can expand that and yeah, you know things may be
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:57.200]   Difficult in the outer life and everything but that that doesn't necessarily need to impact this
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:07.520]   This river of happiness that flows through us, right? We we let that impact that river that that's what's happening and to actually
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:15.320]   Bring that into real flow again and into a more dominant position within our lives
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:20.520]   That is what this frequency does. So that's again a frequency that
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.880]   It's it's not, you know, you take this card put it in your pocket for five minutes
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:30.600]   And you'll be the happiest person on earth for the rest of your life. No, it's one that actually
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.000]   helps you
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.040]   To get there and and work through stuff. So it's again this
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:45.280]   Little inner healer in your pocket that I've talked about before how these frequencies work that are created there
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.480]   It really if you have the intention that you you want to create more happiness in your life
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.120]   Then that would be a fantastic card to work with
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:22:01.440]   And to support you that's how I can explain it and we'll have a video though at some point once once we
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:09.680]   Probably in the next three weeks or something like that. I'll have a quick intro with that specific healer and
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:16.600]   Then she can also talk a little bit about it and go into a little bit more depth
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:23.720]   Okay. All right. So yeah, okay. Okay. So let me see if I got it right because you know, you were talking in the chat group
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:30.160]   I believe last week about the inner peace frequency and and and all of these frequencies are not like
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:36.000]   They're not the actual frequency like all of a sudden I'm gonna be happy
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.360]   But these are enablers right these are things that these frequencies in the way the energy works if I'm correct, right?
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.280]   Let me know if I'm not but the way I interpret them is that they enable us
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:54.880]   To to allow ourselves to be happy because there's so many people out there that just don't feel like they should be happy or
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.440]   There's so many people out there that can't that can't you know, let themselves
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:07.560]   Feel inner peace because they're so you know, they're they did their minds won't quiet enough to allow themselves
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:13.160]   So they are themselves or they're the worst enemy basically and we we all are like that right with all of our you know
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.080]   We're all like, you know, like cliff. I always calls us the monkey mind
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.360]   But you know, it's true
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:23.680]   We are you know, we're sort of 3d creatures and we kind of are detrimental to ourselves in multiple different ways
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.360]   And but these frequencies right they they enable that to kind of like hey
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:32.960]   Let that stuff go and and allow yourself to be happy allow yourself to find inner peace, right?
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.600]   Is that kind of and that's really how it works, right? So these aren't like here's it exactly yes
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.120]   But more so here's something to help you find it
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.800]   Right, so it's more. Yes, that is correct. Yeah, okay
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.680]   But I want to still mention that you know, most people if they take the inner peace card for example
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.240]   They feel actually an instant change
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:59.560]   So it's not that they that you you won't have an instant change or or something instant that you can feel or access better
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.080]   So most people actually have that and can find that
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:08.760]   But to find that on a deeper level and establish it in a way where we can
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.760]   You know recreated and really have it be a part of our
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.720]   usual life and being
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:20.080]   That is what that is supposed to enable you to
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:26.640]   Yeah, okay. Yeah, cuz you know, I got it like when you described that that concept
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:32.160]   You were describing it to somebody like how inner peace worked and and I just want I want to share that
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:38.160]   That when I use inner peace, it's usually when I'm I'm in some kind of a conflict
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.800]   you know internal conflict and
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.760]   It's really funny how when I'm in a conflict like that. I'm drawn to that
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:50.880]   I'm literally drawn to that I have different capsules and I'm drawn to my inner peace capsule. It's kind of like my
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:57.000]   Just my intuition says it use that one and I'll wear that one and it's just amazing to me
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.200]   how
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.800]   It just seems like the blockages towards
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.200]   Being able to work through this situation kind of go away
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.000]   I'm able to kind of focus on it and because I'm able to focus on it
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.280]   I'm able to then center myself and then let go, you know
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.080]   That's kind of how I use inner peace and then I also use heel
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.120]   For the same way, but usually when I'm when I have a physical issue
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:25.880]   I will use heel and then I just it just always makes me feel better. It's really weird. I don't know how if that's how you are too, but
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.240]   To me like through like these are like emotional or spiritual golf clubs
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:36.320]   Right and it depends on how I feel or what I'm going through
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.280]   But I'll just grab one and but then I also have a day every day carry
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.400]   I mean, I don't know if you have one
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:47.360]   But if you have like this is my go-to every day unless something's going on and that's my one capsule that I'll always wear
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.760]   This is funny, but yeah, I mean I've really come to just totally
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:56.520]   Truly enjoy and for those of you who haven't even tried one. I mean, I highly recommend just try one
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:03.280]   But these these frequencies really do are their energetic frequencies and they actually they actually
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:11.000]   Manifested in reality in on our 3d reality. So yeah, I'm looking forward to trying out the happiness one. That sounds awesome
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.960]   So let me ask you a question, you know, I was kind of going back and for those of you playing at home
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:22.320]   Back in October of 2020 Philip, and I did the first
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:29.680]   Video nine months ago when when the website first came out and we and to explain like what the frequencies were
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.840]   There was like 14 frequencies at the time. I'll put a link in the video description of this video
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:42.320]   This was the first video about you know asking Philip. Hey, could you explain, you know what these frequencies do and what they are?
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.760]   And so now that there was 14 back then but then you know, there's like 22 now with the three new ones
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:52.960]   So I'm just wondering like since October till now, obviously you've added more frequencies
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:58.600]   So maybe you know what you know, could you could just touch on like so? Hey, how are they going? How are they doing?
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.600]   I mean, you've got the new weight loss one
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:06.760]   testosterone boosters the D&L DNA one and how are those coming along in terms of
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:12.560]   You know feedback, you know, I just I'm just I'm always curious to see how now that they're out there and people are using them
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:17.520]   I mean, what are you hearing and and what are your what are your experiences so far and just you know
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:22.400]   Let's start with yeah, so yeah, you know, like this one especially I think we'll have to pick a specific one
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:29.080]   That's definitely the hey and self-support yet. Yeah, the DNA so that's obviously the hottest topic of our generation
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.480]   So how let's start with that one. Yeah
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:36.680]   Yeah, we've actually had a hard time and keeping up with production with
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.960]   Few weeks
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.480]   Yeah, and especially because we had this special
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:49.000]   Where you could get four of those DNA and cell protector cards for?
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.680]   basically the price of one and
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:59.280]   Yeah, it's it's it's going really well and people have amazing results with it. We actually
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.040]   they had a few hundred of those that were
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.720]   You know purchased by
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.320]   Several healers and that they would actually
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.800]   distribute it to their
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.520]   To their people that they they work with
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.480]   basically to help them and
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:27.000]   So we have we have a lot of feedback in regards to this specific card
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:34.660]   From a lot of people that can see and sense energy and and whose job it is basically to help other people
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:42.240]   With energy work. So that are you know I'm going beyond our network right now because you know
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.800]   They've tested that anyway, but I'm really I'm talking about
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.480]   other people here and
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.520]   Yeah, it gives people
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:57.880]   So so you know, how can I explain a sum of the people that can sense it on a physical level?
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.600]   they really feel that their cells feel stronger and
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.640]   You know, it's really hard for
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:11.200]   You know a normal person to feel okay. What what's going on with the DNA, right?
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.880]   So that that is really a hard one to actually
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.320]   See is you need to have like a Roman to see that?
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:23.040]   But there there's some of those healers. They said it was as if like a
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.880]   Like a golden light basically
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:34.240]   Was all around the whole
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:40.640]   Cell and DNA system as if there's like a layer of protection
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.200]   not a layer of
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:51.760]   Distance right it's not not like a wall where nothing gets through we're no where everything can still freely
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:59.300]   Communicate in everything but this protection layer to not let any of these detrimental frequencies in that are coming with
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.400]   You know those
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:08.280]   Substances that we don't mention here. Yeah, but that everybody knows we're talking about. Yeah
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:16.640]   Hey, you know, so I'm interested, you know, cuz I'm always coming from the the left field in terms of the science aspect of this
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.520]   You know, you know, you know traditional science, but I'm just wondering like, you know
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.120]   I know that the initial testing of that frequency set you had discovered
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:32.200]   I know that you've you told me the story of one person who I had been exposed to people who had you know
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:37.940]   Went ahead and accepted the procedure and that person had then had detrimental
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:43.300]   female issues because of their exposure and that the this frequency
[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:47.680]   Basically stopped that and made and brought her back to normal
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:52.920]   Have that has that been repeated now with other folks, you know, are more women now
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:57.100]   Using this and finding that they're going back to normal after exposure
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:06.440]   Yes, that's what we've been hearing. Oh, yes, but it's not only the ones that that that were just exposed by
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.880]   You know, like a physical exchange with some person that had gotten
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.040]   The jab but but really the ones also that indeed
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:24.360]   Um, you know got got the needle basically because that that's actually where where it gets worse and we've
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.520]   We've been, you know, actively proactively testing
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:34.240]   That over a six month period and we went as far as someone that had
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.160]   gotten the first one
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:46.400]   Three and a half weeks before they were able to get this frequency card and then the frequency card was able to
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.240]   neutralize all of the
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:56.720]   Determinal effects that were visible at that time already because those three and a half weeks had done already damage and
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.680]   But so we don't know anything
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:06.200]   Beyond that, right? So what if you you know took it six weeks ago and now we were thinking about the frequency card
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.800]   It's most likely going to help you quite significantly
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.600]   But will it be able to reverse all of it?
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.640]   You know, I have no clue. We just don't know that it's not been tested
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:22.960]   But but with all those other people. Yeah, those those results have been extremely positive and things
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.320]   You know have regulated out
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:29.280]   Yeah, no, that's that's great to hear. I personally
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.640]   Added that frequency to my daily carry
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.600]   so that because I'm more afraid of
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.760]   Shed, you know, you know shatters. Yeah, because I'm not gonna ever take that
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:47.960]   Stuff so but I'm around people who did and and I'm that's what I worry about but no, that's great to hear
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.560]   I think that's what people are very interested in hearing so for those of you out there playing at home
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:59.000]   It's working and the anecdotal feedback has been positive. So that's awesome. So some of the other
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.680]   Yeah, yeah, I think I think that's how I use it
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:11.280]   Everybody know every time it's the daily carry every time I go into town or you know went to the hairdresser the other day
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.880]   And when I go grocery shopping
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.600]   That's when I wear it, you know when when I'm just you know
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:23.280]   Around the normal people I interact with that, you know, I don't need to worry about or I'm at home
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.840]   In my office. I
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.800]   Sometimes actually also use it just you know when I have the impulse to but usually
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:36.160]   Really then when I when I go to town then I always word. Yeah when I'm around people me too
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.720]   Okay, so let's so okay
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.080]   So some of you know, let's talk about a couple other new ones and then jump into the FAQs
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.560]   Obviously the second biggest issue in our in our generation is weight loss
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:53.840]   It's like every every commercial on TV is like either take a drug or lose some way, right?
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.640]   So how is that one coming along because I personally love that day
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.760]   It's just you know
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:04.800]   It's just it's literally one of the first frequencies that I can physically feel because I literally physically don't want to eat
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.480]   I just kind of like don't care about food
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:11.080]   But I'm a foodie so I don't carry that one around a lot because I want to enjoy food
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:16.440]   But I know that if when I carry that one I literally like don't care like foods like in consequential
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.360]   Which has been it's really strange for me as a foodie, but I don't care about food
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.720]   So I kind of use that one sparingly
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:28.600]   But I mean are other people like I mean because I've seen some of the feedback and the people are actually out there losing weight
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.080]   I mean what's been the other feedback that you're hearing?
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.640]   Yeah, it's it's actually
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:41.840]   Very very positive and so I don't watch TV. I haven't watched TV in a very very very long time
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:49.440]   So I don't know anything about any way does commercials, but I can certainly relate to that right because there's I mean
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:57.120]   I I we figured you know when we wanted to do this test so we tested this in a relatively small circle of maybe
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:04.100]   six people or so at first and after we looked at it energetically and saw that it
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:09.640]   Really worked and helped but the thing with weight loss is that there's so many different
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.320]   reasons to why and then there's so many different
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:22.000]   Body types and character types for for this specific one to work. We wanted to make sure that we go through
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.760]   even more extensive testing and
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:30.640]   Then we came up, you know with this broader test where also we invited
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.560]   people from the telegram group and
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.320]   the interest was just
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.880]   big really really big every you know a lot of people apparently had
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:50.560]   Issues with that or had an interest and needed some some support and and and how glad also right because you know
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.360]   Taking something. I mean again. I don't know anything about
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:36:01.520]   TV commercials anymore, but I would assume those are typically some chemicals that you take and you know
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:07.800]   From what I know from the past. It's it's usually something you take that it has some side effects also and then
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:12.760]   You bounce back relatively quickly anyway, that may not be true for everything
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:18.680]   So I don't want to make a presumptions. However, this this one works in a little bit different way
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:23.080]   So it it does require one's commitment
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:28.880]   And intention so you know for first and foremost that intention. I think that is
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.360]   That is a good one to have if you have a little bit of commitment also
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:39.240]   I think that that goes well and then it'll really support you in in in various ways
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:43.000]   even if you don't have that commitment and then it intention it'll
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.760]   visibly
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.760]   help you with
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.880]   Reducing the craving so you'll have less craving
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:57.960]   But it will be amplified if you bring that intention and commitment with you
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.200]   That's what we found across the board
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:11.080]   The metabolism is actually stimulated through this frequency as well, which is a nice added benefit to it and then there are
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.480]   certain
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:21.800]   Different issues sometimes to why we actually eat too much or not are not able to
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.040]   You know
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.680]   transform the food we eat into
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:36.640]   readily available energy and then rather stored and you know, just can't lose weight so there's some
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:44.920]   Aspects that this frequency covers as well that that helps with those things and yes the reports have been
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:52.880]   Phenomenal across that that field test as well as now after we've launched it a lot of people are very happy
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:38:00.840]   With this card and you know say similar things that you said and and and they they they love to have something like that
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:06.440]   Like it's almost as if they have a journey, you know, they may say okay for the next three weeks, you know, I'm going to
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.640]   Yeah tackle this and then and then they
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.520]   Yeah, and then they use this as a tool
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:19.760]   To get through this and it it really helps them to get through this and then it's kind of funny
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:26.680]   So Agni is actually the one that had created this this frequency and he created it for himself
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:33.920]   Originally, so and then we actually started talking to him about it. No, like hey, you know, and what do you think?
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:41.600]   So we should maybe you know test this and all that that's how it came about and and he still uses it today because right now
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:46.100]   He's actually for a for a whole three weeks. He's not eating anything
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:52.160]   And I think he needs to never 10 days or something like that
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:39:01.080]   Is to go but he's using this frequency to you know, just it's just easier, you know, he's not you know, he
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:08.720]   The he has such a great mind and consciousness and all of that and he could also do it without the frequency
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.680]   Obviously, but hey, you know, if you can have a little help
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:18.840]   In addition, so he's using that that same frequency also. So yeah, that's how you know, it works
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.040]   No, I'm glad I'm talking to you about it because I never thought about it that way out, you know, because
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:27.840]   Yeah, you're right. I mean if you want to do like a specific time like these three weeks
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.000]   I'm gonna just try to do a fat or whatever, right?
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.600]   Then that's the best time to pull that golf club out of your pack, you know, and and carry it around so it's like a
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:44.840]   like a target specific frequency you use when you need it and want it but not something you'd carry around all the time because
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.320]   It's gonna ruin your ability to you know enjoy food, which is my that was my point
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:54.720]   But you know, hey, but this is cool. All right. Well that wraps up part one on on the new frequencies
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:59.640]   And we're gonna go ahead and I'm gonna put the link below to part two for the frequently asked questions
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:05.520]   I want to say a big mahalo and thank you very much to Philip for you know for participating on this conversation
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.880]   I think it's really helpful to bring, you know, the guy
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:14.280]   Onto a video and and really just say hey, you know, what are these all about because there's no way I could use
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:19.280]   You know, I find all of the words to kind of explain all these new frequencies and what they do
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:25.720]   So I'll go ahead and then if you you know when you have time and if you're interested in your user or customer of of lay the queue
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:32.160]   Part two is where we're gonna get into those FAQs and the very first one is about frequencies and mixing and matching
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.520]   We know we I know we touched a little bit about that in part one
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:39.600]   But we get a lot more in depth in part two on the frequency frequently asked questions
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.880]   So thank you very much for listening and for those of you
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.840]   You know, if you want to get ahold of us
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:51.720]   You can get ahold of Philip at lay the quantum tech or also in the in the quantum power group on telegram links below in the video description
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.580]   And if you need to get ahold of me, I want to see what else I'm doing. I have a blog
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:58.800]   In addition to this YouTube channel and I'm over at takers.academy
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:03.200]   And you just put that in your you were all window and my blog pops up. So that's who I am
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:10.760]   Kay Elmer. I'm with the takers Academy Phillips with Layla quantum tech. Thank you very much for watching this video and have an awesome day. Aloha
