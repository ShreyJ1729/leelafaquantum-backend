[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Hello and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K Almer and
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.600]   this is just a simple ad-hoc video because I'm doing something and I thought I'd
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.080]   just share it. This is my supplement routine and so what I usually do is I
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.760]   set out about a month's worth of my vitamins and cups makes it really easy
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.840]   every morning enough to deal with it you know I just go ahead and grab a cup and
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.120]   take it along with my protein shake but what I kind of want to share is after
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.520]   decades of research I just want to kind of just convey to everybody that you know
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.240]   I've not had a sick day at work for over four years and even better results over
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.720]   the last ten years after it basically just stopped dealing with alopads and
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.240]   started taking care of my own health through supplementation instead of
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.760]   medication and that has absolutely reduced I'm sorry not reduced but
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.960]   reversed all of my prior condition so over 15 20 years ago I had problems with
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.080]   anemia, eczema, hypertension and high cholesterol, borderline, diabetic right so
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.740]   15 years ago I figured all the medications after I'd been treated for 10 years by
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.600]   alopads I had shown zero improvement all my numbers remain the same and if
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.080]   anything my doctor just wanted to pump more chemicals into me so I kind of just
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.400]   fired her through everything away and started studying supplementation so this
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.120]   is kind of a real quick and dirty what do I do to supplement so that I don't have
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.640]   ever ever really honestly never go to an alopath for any type of illness whatsoever
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.800]   like I said I haven't had a sick day in least four years minimum you know six
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.560]   years maybe so the idea here though is that you know what I've learned over the
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.480]   last couple of decades by basically taking over my own health and in taking
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.080]   things that are good for me instead of things that are bad for me instead of
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.720]   trying to plug the treatments or I'm sorry plug the problems with medication
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.120]   instead staying healthy and taking the right supplements has been my avenue
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.400]   towards health and so it is expensive it is almost the same you know like you
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.140]   still got to take these things every day like you would do drugs but the drugs
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.040]   have all these side effects and they never cure your problem so I'm telling
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.920]   you right now I have cured my problems by simply doing multi supplementation and
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.720]   then at the end of the day if you did the research you'll find out that your
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.960]   food supply will never give you everything your body needs period end of
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.960]   subject you cannot eat enough to get all of the things that your body needs on a
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.920]   daily basis and that's why bottom line is you know nutrient nutritional
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.960]   deficiencies is probably one of the leading causes of disease and problems
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.440]   so anyway this is what I do I set out my cups and in doing so just I was just
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.880]   doing it so I thought I'd go hey you know let me split up the supplements that I
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.040]   put in the cups and to give you an idea of like what my focus is so I figured
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.360]   you might find that interesting so first of all this pile right here is just
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.160]   your basic vitamins vitamins and the things that you need and so I want to
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.240]   kind of point out one thing is that I do take a just your standard old you know
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.040]   vegan non-GMO multi and if you look at the multi you know they're shooting at
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.880]   any one of multi's they're gonna go with the RDA and the RDA is recommend daily
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.000]   allowance and it's it's it's set by the alipas and so it's in my opinion it's
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.480]   absolutely a worthless metric to go by in terms of what your daily allowance
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.800]   should be and if you want to really understand that take a look at vitamin
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.240]   C and what the recommended daily allowances for that which is essentially
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.040]   the same amount of vitamin C that guinea pig would have and think how much bigger
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.240]   you are than a guinea pig and how much more you're probably gonna need long
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.240]   story short so I take a multi just to get the very basics but I do I do supplement
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.000]   additional magnesium sorbet that's the vitamin C there vitamin K to go along
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.080]   with the vitamin D but this probably is the most important thing you could be
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.960]   taking for yourself honestly if you did the research on this and if you're going
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.400]   to take vitamin D obviously you need to take vitamin K they go together obviously
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.240]   I do supplement extra vitamin B's they're really super important and that
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.960]   borderline anemia yeah gone just take a natural organic iron do not take fair
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.320]   sulfate that is a mineral take iron that was basically derived from plants
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.920]   that's the natural way to do it that's how your body reacts vitamin E interesting
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.800]   thing about vitamin E as these multis if you look at the vitamin E and here's
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.680]   only one version of vitamin E there's actually eight different types of
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.200]   vitamin E in nature so that's why I take a full-spectrum vitamin E to get all of
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.520]   them that's what your body needs it comes from nature iodine critical iodine is
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.600]   another critical supplement you should take that is literally part of your
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.280]   everyday this is if you're gonna take anything like a normal person would just
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.600]   take this stuff right here right you know in terms of just your standard
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.480]   vitamins minerals and the things your body needs to run on but I and iodine I
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.120]   can't stress enough and then here's a vitamin B 17 I challenge everyone out
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.760]   there who doesn't know about vitamin B 17 and go look and every one of your
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.480]   little multivitamins and see if you can find it in there and you will find out
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:10.200]   that the mainstream health care industry has taken vitamin 17 out of your diet
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.280]   it's not in your food it's not in your multis and why is that a lot of study on
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.920]   that this is also known as leitral so supplement on vitamin 17 you have to
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.360]   take it or you're not going to get any and your body guess what it's a vitamin
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.520]   it needs it so that's just the standard and so then the rest of this is kind of
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:36.120]   like what I take given my age to maintain the energy maintain cognitive
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.160]   function maintain testosterone and all of that and also for detoxing so I won't
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.800]   get into every single one of these but in the bottom line though is that if
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.480]   you're at aging and you're suffering from the ravages of aging you can't just
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.000]   rely on just what your body needs every single day you might want to boost it up
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.320]   a little bit so you know just some real quick stuff I think the most important
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.240]   thing of the thing I've got the most benefit out of is lion's mane for the
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.880]   brain I really like PQQ for brain also too from a detox standpoint you really
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.680]   need to take these two glutathione our alpoc lipolipoc acid these are really
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.000]   going to help your liver detox and your or all we are all really living in a
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.040]   toxic environment so daily detoxing is important so supplement for detox that's
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.760]   what I do and then also to from the anti-aging standpoint you know get the
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.800]   N&M and Riz Veratol that's a definite must silica huge deal with silica your
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.640]   brain needs silica otherwise it's going to suck in the aluminum from your
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.440]   environment and you're going to get heavy metal poisoning in your brain
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:49.080]   curcumin anti cancer etc etc Tomcat Ali excellent for testosterone etc so this
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.900]   is you know just wanted to share that with you and then sort of like my my
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.720]   general approach towards anti-aging and boosting testosterone and boosting
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.000]   cognitive function blah blah is I don't always take the same thing so I have
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.680]   all these other supplements that I kind of have and I kind of mix and match every
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.320]   time I make my cups so I kind of just you know I always try to do something
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.040]   different and that's because you want to keep your body in a
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.960]   harmonic state meaning that you don't want to do the same thing every single
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.360]   day every after day after day otherwise your body gets used to it and then so
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.080]   you want to just kind of shake it up a bit so I don't actually have the same
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.000]   combination every I always do this but this right here is a different combination
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.080]   every single time I make the cups so that I get a little bit of the
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.320]   hormetic response from my body so that I'm not always taking the same thing from
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.800]   the standpoint of boosting all that stuff so and I also add new stuff so right
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.680]   now I'm just kind of trying out a couple of new things
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.680]   Fizetin is a really good for anti-aging so I thought I'd give that a try and
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.960]   this guy right here is something I just came across which is I'm gonna see I'm
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.080]   gonna try to pronounce this Paul Mitala thol mny mny mny mny mny or P for
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.520]   short this is found recent studies has shown that this is an exceptional
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.080]   anti-inflammatory so why that's important well you know what your body
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.200]   because of all the toxins we live in and the environment we live in you know
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.760]   we're very quite toxic so you definitely need to be you know detoxing it out but
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.800]   also too it causes inflammation so having something for inflammation is
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.320]   really helpful and I've got other stuff there too for inflammation I also got
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.360]   other things for brain and then of course I just want to point this out this was
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.960]   the what I kind of got I've been taking this for over now 15 years now so
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:31.720]   Triline and I basically there's a really exceptional book out there sorry
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.880]   don't remember the name of it at the top of my head but bottom line it just kind
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:41.800]   of tied how to keep your body able to process out all that cholesterol build
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.560]   up in your veins and your body has a natural you know a method for that it's
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.760]   called l-arginine and l-centriline stimulates the body's producing
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.720]   production of l-arginine and that and what that did was this cured my cholesterol
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.800]   problem along with guess what something as simple as cinnamon so these are like
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.840]   for cholesterol these are for brain these are for detox these are for brain
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.680]   this is for anti-cancer etc etc so the idea here though is that I just wanted
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.640]   to share with you how I do it and give you something to think about that you
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.840]   know hey you need to really kind of you know do your daily thing this is just to
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.360]   keep you going and keep you alive and this is to boost all the things that you
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.040]   might have weaknesses for your environments causing problems for you and
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.680]   so forth so you know that's just kind of I just wanted to share that because I
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.600]   just happen to be doing it this morning and it's Sunday February 26 so I've
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.760]   just said hey you know let's grab a camera and let's go ahead and show you
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.080]   guys this and then in addition to this I do supplement on molecular hydrogen and
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.000]   oxygen therapy through a process called browns gas so I'm as I'm sitting at my
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.720]   desk every day while at work I've got my generator going so I'm inhaling browns
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.760]   gas which is also hydroxy oxygen or H-H-O and that gives you molecular
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.680]   hydrogen that gives you oxygen and that's in a very healthy for you from a
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:03.040]   standpoint of supplementation through gas I also take C-60 and C-60 oil C-60 is
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:09.440]   also an anti-inflammatory and then I do on occasion once a week or twice a week
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:14.840]   I'll take a probiotic that'll also help my gut biome that's another thing that's
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.320]   really important that doesn't come in any of this stuff is making sure you have
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.640]   a really good strong gut biome so I definitely take a probiotic and then
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.940]   right here when I make my protein shakes this jar right here it's
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.200]   Vasilium husks and that's really critical as a prebiotic to feed your
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.760]   gut flora so that your feed your gut flora keeps them happy and then you keep
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.280]   them replenished as you're getting wiped out from all the stuff that's in our
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.600]   environment with probiotics so prebiotics and probiotics don't forget the
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.320]   pre and it's not just probiotics in this little jar I just kind of keep my
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:51.160]   Sheila's eat this is an Ayurvedic also known as mountain poo and it's basically
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.000]   every possible mineral in the world that your body is going to need is all in
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.680]   one thing because you're not going to get all your minerals I mean all like
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.400]   things like 80 different minerals our bodies need and this stuff right here is
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:08.280]   literally extracted from like the rocks in the minerals and mountains and and so
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.040]   it's called a Sheila's eat and this is probably one of the most powerful
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.640]   minerals you could take I add that to my money shake every day so with all that
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:21.960]   in mind this is how K Almer has avoided doctors for over 10 years and I stay
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.720]   sharp I'm on top of my game I have a very intense mental job where I need to
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.280]   have my brain switched on and sit in meetings four to six hours a day which
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.960]   is life-sucking zoom meetings and then on top of that have to get my work done
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.640]   and the only way I can pull that off is with all of this if I don't take this
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.000]   for a week I struggle and so this is why I do this not only for my own health
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.480]   but for health and then for performance so there you go just wanted to share
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.280]   that with you I know we all do it a different way and I know that I'm I'm
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.120]   always curious to see how other people do it so if you've got anything to share
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.600]   please share it and look forward to hearing from you by the way I do have a
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.680]   new health and healing telegram chat group where we kind of discuss all
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.520]   this kind of stuff plus a lot more about health and healing so if you're
