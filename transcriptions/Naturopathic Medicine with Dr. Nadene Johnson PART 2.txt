[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.200]   Kalmer and in this video I'd like to share with you part two of a
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.600]   fascinating discussion I had with Dr. Nadine Johnson who holds
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.840]   who's a naturopathic medicine physician in the state of Illinois.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.960]   Now she holds a doctorate in naturopathic medicine
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.640]   from the National University of Health Science. She's board certified as a
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.120]   naturopathic physician in the state of Illinois
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.960]   and also holds a master of science in acupuncture and is a licensed
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.800]   acupuncturist in the state of Illinois as well where she practices.
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.000]   Now we had this great discussion this is part two
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.120]   in part one we had this wonderful discussion about you know what is
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.920]   naturopathic medicine how does it work you know what to
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.520]   expect if you wanted to try it and some great stories of some of the
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.680]   successes that she's found in her career and she's one of those gifted
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.040]   souls who spent you know her lifetime's work is to
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.120]   help others and she's just so full of knowledge it's just an amazing
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.280]   discussion I'm so you know I feel so fortunate to have been able to spend
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.360]   time with her. So now part two now if you're interested
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.560]   is where we really get into the just her
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.960]   recommendations on all of the you know various important supplements that are
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.920]   key to your core functioning of your body and there's core processes within
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.800]   your body and the specific types of things
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.880]   to take supplement wise or to just how to live your life
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.040]   for optimum health and wellness and this is a great discussion for those of you
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.400]   who are who are interested in taking supplements and are really
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.040]   you know focused on living a healthy life and so this
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.920]   is part two where we get it into that in detail
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.480]   and I'm just really you know just really thankful again
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.440]   you know thank you again to Dr. Johnson for joining me
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.600]   and I just want to say thank you to you and come on and I'll go ahead and start
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.840]   the the interview thank you a lot. Yeah the whole
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.760]   neural thing okay I just think there's so many follow
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.560]   questions then speaking to you is like a like a treat for me
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.040]   okay so yeah I get that I mean that's the huge part
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.000]   of our health and you know all the research I've done is you know the body
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.120]   needs like 80 or 90 minerals and today all of the process foods
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.080]   all use the same you know potassium nitrate something else
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.200]   fertilizer right there's only three minerals in the
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.120]   modern agriculture fertilizer there's only three of those minerals that
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.920]   all the soil has been depleted because they don't practice
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.480]   good permaculture so all of the food in the grocery store is mineral
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.280]   depleted and so you know if you live off of that you're going to just get
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.800]   sicker and sicker and sicker so so you know so on the topic of
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.000]   minerals what is your recommendation for the
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   best source of a really good mineral supplement because like I just
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.680]   have gone I just recently switched from
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.800]   taking Sheila's eat and I switched over to CMOS because I was doing some
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.000]   research and I've also looked at Moringa but you know what do you
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.960]   would wreck would you do you have a recommendation
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.160]   and if not like what would you you know what you're
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.520]   to you know staying mineralized and how do you know if you're mineral
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.080]   deficient etc well okay everybody is mineral deficient
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.360]   okay so this is the one I agree with that
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.040]   for yeah so many other you know for so many reasons
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.920]   so I just assumed that everybody's mineral deficient
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.840]   and that means the processes in your body
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.360]   don't work correctly yeah because you need minerals as co-factors
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.640]   right and they're chelated out of your body by a bunch of things
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.680]   so my okay actually okay I have several I approach it
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.200]   several different ways I use a full of a cubic product whether
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.080]   that's full of a cubic acid Sheila's is similar I like them because
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.080]   they're macro and micro minerals full of a cubic acid
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.680]   helps chelate heavy metals out of your body it does it really gently and it
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.400]   binds it up itself and it's also a gut suitor
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.200]   so I can I can hit a bunch of targets and
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.440]   plus it helps with radiation poisoning I just found out
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.640]   so that is my go-to thing that's my base thing if that's all anybody takes
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.240]   they're golden but I want them they're going to be on it for the rest of their
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.160]   life basically right yeah I yeah cool okay because
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.680]   that's what I'm taking a full of a cubic acid it's a drink
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.600]   from Morningstar oh yeah and then and then so the Sheila
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.480]   Jito is uh the reason I stopped taking it is because I
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.800]   kept reading there's so many there's so much out there
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.080]   about counterfeits like you know the one Sheila Jito
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.280]   became popular because it wasn't popular forever I mean
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.600]   I'm a supplement junkie for well over a decade or so
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.040]   and so in the early days you know nobody even knew what it was and you
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.840]   could literally buy it and it came from India
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.080]   you know and it was hard to get and now there's so many products and it's kind
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.600]   of turned into this olive oil thing where you don't know you could just
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.160]   imagine how many counterfeits are out there because
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.520]   I think olive oil by itself is like I think it's up to 97% last I read
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.880]   is counterfeit oil and so you have to be so I buy direct from farms now
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.640]   you know it's just crazy how much of our you know health food industries have
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.960]   just been completely compromised with fakes and counterfeits so
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.240]   I kind of just kind of went well I don't know about Sheila Jean anymore
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.040]   so I switched to CMOS so what would be you know you know what do you think of
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.920]   that one yeah actually funny you should mention
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.920]   that I just started taking the CMOS triple thing with burdock and
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.280]   yeah yeah me too something else more in the other farms
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:10.640]   anyway I I really like it but I also do so my trifecta is
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.920]   the bovacumic acid then I do some form of cell salts either
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.840]   oh okay the bioplasma or I do 27 the mineral homeopathic ones that I make
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.960]   myself which has all the minerals that you could think of
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.040]   so I do that then I often will prescribe a magnesium
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.200]   supplement and I have particular ones that way
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.920]   but the other thing I'm really adamant on for a lot of people is iodine
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.440]   okay iodine is another thing that is hugely deficient in almost everybody
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.000]   especially in the Midwest and it does so many things
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.160]   including I mean it will help you with any kind of breast health
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:00.000]   ever oh yeah good I including the big CA
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.040]   yeah no that's thanks for mentioning that because
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.840]   yeah you know it's kind of I'm like I come from a
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.840]   Asian background Asian holly caught in that holly is Hawaiian for Caucasian
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.280]   I can't help using the language I was there for so long
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.720]   so I'm like in Hawaii I'm called a Hapa holly right which means you're half
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.320]   Asian half holly half caution but anyway so yeah because of that Asian
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.560]   heritage there's cons I mean just massive amounts of iodine to intake
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.320]   through Nodie and seaweeds and all of the different
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.920]   fermented seaweeds and I mean I'm just constantly you know that's why Asians
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.480]   all have darker and they don't lose their hair very often
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.840]   but um iodine okay so I got a question for you because
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.720]   I was taking liquid iodine until one day I spilled it on my counter and it was
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.240]   like the stain that never went away and so then I switched to
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.720]   Iodoro which is a cap like a tablet so is there a huge difference between
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.640]   liquid iodine supplements versus a tablet no
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:06.160]   no the Iodoro is a yeah that's a really good supplement and really
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.840]   there is somebody actually who would they say I put it in my oatmeal which
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.760]   why would you do that and it turned it black don't eat only like
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.760]   it's just a property of the compound of iodine
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.640]   yeah okay it doesn't turn your insides black
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.280]   I mean it's really good for digestion it's good for
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:32.160]   all the gonads I mean everybody should be taking it yeah
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.640]   every cell needs it not to mention the adrenals in the thyroid
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.280]   um one doctor told me he said all the blood in your body runs through your
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:46.160]   thyroid in this crazy amount of minutes he said and that's where
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.920]   the blood gets purified because of the iodine
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.560]   and I was like oh that's interesting yeah isn't it
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.880]   got the liver did that well I thought it did too but you know
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.160]   I'm continually learning stuff yeah yeah oh me too I'm literally I'm just
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.400]   I'm a I'm a junkie when it comes to just this type of information
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.480]   I just you know most people will like you know I know a lot of
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.120]   men are into sports I've never been a sports person I like to study
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.320]   stuff like this it's a weird habit I have
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.960]   but I just think it's fascinating okay so now you also mentioned
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.800]   um soil-based uh supplements clay and so
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.640]   what would what's in you are you talking edible clays right
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.760]   yeah are you talking bent tonight uh is that kind of your go-to what's your
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.120]   go-to edible clay no my go-to is this clay out of
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.960]   montanical pascalite pascalite it is it's it's a
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:55.760]   non-expanding form of bentonite so it's a calcium sodium bentonite so it
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:01.520]   doesn't it acts differently it is anti actually antimicrobial
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:08.320]   hmm there's a story where um some kid like his leg was
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.960]   absolutely crushed and they put him in a barrel of pascalite clay and it healed
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:19.680]   like in like less than two weeks no okay no deformity nothing
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.280]   so that's external and internal yeah and internal you can okay
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:29.680]   yeah it's fascinating the things you can you know you can take it internally
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.440]   and it'll act as uh uh an anti-microbial but you can put it on the skin
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.720]   you can put it on the eye you can put it in the eye
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.000]   um you can use it for pretty much anything
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.280]   okay so let me oh yeah thank you for that i'm gonna that's a great tip i'm
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.240]   gonna go buy some uh okay but here i've got a
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.240]   question for you and this has come up before and i'm never
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.480]   quite sure how to answer it you know like when you take a
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.640]   clay and you're also taking your other supplements
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.040]   um is the clay gonna chelate out your your your your
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.880]   minerals i mean you know because i know that like you
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.280]   taking other chelators and but clay binds right doesn't it bind to
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.520]   other uh like minerals and wouldn't it just wouldn't it suck the minerals out
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:17.360]   of you or is that not an issue so this the pascalite will not
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.840]   okay out the beneficial minerals but i take it away from
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.800]   other supplements uh-huh but actually if you take
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.520]   the pascalite clay with food it will moderate a food intolerance
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.760]   oh so if you're allergic to a food and you take the pascalite after
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.560]   it will help your body manage that okay so don't take it with supplements
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.800]   because that's what i i because i've learned
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.120]   um that if i because i i want to do detox but i don't want to
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:51.520]   you know basically erase out so i take supplements in the morning and then
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.160]   i usually wait 12 hours before i'll take like
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.520]   chlorella or blue green algae or or clay
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.000]   just because i don't you know i just know that i don't you know i don't i don't
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.680]   want to just erase all the benefits i just paid for
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.280]   right yeah that's perfect okay so that's like a 12-hour window
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.440]   right uh on a little tip on the allergy uh
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.600]   comment you made i um take you should look at the or if you get
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.120]   chance i know you're super busy but i take a look at the uh
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.360]   benefits of quantum healing uh video i did on allergens
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.480]   there's some remarkable discoveries being made
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.040]   in terms of quantum energy and allergens
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.240]   um i'll i'll leave it at that i'll talk to you about that afterwards
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.920]   you might find that to be quite fascinating to to me that little
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.760]   snippet there is that's that's a game changer
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.160]   so so probiotics let me ask you this i am constantly
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.520]   you know i try to i've been swapping probiotics
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.960]   um for quite some time trying to find the perfect one
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.400]   you know i kind of because i i work on the whole the whole
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.080]   hormetic thing so i i don't always take the same thing all the time every
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.560]   every three weeks i completely switch up what i'm taking
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:07.440]   and so i'll switch from you know cofiers to kombucha's to uh to actual like you
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.280]   know uh like i use this one brand called telefloral
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.680]   um it's an spio uh soil-based organism probiotic but
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.440]   what are you what are you what are you like recommendation on a really good
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:25.120]   probiotic as well as a prebiotic for gut health
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.360]   so you know all the things that you mentioned
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:35.120]   especially kefir is what i try to get people taking i try to get them taking
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.720]   natural fermented foods like um natural apple cider vinegar
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.360]   kefir kombucha kimchi you know it's a tough
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.360]   thing to get people to take fermented you know sauerkraut but fermented
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.520]   pickles anything fermented will give you
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.880]   you know thousands of more probiotics
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:03.680]   then you can get in a capsule but but you know some people you know
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.400]   just can't do it and so any of the soil-based ones
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.120]   i am happy with um i'm not too particular with them and i'm not too
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.680]   particular about prebiotics either because
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.200]   a lot of my people including me have have had digestive dishes like with the
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.080]   oligo-fructose um organ whatever those things that
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:32.560]   fructose oligo-saccharides um and so prebiotics
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:39.360]   you know give you gas so i'm not so big on those
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.760]   um as i am just about getting a decent fermented
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:49.040]   food or probiotics in okay so which do you prefer better a
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.520]   dairy based kefir or water based kefir?
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.360]   oh i will see i'm i'm partial to full fat
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.000]   dairy kefir and of course i make my own here with raw milk so
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.560]   you know absolutely the best full fat raw milk homemade kefir
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.680]   you can't beat that okay where did you where did you get your
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.840]   culture from like which culture do listen give me your address i'll send you
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.960]   some of my very own grains that you know
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:24.480]   yeah you know okay that is so cool you know because honestly i'm you know i
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.080]   as you know or everybody knows i or not everybody but i i was
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.600]   just moved to the midwest after living in Hawaii for 35 years
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.040]   and uh i got to tell you you know you think oh i'm in Hawaii you know
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.960]   it's really you it you cannot access raw milk
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.280]   it's just you just can't get it um and there's only one dairy on the big island
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.040]   and it's impossible and expensive so but i finally moved out here and i hooked
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.400]   up with an organic co-op and i can get anything i could ever dream of
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:59.200]   you know organic grass fed beef on the hoof i can get raw milk i can get any
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.760]   type of foul you know uh geese duck you know you
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.520]   and amnes you name it you can so yeah so now i finally have an
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.160]   access to raw milk and i've been wanting to
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.840]   uh you know wanting to kind of figure out what what to do with that
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.080]   so here's my favorite cleanse in the world it's the only kind of cleanse i've
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.000]   ever done it's a raw milk cleanse really
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.480]   all you drink all day long is raw milk and it is
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:32.560]   fabulous you're hungry as long as you can go the most i've gone is four days
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:38.160]   then i got a little hungry um but i just i felt so good i was
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.040]   never hungry i lost weight everything settled down
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.600]   i mean it was just like it was like magic oh that's
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.600]   oh thanks for that yeah yeah so it's something to think about
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.920]   yeah because you know on the topic yeah on the topic topic of detox you know
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.560]   that's that's let me just ask you this um i'm someone that
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.000]   every year uh at least every well every quarter
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.560]   um i will do the bob bec protocol just to cleanse myself out of pathogens
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.360]   it's uh one of the things that i do i just recently did a week of it and just
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.360]   kind of you know reset the bar um and then
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.200]   but from a detox standpoint what like what's your
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.240]   i mean obviously everybody has everybody should be doing something
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.360]   along the lines of detoxing on a daily basis right
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.960]   because i supplement i do take detox supplements
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.320]   but what's your like what's your recommendation for just
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.240]   in terms of there's people that are talking heavy toxic load and then you've
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.680]   got to so the detox advice would be different for them
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.040]   but for someone like myself who's been doing it daily
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.760]   you know i have all this regimen it's like what would you what would be your
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.440]   ideal um detox regimen for someone who's kind of like you know
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.080]   been into it for a while like what would you recommend
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:06.000]   on top of that raw milk idea so you've got that right you know doing
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.680]   seasonal detoxes is you know really important like in spring in the fall
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:17.920]   that's great i'm kind of um sold on the idea that detox
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:22.480]   should be done every single day um i mean you can do you know there's
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.680]   liver cleanses there's kidney cleanses uh usually what i will
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.480]   recommend for my people and this isn't an ongoing thing but if they need some
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.080]   kind of cleansing i will use a spagiaric
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:42.880]   um you do the pakana triads for the liver lymphatic and kidneys
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.680]   and that is like the best detox and drainage ever
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.440]   but what i but basically i use the full bacumic
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.200]   as a daily detox okay yeah me too that's you know
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.600]   that's just like you know that i know i can do for a long time
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.440]   and it's easy to do it's not expensive it doesn't
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.280]   hurt and it doesn't taste icky so it's kind of you know but if your
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.800]   thing is apple cider vinegar wow do that every day
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:15.600]   it's your thing is is lemon juice do lemon juice you know lemon juice and
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.800]   ginger and honey do that um so it's kind of like a personal
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.160]   thing like what what what are you drawn toward you know what works for you
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.320]   you know and then do that okay yeah because i've tried all sorts of
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.960]   different combinations i think lemon cayenne
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:38.320]   lemon um water with cayenne pepper was one of them that i felt a tremendous
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.600]   booth from i mean i think cayenne pepper is like the wonder
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.600]   wonder yeah that that spice is what i think
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.840]   when i finally fired my doctor years ago i was taking cayenne pepper
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:54.320]   to address the blood pressure you know might and and yeah it just dropped
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.160]   like a rock after taking cayenne pepper for a while
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:02.480]   okay wow such great advice and i know i've got your overtime and i'm just
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.800]   so many that's okay i don't care okay you know so um
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.120]   other questions so we've talked about probiotics and minerals and clays
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.560]   um i'm i'm wondering you know i've got this question here and it's a touchy
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:21.360]   subject you mentioned the whole thing about you know um the the poor girl
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:26.720]   who was who was suffering from the ravages of a modern vegan or vegetarian
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:32.960]   diet uh it's funny because while my daughter is uh it didn't have problems
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.760]   you know she what you know young person got onto that trend didn't
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.720]   she went vegetarian tried vegan that was too hard for went back to vegetarian
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.880]   and then you know but and i you know and this is after she left for college and
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.240]   then one day i was just like in her house and like
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.520]   yeah i'm like looking at the crap she eats and i'm like i can't believe
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.520]   you know she'd quote go to the health food store go back to the frozen section
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:03.920]   and get vegan orange chicken and vegan their vegetarian and i'm like i i was
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.280]   just looking at her like why are you eating this garbage it's
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:12.560]   it's quote health food but it's health food health garbage food you know
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.000]   it's just junk it's healthy to junk food for health you know people who think
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.520]   they're healthy and so i you know finally i just said
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.640]   you know i just lectured her i'm like don't eat this garbage it's all soy and
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.160]   and processed and and yeah you know it'd be just because the health food store
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.040]   sells it doesn't mean it's healthy um and you know what's amazing is like
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.080]   about a year ago she finally came to me and said dad you know i just
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.440]   i'm gonna go back to eating meat i you know i just don't feel well
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.120]   you know and then she's back on just regular eating meat
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.600]   um we just went and got a half a cow off you know beef on the hoof together
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.000]   stuffed our freezers and uh yeah she's doing great or she's you know
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.720]   she's mentioned that her cognitive she's sharper and
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.440]   has more energy but you know like what's your take on this whole thing about
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:05.040]   this fake ideology that being uh you know i guess you know it's just
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.640]   vegetarian vegans versus carnivore that's one thing
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.520]   but then the fake ideology of buying all that crap at the health food store and
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.320]   thinking you're eating healthy let's start with that one
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.840]   yeah so yeah what's your take on that great
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:24.480]   question so you're absolutely correct i mean
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.680]   the fake food it's highly processed and you know
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.920]   has many many chemicals and things that you don't want to be putting in your
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.240]   body um and what i see and i'm almost at the point
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:43.280]   where i almost have to tell people you know if you're not willing to change
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.840]   your diet then don't come and see me um vegans and vegetarians i find are
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:53.360]   very unhealthy um in general it kind of depends on how
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:59.040]   long they've been doing it um and i agree that you know
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:05.040]   having meat uh definitely adds to the health
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.760]   as i've seen you know the vegetarians that i see are
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:13.280]   generally highly inflamed and um
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.160]   cognitively are having trouble they just have a lot of trouble and so
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.200]   i will try to steer them onto you know more meats you know to do something
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:28.000]   you know more of a standard i'm a western price type
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.800]   person and i actually have a client who's uh going full carnivore so i'm
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:39.600]   looking at keto and carnivore right now so
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:47.920]   if i the the bottom line for them is i make them take liver pills
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.320]   if that's all that they can do then that will actually
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:56.960]   bump their health up but without meat um
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.280]   it's just very very hard to be truly healthy because the
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.560]   the protein you need the protein um the amino acids in it
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.920]   you know and i find that people who don't eat meat
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.760]   are really moody their moods really go up and down
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.520]   and they get very anxious because your body doesn't have enough protein
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.680]   to make the neurotransmitters and so
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.120]   and the whole the whole other side of the oxalate side of that
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.760]   which is plants are poison and they're trying to kill you
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.760]   every single plant every single fruit has a defense system
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.080]   to keep you from eating it that defense system
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:47.840]   are things like oxalates um it's not phthalates what's that
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:52.480]   phytic phytic acid um and salicylates they
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.240]   chelate minerals out of your body they keep you from
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.240]   absorbing your nutrients because that's their job
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.880]   so i i'm now to the point where i'm saying eat less vegetables eat less
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:10.320]   fruit um eat less grains eat more meat eat more fat
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:17.520]   eat more um dairy if you can um and moderate what water you're drinking
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.120]   you know that makes you know does that answer your question because i
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.800]   got yeah yeah it does because you know it's it's kind of like that whole thing
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:30.080]   about people think that uh if i bought it from the health food store
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.680]   it's good like you know like one day i was she was eating cereal
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.560]   and i'm like don't eat that garbage she goes like got it from you know i got it
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.000]   from Whole Foods and i'm like just because you bought it from Whole Foods
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   it's not healthy you know like Whole Foods is probably the one of the worst
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.920]   scourges i mean it's like are you kidding me or the whole foods and you go to
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.960]   their deli section you look at the crap that they're selling
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.880]   and it's like that you know but yeah that's just my thing about
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:00.560]   this fake i'm i'm living healthy thing when you're just stuffing yourself with
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.720]   soy and processed foods and processed foods it's all processed
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.880]   and then of course to your point you know this the eating all this plant-based
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.720]   stuff but you know that you know here you you know the argument right the
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:17.120]   vegetarians and vegans have about protein like you know
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.400]   because you look at these giant herbivores that are vegetarians
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:25.520]   um and they're just obviously massive you know animals and strong and all that
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:30.160]   um so what's your what's your comment on on on that rebuttal
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.960]   in terms of like well you know have you ever seen a rhinoceros or their
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:37.360]   vegetarians uh they're plant-based you know they got plenty of protein
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:41.680]   are you talking about animal herbivores yeah yeah you know like basically eating
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:46.320]   meat versus plants as a source of protein is it a different type of
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.680]   protein like what or is it or is the animal's physiology
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:54.400]   different so that because humans living off of plants is not the same thing as
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:00.560]   a rhinoceros eating living off of plants right in terms of physiology
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.520]   cows have seven stomachs yeah yeah that's their physiology
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:12.640]   is designed to turn that herb that grass that plant
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:19.280]   into nutrients for you oh look it's magic then you eat the meat and then you get
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:25.360]   the nutrients pre-digested for you because if you so the thing with eating
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.840]   you know all the plants especially raw stuff it takes you a long time to
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.960]   digest that and you have to eat massive amounts of
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:38.240]   food to get the amount of nutrients that you can get in a tiny little steak
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:43.840]   so really if you are really technical about it you should be eating like 27
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:50.800]   pounds of broccoli a day you know and 10 heads of celery and 10 pounds of
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.240]   carrots to get the same amount of nutrients that
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:01.920]   in animal protein and we are designed to eat that you know our teeth
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.960]   the digestive enzymes that we have our whole GI system we only have one
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.600]   stomach that we're designed to process that food
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.440]   so yeah that's a really good way of looking at it yeah you're absolutely
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.320]   right yeah because you know i've had like a recent
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.800]   run-in with a with a vegan and they brought up the whole rhinoceros thing
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.920]   then they brought up you know we argued about teeth
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.200]   and then we argued about the digestive tract
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.040]   you know when you look at like a canines direct digestive tract
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.520]   versus a humans and humans is so much longer you know given the size of our
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:42.000]   body thus forth you know we're not carnivores because you know
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.240]   but it's not about the digestive tract it's about the stomachs
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.960]   right and the physiology itself and the way the body metabolizes
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.600]   yeah how you would i mean cancer obligate carnivores
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.800]   i don't think they've got seven stomachs
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.320]   yeah but you know what they don't have the brains that we have either
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:08.880]   you know we're pretty complicated higher you know and when you look at
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.120]   civilization how it moved along you know having cooked
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.800]   me you know although i would argue maybe cooked meat isn't
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:22.640]   even as good as raw but you know really moved it forward
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.120]   so i think it really does provide a lot of nutrition
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:32.880]   in a compact amount that you can get with
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.960]   vegetables and grains and fruit and i and i know that's for the absolute
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:41.680]   opposite of what they're saying now yeah but yeah yeah absolutely i think
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.800]   the idea behind the oxalates and all that i think
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.080]   i think you know there's a huge push right now for people doing keto
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.680]   and carnivore kind of like the old Atkins day and i mean i mean
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.640]   Atkins was popular i did the Atkins diet and it made me feel so much better
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:30:01.280]   and that's actually when i gave up using oils for cooking and i just use
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.120]   lard and butter now um and so you know so i did want to kind of
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.640]   ask you about that too as well but just to wrap up the the vegetarian
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.200]   talk i think um what you know your record what would be your
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.560]   recommendation if someone was adamantly i need to be a
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.800]   vegetarian for whatever philosophical reasons i mean
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.080]   what would you tell them hey then you what would you have to supplement
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.200]   because i was making sure my daughter when she was vegetarian
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.800]   was at least taking b12 and i think i was giving her
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.240]   i think creatine or something else i was i forgot at the time but
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.120]   i was getting her supplements saying look you know whatever the research
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.600]   showed uh here at least take these supplements if you're
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.800]   gonna just eat nothing but you know process plant foods because
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.480]   here you know she was a vegetarian who hated eating salads
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.720]   so she would never eat a salad so she would just eat all this
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.080]   prosely we'd go out to dinner and she'd get a cheese pizza and i'm like oh
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.040]   man you know i actually know when i yeah she would get a
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.880]   vegetable she had the vegan pizza with the i think the worst product on the
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.480]   planet earth is vegan cheese never tried vegan cheese oh my god no
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:10.400]   because that is the most hideous it is it's awful oh my god don't it's like
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:14.080]   you want to hurt your someone give them vegan cheese
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.080]   but anyway it's okay so let's talk about oils uh
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.880]   and and i i wait to answer your question oh yeah
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.760]   liver pills liver pills okay liver pills have
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.360]   everything in it for you that's hands down the bottom thing that i would say
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:30.320]   you have to do this okay so so oils you just look up something called liver
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:34.000]   pills oh yeah liver beef it's liver it's just a
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.040]   liver pill okay so supplement called liver it's a liver it's always you're
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:40.480]   eating liver it's it's desiccated liver in a pill
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.200]   oh but you're never going to get a vegan to take a liver pill
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.440]   oh yeah absolutely mind it how would you get a vegan to take something that
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.680]   came from an animal yeah that's their that's the
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.560]   whole thing you know that's why i was like okay taking that's why i was like
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.760]   she wouldn't take anything at the at that point in her life and
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.960]   so i would just then you kind of have to throw up your hands and just say
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.360]   you're going to be you're not going to feel well until you
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:09.200]   change yeah yeah okay yeah okay but that's a good that's a good
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:15.120]   point though so if you have your your your your family members gone
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.880]   gone whole fields in that job this is how you can help them
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.680]   okay so let's talk about oils you know there's this huge
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:25.280]   deal in the health community right now i'm trying to warn everybody about
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.480]   seed oils right i hope everyone's listening to that
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.000]   so what's your what are your top three go-tos for
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.040]   what you cook with and what you eat you're a coconut oil person or
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:41.920]   olive oil nope my my go-to is duck fat
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.840]   and then it would be tallow or lard
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:54.080]   then butter i do like coconut oil but mmm it's always burns for me
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:59.040]   so i use that for some things i use some olive oil as
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.080]   long as it's sort of really really high quality
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:08.640]   yeah but basically any animal any tallow any
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:13.040]   you know lard all of that stuff as long as it's clean and doesn't have you
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:19.120]   know the processed bh tbh a in it but hands down duck fat is my favorite
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.880]   but i use you know what i use my own bacon grease i'll save it from the
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.800]   bacon i'll use that if i have roasted a chicken
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.520]   i'll save no and it's pure i'll save that fat and use it
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:36.560]   so yep anything any animal oil yeah that's good
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.480]   yeah it's kind of what yeah that's what um we do now is it's all butter or
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.160]   tallow um because as i you know as when we go and
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.720]   buy beef on the huff you know usually get like the
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:52.320]   five or ten pound bag you know of the fat and then we just render it down to
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:57.680]   tallow nice yeah and then replace that with lard if we run out but
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.280]   yeah absolutely that's that's definitely the way to stay healthy
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.040]   um okay so this has been fascinating i think i'm going to break this up into
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.960]   one and two part i think part two will be on supplementation
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.480]   and just so people can kind of narrow in on the subject because
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.840]   boy doesn't you know that that subject comes up so much about you know what
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:22.400]   supplements to take um okay so last question then uh for you is
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:27.680]   um what's your recommendation for um
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:32.880]   my daughter who is in grad school and isn't probably the most stressed out
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:37.200]   environment she's ever been in it's starting to be a doctor
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.520]   you probably under you probably can relate to that
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.440]   and so like and this is my thing right your kids you know how the kids are
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.280]   they never listened to you so like right before she started all this i'm
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.720]   like hey you know i made sure she had her supplements right i'm still being
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:56.080]   i'm still the dad and and she wasn't taking them and sure enough i you know i
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.280]   warned her about you've got all these different people flying in from all
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.160]   different places on the planet they're all bringing in every
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.280]   all of their illnesses that you have no immunity for
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.880]   you're in these tight spaces and labs and and lectures and
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.760]   you know with all these people that are from everywhere right because there's
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.640]   all these people there it's an international program
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:17.440]   and um i said you know what are you doing to avoid
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.560]   getting sick are you taking your supplements are you you know
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.640]   and so sure enough right she's literally a month and a half into the program
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.320]   sick as a dog caught something from somebody
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:32.080]   so like like i'm trying to figure out like what kind of a regiment regime
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.240]   can i put her on um to help her you know help her
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.840]   keep her immune system high while she's in this because
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.440]   we were just talking last night at dinner and she's like yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.800]   oh yeah yeah dad i know um and i'm like what are you taking
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.480]   you know are you taking are you taking and oh i ran out of that one i just said
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:54.160]   are you taking your d3k2 no i'm not taking it i'm like why are you not
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.480]   taking your d2 you know because she's not getting enough
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.640]   sunlight right because she's literally studying
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:04.240]   and in class and in labs and in clubs or whatever 14 16 hours a day so
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:08.320]   um so i like what do you recommend for someone like
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.400]   DEX just got sick last week i had her do the BEC protocol
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:16.640]   for three days kicked her get nailed her fever and now she's got this lingering
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.720]   thing um and so you know what would you do for
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:24.480]   someone in a high stress environment where they don't get any sunlight
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.800]   is there some kind of magic multivitamin that i could just say hey you know you
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.680]   know just take this one thing and um but you know what would you think of
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:39.200]   to help out someone like that so i'll tell you a couple things um
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.680]   my go-to is a really a really simple kind of
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:49.360]   pretty expensive inexpensive um supplement that i use for everything
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:53.600]   it's called wellness formula by source naturals
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.960]   it's just it's got everything in it and it will kick
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:02.000]   anything but um you at the beginning of when you
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.320]   start feeling bad you just start taking it every three or four hours
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.840]   and you know it's how i got out of my kidney stuff
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.800]   um so and there are like there's another one called bio-vegetarian by
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:18.320]   priority priority one um which is really really good
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.840]   they're just combos of a bunch of different herbs
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.560]   and some of the basic vitamins so that's one thing
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:31.680]   you know that i would keep on hand um the other thing that i do a lot
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.760]   is drink colloidal silver water
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.360]   that's an easy way to get things in your system
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:45.840]   that will kill pretty much anything um you know and if all she does is
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:52.240]   drink water and put you know a cup of colloidal silver in her jug for the day
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:55.440]   that would be amazing okay yeah because i've been making
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.280]   i've been making um mace and jar after mace and jar
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.600]   of colloidal silver for her yeah yeah i'll definitely look at this
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.320]   wellness formula and just try to get her to
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:10.240]   just take and add your colloidal silver to your water
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.840]   um the only thing she's doing right is she's getting decent sleep
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:17.440]   um but other than that she's been sick for two weeks and i'm mad at her
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.320]   so but the other the other thing that i would say
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:26.320]   having looked back on my medical school years i wish i had known at the
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.760]   beginning that i would have done the whole thing is i would have taken a
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.640]   adrenal glandular okay because the first thing that goes
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.200]   is your adrenals and if you can support those
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.400]   then everything else will kind of sort itself
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.400]   but you know the constant stress that's what shoots
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.520]   you know your adrenals in the foot so to speak
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:53.920]   and adrenal the glandular stuff that's the other thing that i really use a lot
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.160]   with people yeah you're making that in the group
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.120]   once okay yeah hands down that's probably one of the
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.200]   best things i'm taking a brain glandular right now that i really like
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:10.400]   i've used all whole body glandulars i i was on adrenal glandulars for months
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:15.120]   i use thyroid glandulars they really really support the body
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.880]   um you know no side effects of course it's a real basic foundational support
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:25.120]   it's not like using supplements it's like you're supporting the organ
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.560]   itself so um i think they're really amazing
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:35.520]   so the glandular is that a product line or is it just you go and research
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.040]   something just called phrase and adrenal glandular
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:44.160]   so there's it is quite a big thing right now there's lots of companies
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.040]   that will produce glandulars like biotics is one that i use
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:55.760]   um ancestral supplements has lots of really good ones
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:00.240]   and soil i think so you know there's there's just various
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:04.000]   ones um you know you just want to make sure that
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.600]   they're pure i like the ones anything from New Zealand is
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.120]   awesome okay
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:16.800]   so yeah does that help yeah thank you so much i just kind of want to put
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.840]   something together for her and just kind of help her out
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.280]   you know because she's my kid can you try to imagine
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:28.400]   um she you know i bought her all this stuff she doesn't use
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.440]   it has her own red light i mean she's got one of those expensive big
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.640]   door-sized red lights and i'm like are you using your light i mean
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.000]   because and she knows the thing that irritates me though is she knows
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.640]   everything she knows it all i've taught it to it
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.560]   and that but she just gets busy and you know it's frustrating right it is so
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.000]   pressure because like to me her this moment in her life
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.680]   these next four years are going to define her future
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.560]   and and you know it's like hey you got to be
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.440]   beyond the top of your game you got to take care of yourself
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:01.120]   kind of like that whole airline uh you know airline speech right you got to
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.800]   put the oxygen masks on yourself before you do the
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.320]   you know you got to you know take care of yourself because you cannot
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.080]   you cannot reach your dreams if you don't save yourself first but
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:16.720]   and then of course you know she she's trying her best i'm proud of her but
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.640]   ah that's awesome you know you said something and i got
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.280]   another follow-up question so i'm sorry about the
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.160]   i know this is really taking a long time but no no it's okay
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.360]   kidney stones you're saying that um you mentioned something was was really
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.440]   good for kidney stones i guess it was the wellness
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.720]   formula right uh was that yeah i have so kidney stones first of all i
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.200]   would look at oxalates in the diet because
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:46.800]   almost always oxalates will form into any kind of stone because they basically
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:53.280]   form shards and um grains in your body and
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.760]   gum everything up so that's the first thing i would look at the second thing
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.240]   um yep i've used the wellness formula along with
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:07.680]   the kidney drainage formulas um and i've had
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.200]   yeah i've given drainage formulas you know specific for kidneys
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:15.280]   and um we can drain the gut you can you can drain anything
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:20.080]   but also for blood vessels and i've had people say i think that that
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.520]   prevented people from having kidney stones and that
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.760]   lowered their blood pressure oh okay thanks for the tip
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.760]   yeah for me it's like um i hit that wonderful age that for you and young
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.960]   people who haven't reached that yet but you get into your 50s
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:40.240]   and boy it's so much fun uh and so i've i've had kidney stones three times now
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.720]   so but i haven't had one for years because i went and started taking
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:50.480]   um chonco piedra and i took the uh hydroxy citrate for a while
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.520]   but i continue to take chonco piedra twice a day
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:57.760]   uh you know bone breaker right herb and then um
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.120]   i actually took i don't know if you ever tried this and we haven't talked about
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:06.720]   peptide yet but i took the pile axe peptide for a year for kidney support
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:11.120]   along with hydroxy citrate and chonco piedra and that kind of stopped i mean
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:15.200]   i was on this pattern where i'd go um one year left one
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.480]   year later right side the year later left side i was you know it's kind of
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.680]   going back and forth and so then i started doing this regimen i just
[00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.480]   described and then it's i haven't had one since
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:28.240]   but i had one recently like with a few months ago but i passed it rule
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.840]   within a day and i'm kind of wondering like okay
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.280]   um you know so i don't know why it's coming back my diet's not the same anymore
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.880]   but i did drop off and i only take chonco and i was thinking maybe
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.080]   it's because i only take chonco not the other two things but
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.960]   i was looking into this this is my question um
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:50.960]   what do you think of castor oil packs to dissolve
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.400]   the kidney stone or you know to put it because i i actually tried doing that
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:58.960]   it was a real big mess because it's really hard to put the
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.080]   pack on your own back you know when you're single
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.520]   um but you know so but i finally figured out how to do it
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:09.200]   you know mat mechanically i don't get this thing on my back but what do you
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.000]   think of that i mean because i haven't found any research on
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.360]   that but it kind of seems intuitively based on all the research on castor oil
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.040]   that a pack might work for that one what's your thoughts
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:25.680]   yes absolutely you could hit on one of my other favorite therapies
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:30.880]   i always prescribe castor oil packs because they are freaking amazing
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.960]   and i haven't had anyone dissolve a kidney stone but i had
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.560]   a young woman come in she was in real good health
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:43.040]   really really good health but she had lowered kidney function
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:47.600]   and she was just freaking out about it so the only thing she did
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:53.120]   was castor oil packs she did them daily for weeks
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:58.880]   and she improved her kidney function like double double and triple
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:04.560]   and that was the only thing she did no supplements no herbs nothing
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.800]   wow so i know it works so what's the timing because what i was
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.320]   doing was what i was reading i got a heating pad castor oil pack with a
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:18.240]   heating pad 20 minutes each kidney is that kind of or is it too short
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.760]   what do you know i would do number one you don't actually need
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:26.080]   a heating pad you kind of want to because if you cover it with a glass
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:30.160]   yeah no no that's okay that's the standard if you cover it with plastic
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.440]   and a towel your own body heat will warm it up okay
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.800]   and that's actually some people actually say it's better to have
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:43.120]   pressure and to actually like use an ace bandage to pressure it to hold it
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.800]   tight against your body and that actually works better
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:51.360]   so you might try that but what i would do is i would do it longer
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:57.600]   like maybe 40 to 45 minutes and either alternate kidneys or just do
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:03.120]   both kidneys at the same time okay 45 minutes okay yeah so much for the
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:07.040]   freakin yeah no that's okay i'll send you a bill
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:10.880]   no problem just send me a bill uh and be more than happy to pay for this this
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:15.920]   has been so helpful awesome yeah that was what i was thinking
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.120]   sorry use the best castor oil you can find if
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:23.360]   no solvents and organic if you can right right i yeah yeah i wouldn't got it or
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.960]   i i always go for the organic non-gmo of everything it's like my
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.000]   rubber stamp for if it touches me it's non-gmo
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.200]   awesome good okay so i would definitely give that a try
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.160]   because i'm just trying to experiment i'm tinkering
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:40.480]   constantly i there's there's not a day goes by that i'm not tinkering with
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:45.040]   something um you know and trying to figure out another
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.800]   avenue towards health and healing but yeah so thank you so much for this
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:52.400]   time and it's just been a great chat i hope people

[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:33.280]   is just an amazing i think i would look at you as more like a
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.720]   a guide you know like a spiritual guide on that journey
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.000]   right that's how i look at it you know i'm the journey to

[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:59.200]   even in the allopathic world right the biggest problem with allopas
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:04.720]   other than their mindset is that at the studies that i've read
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:08.240]   literally i think it's more than half it's a really high number
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.240]   of patients don't even follow those directions
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.840]   that they'll never finish the full regimen of their antibiotics i'll never
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:19.040]   they just don't follow their directions and that's why they never
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:23.200]   as part of the reason they never get better they just don't take responsibility
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:28.000]   yep that's really true any any party and so
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.200]   so if people want to i guess i i'm sorry interrupted you

[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:47.520]   below for those of you who want to reach out to Nadine and thank you again
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:51.520]   this has been so fascinating and you know it's it's really rare
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:56.960]   i get a chance to kind of just like talk to someone like-minded because you
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.480]   know as as you might have noticed like i've been
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.160]   into this stuff for so long and it's great to kind of just
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:08.000]   bounce my idea off somebody who gets it better than me you know
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.200]   um and and as and a lot more knowledge about it because
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.960]   unlike yourself which is an accredited licensed professional
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:19.040]   i only went to university of youtube
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.320]   and so i'm a graduate of youtube university
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.680]   but you may or may not make it stand up for you
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:32.640]   actually k you are awesome because lay people who have done deep dives as you
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.200]   have and have the time to experiment and do
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.400]   think actually are full of lots of knowledge
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:42.880]   and it's just because i've gone to you know a medical school i'm full of
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:47.680]   medical knowledge but it's that specialized stuff that you've gone down
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:52.000]   the rabbit hole which informs you know all of us
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.200]   so you have just as much value um you know as i do and and we all do
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.760]   so i really appreciate you and i thank you for this opportunity
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.920]   oh awesome thank you thank you for that yeah i mean i'm like i'm right now i'm
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.920]   doing uh i i really enjoy the whole biohacking because to me
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:13.040]   there's health and healing right which is all the stuff you and i have just
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.080]   chatted about but then there's this whole biohacking space
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.280]   and i and i really love to play in both spaces so
[00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:24.240]   i'm into the whole like you know red light therapy and you know uv lamps and
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:28.640]   and you know gases i'm really into the whole gases thing hydrogen browns gas
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:32.320]   i'm doing a video right now on on ozone and and just
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:36.080]   just you know all the there's so many other ways to to approach all of this
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:39.200]   but it really kind of to me the whole biohacking thing is
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:43.600]   kind of like the a lot of fun you know you're like what can i actually do
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:47.760]   to improve performance but you have to start off with that foundation though
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.600]   of health and of health you got to be able to heal yourself and then
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:55.920]   once you can get that organized uh then start biohacking for even
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:52:01.760]   better performance right so forth so yeah tweaking your brain is another
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:05.440]   right to talk about but anyway i'm just like thank you
