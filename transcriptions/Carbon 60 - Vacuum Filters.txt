[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me K Elmer and in
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.100]   this video I would like to share with you what I wish I knew before I ever
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.240]   started making C60 oil about vacuum filters and you might think that it's
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.600]   kind of a simple thing but it's actually way more complicated than I ever realized
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.520]   and it's taken me this long to figure it all out and decide you know what I
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.480]   like the best. So I learned a lot and I wanted to share what I learned with you.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.640]   First off though that we got to do the disclosures. This material is for
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.560]   research purposes only. C60 oil is not approved for consumption by the FDA. You
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.760]   understand that making and consuming C60 oil is experimental and you do so at
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.480]   your own risk. I do not endorse any products, I do not have a stake in any C60
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.760]   company or product. I do not get paid in any way to make videos. This material is
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.840]   purely my own research that I willingly share with others. All right let's jump
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.200]   in. Now it's basically very simple. If you're making your own C60 oil it's four
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.960]   steps. It's you add the C60 to whatever oil of your choice. You stir for a couple
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.000]   of weeks and you let it settle for 10 days or a couple of weeks. You can change
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.400]   up the duration of these two steps any which way you like. You don't want to
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.680]   skimp on settling though so you can go longer. That's my tip there and you'll
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.040]   have you know you'll have C60 oil. Now the last step is filtering. So now why
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.300]   would you filter? That's you know obviously a really good question. Well
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.600]   here's the deal. If you don't filter it okay you are going to ingest either this
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.360]   this is this here's an example of this picture here. This is a picture of
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.720]   filtering C60 oil after the two weeks without letting it settle. So here you
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.880]   got all of this residual C60 and whatever else is going to be in there
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.820]   stuck in the filter. Now if you don't filter that you are the filter and that's
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.360]   going to go in your body. Now the next thing is if you do let it sit for 10
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.440]   days this is what the filter looks like. So you can see that settling gets rid of
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.880]   you know basically you save the residual C60 and you don't get it caught in the
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.740]   filter but if you let it sit and you still filter it you will still come out
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.280]   with this brown stuff. And you know this brown stuff is most likely in a lot of
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.740]   people speculate. Clearly it's residual C60. It's the very fine
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.440]   particulates of C60 whatever impurities that the C60 pulled out of the oil and
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.160]   it's this brown stuff and it always is it's always there. Okay so here's my
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.740]   point. If you don't filter and it's your prerogative because you know you're
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.760]   taking this stuff. The bottom line is that your body your filter your filter
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.640]   your kidneys will have to filter this for you and for some of you maybe it's
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.720]   not a problem. For someone like me where I actually have kidney stones in my
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.440]   body when this stuff gets you know it's kind of think of it like this it's like
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.740]   river rocks and all of a sudden you throw a bunch of pebbles into the river
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.720]   rocks and the water still has to pass through. Those little pebbles are gonna
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.340]   fill in all the gaps between the river rocks and it's gonna clog you up like a
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.580]   beaver dam. Okay and that's what happens to me and it causes me a lot of pain if
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.860]   if I drink anything that doesn't hasn't been filtered yet. I mean the C60 oil
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.540]   and so that's why I steadfastly filter because I have kidney stones and I've
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.300]   had them in the past obviously. Now for those of you who don't have any issues
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.640]   with kidney stones it's your call but I'm just letting you know if that's your
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.080]   issue then you definitely need to filter or you will you will feel it okay
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.580]   and that's why I filter. So anyways let's jump right in here. Now these are the
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.280]   types of vacuum filters. You've got two basic types you've got the single use
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.120]   plastic ones that use a PES membrane and I'm not even gonna try to pronounce
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.600]   this and that's the type of membrane that they use right in this little line
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.640]   right there and this middle part of this bottom of the funnel is a membrane and
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.240]   that is what they're using as the filter. This is the funnel this is the
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.200]   reservoir bottle and basically that's it's a plastic one-time use and it's
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.200]   it's kind of unfortunate that people or some people don't realize that at first
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.600]   you know and it is not very clear that's why I'm doing this video because I
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.280]   didn't you know I mean I didn't really know either I bought one of these in the
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.320]   very, very beginning and I tried to clean the thing and it just didn't clean and
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.640]   couldn't figure out why until I did more research but you know it's kind of
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.000]   sad though because people are commenting on Amazon that these things aren't that
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.100]   great because they couldn't clean them and it's like well you're not supposed
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.360]   to clean them you cannot clean them and when you're done with it you throw the
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.320]   top part away and keep the bottle you know so they're single use and that's
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.320]   the first thing you should know about these plastic guys. Oh and they also
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.520]   break if you have a too strong a vacuum pump which I learn the hard way. Now the
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.240]   other kind of vacuum filter are these multi-use ones are made out of Pyrex or
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.680]   made out of borsilic glass they're really sturdy they can take a lot of
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.680]   heat they can take a lot of cold they're really solid type of glass and they're
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.800]   used they're they come in two different ways they either have a sinker disk or
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.080]   poor plate and I'll let you explain what that is but this is what they look like
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.240]   so you can get a glass one or you can get plastic one so you throw the tops away
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.480]   on this one and buy a new one or you can just use these over and over and over
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.720]   with with filter paper. Now instead of having the membrane or the filter
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.160]   right here that comes with the filter you have to buy a filter paper that you
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.240]   put at the bottom of these funnels all right. So let's go through the actual
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.360]   parts of these things and and believe me that you don't think about this
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.200]   stuff until you start having to use them all. So now here again I'm just gonna
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.840]   go over it one more time this is the simplest model okay it is so simple it's
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.960]   only two parts it's the top part which is the funnel and it's the bottom part
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.920]   which is the glass flask okay and that's it at the bottom of the funnel is a
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.960]   permanent filter plate and it can come in either just a glass with holes in it or
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.320]   it can come as a like basically when they say coarse cinctered glass it's
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.760]   basically crushed up glass compressed like particle board right and it's it's
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.800]   just it's just it's kind of glued into the bottom of this thing and that's it
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.680]   you've got just the two pieces. One thing that's real important about buying
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.640]   these things is is if you're buying the top separate from the bottom you want to
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.120]   make sure that you get the right joint size and that's the 24/40 so you see
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.240]   that number right there you'll see it in the advertisements make sure because
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.000]   that's you're gonna know if this thing's gonna fit into this you gotta get the
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.160]   appropriate joint size all right and then of course there's this little part
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.560]   right here which is for the vacuum hose and it's the two pieces. Now this other
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.760]   guy right here which is you know what's really hard about this is all the
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.640]   people that sell these things call these two things the same thing they call them
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.160]   glass butchner vacuum filters right and so you don't know really which one
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.160]   they're talking about unless you really look at the picture. Now this guy right
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.280]   here is way more complicated it comes in four parts there's the top part right
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.960]   here which is the glass funnel that's a separate piece of glass then this little
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.400]   mid piece glass called the glass support base and in between the funnel and the
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.800]   support base is the filter plate that you put the paper between and then you
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.960]   would use this clamp to hold the top and the bottom together okay so there's
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.000]   four parts right there's three parts right there and the fourth part right
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.600]   down here is the glass flash so these three things connect with the clamp and
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   then you stick it on top of this flask and so the difference between these two
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.000]   really is that this funnel fits inside the flask this funnel when all when
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.160]   assembled fits over the flask it's semantics and that's really what the
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.920]   different pieces are so and then of course you've got your vacuum nozzle as
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.760]   well this will all come in really makes it'll make more sense why going over the
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.160]   parts here now the thing about the filter plates okay so you've got two
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.420]   different models right you got one that clamps together and you put the
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.200]   filter in between and then you get one that just has it stuck in you know it's
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.460]   it's permanently in the funnel all right now the thing about the filter plates
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:03.760]   that you put the filter on top of okay so this one you put the filter on top of
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.480]   this guy this when you put it in the between the two pieces here now the thing
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.640]   about this filter plates when you're looking at models like this is you can
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.260]   buy them either a cinctard which is the glass like the compressed glass or you
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.740]   can buy them as poor plates I just wanted to show you the picture so you can see
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.120]   that there's a difference between the two so when you see the word poor plate
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.320]   it's it's just glass with holes in it and you see the word cincter it means
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.040]   compressed glass you know crushed glass and that's the two differences and you'll
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.280]   see in a demo here at the end what the difference is when you use those okay
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:43.000]   now the thing about the course now and the course comes in two different ways
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.080]   as well you can get this can come in course and this always comes in course
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.220]   okay so right in here there's like a little course filter plate on top of the
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.460]   glass support base I know it gets a little crazy but anyway this is what it
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.820]   looks like okay if you take that top part off you get this bottom part and
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.420]   that thing fits over the flask okay well right in the middle is that compressed
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.420]   glass the what they call a course filter and in this guy here that just fits on
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.240]   top that's a course filter as well so you've got this environment where you
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.020]   know they use the same words for a lot of different things so that's why it was
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.280]   it's so so confusing in the beginning for me because you know you'd read
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.540]   something and it'd say the exact same words two times but there were two
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.520]   different things so it's it's kind of nutty and so when you're buying course
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:33.480]   filters the thing to know is that the you know it's it's basically meant to be
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.920]   porous right so they crush the glass and compress it but they want to compress
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.260]   it at a certain PSI and the more you compress it the tighter the holes get
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.900]   between the glass and so you've got these different sizes the one all the way
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.500]   through six and then it basically translates to this table it seems that
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.640]   when all the ones I've you know I've just I didn't know any of this too I just
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.420]   started I just bought one and it just happened to be 15 to 40 micron and really
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.140]   what that means is you're gonna put a piece of filter paper on top of this guy
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.180]   right and then whatever the filter doesn't catch it's gonna get caught in
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.880]   here and so it's kind of acts as a double filter but you could if you
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.280]   really really really really wanted to make sure that nothing like if you're
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.320]   dealing with viruses and things like that in the lab you're gonna want to make
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.100]   sure that nothing gets through so you're gonna have like the paper and you're
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.520]   gonna want that course filter right in here to be the same size that you would
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:30.040]   want to use right but for the purposes of making C 60 oil the idea about C 60s
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.160]   you want to get at less than 0.2 micron you know the paper and then using the
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.020]   course filter you know there's obviously you'd really kind of technically want
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.340]   to get it get it down this low but it seems like these are the only ones the
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.820]   most common ones you can buy so this is what I use and it works just fine and I'll
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.140]   show you what it looks like you know stuff does get by the filter and get
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:56.040]   stuck in this course filter okay the filter paper and then it will get stuck
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.420]   in into this let's just call it a filter stone or something but the idea
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.540]   though is that it goes through paper and then it goes through this and then it
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:08.100]   goes into the flask and this acts as a second filter so if you really want to
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:15.660]   get into it you can buy a very very very coarse filter to go with your
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:20.520]   vacuum filter okay see I'll get it it gets confusing alright hopefully I
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.120]   haven't been confusing now when you're looking at the types of filter paper that
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.280]   you want to use always remember the diameter of your funnel okay so you've
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.640]   got the funnel right here and this thing has a particular diameter all of mine
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.580]   have a 70 millimeter they can be bigger they can be smaller and so when you buy
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:43.760]   the paper it needs to fit and so the first thing you want to make sure is that
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:49.000]   it's the right diameter because I have screwed up and bought the wrong size now
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.280]   also to if you're using powdered C60 you only need to filter it once after you
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.360]   let it settle and it's recommended at the point two two now that's based off the
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.980]   rat study and the UM means micron so 0.22 microns we're going off of what they
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:08.960]   use in the rat study and the type of filter now I'm they got a guide a filter
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.160]   guide of all the different materials that filters are made out of paper
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.520]   filters in the link below in the link in the video description okay if you want
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.980]   to read up about them but if you read the original rat study the type of
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:26.520]   filter they use with a cellulose acetate okay so so basically everybody sticks
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:33.280]   with the rat study formula they just use a 0.22 micron cellulose acetate filter
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.640]   that they put in their vacuum filter see how this works use the word filter like
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:43.440]   3000 times for different things anyway so if using pulver I see 60 the
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:51.080]   recommendation from red line is that you filter it first with a 20 micron filter
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.800]   usually it's cellulose paper rate and then a 10 and then over the time that I've
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:02.040]   been doing it I've discovered that when I use pulverized I just skip the 20 I just
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:07.720]   use a 10 micron filter and then I filter again with 0.22 so that's kind of how I
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.120]   do it with pulverized but if you just follow the the pure instructions right
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.000]   off the website then you just use a 10 micron and this is what it looks like
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.320]   just little disks of paper okay now the next thing you need to know is the tubing
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:26.240]   now tubing connections they vary by filter so if you when you look at whoop
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.160]   when you look at these different funnels right they've got like this little
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:37.200]   vacuum nozzles they vary in size and so I took a look at all three and they
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.720]   measured from 8 millimeters to 15 millimeters so what happens is that if
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:47.160]   you guys have a filter 8 vacuum pump that you can get off Amazon the hose
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:52.040]   adapter will fit most vacuum filters that's what this hose adapter is for the
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:59.200]   filter 8 but now most recently Swift started selling now they ship with the
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:03.640]   with their new models they ship the filters with a filter adapter on the
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.400]   hose the very first ones that I bought did not have a filter adapter which is
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:13.080]   just a basically a rubber hose attached to the tubing okay and so now the swift
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:19.440]   hose that comes with the with the pump today does not is not going to fit the
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.880]   the filters okay the nozzles and this is the difference here this is the
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:28.360]   filter 8 and that's the swift tubing and there is no way I try there's no way
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.400]   you can get this this adapter to fit on any of the glass ones so if you just
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:38.440]   have a swift and yours and you got this tube you can't use the glass ones okay
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.640]   so the reason I can is because I originally bought a filter 8 which came
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.920]   with this tube and I and then of course the filter 8 after about a year kind of
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.880]   just pitters out and then I bought a swift so I actually used my filter 8
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.720]   hose with my swift pump and it works perfectly but you need this bigger you
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.920]   see how much bigger it is you need this guide in order to fit onto the onto the
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.600]   onto the nozzle of the filter and then lastly you know just as I when using a
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:10.840]   stronger pump stronger than filter 8 or swift which is these two little pumps
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:16.080]   are less than one cubic feet per minute but if you use anything greater than
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.280]   that then I highly recommend that you use tubing with a minimum of five
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.080]   millimeter thickness and the reason is if it's not thick enough it's going to
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.000]   collapse in on itself and you won't be able to get a good vacuum on on the
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.600]   flask okay so you want to get something that's pretty thick and what I use for
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:40.240]   this is I actually use aquarium filter the filter for aquariums it comes with
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.360]   this this really thick hose that thing works perfectly and so I use that and
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.920]   that works great now from a standpoint of costs this is what is going to cost
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:56.280]   you to filter your C60 and and the idea here is the different ways you could do
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.480]   it so just as just off the top if you're going to buy a single use that's going
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.520]   to cost you about 1092 if you buy 12 it you know if you buy a case at a time now
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:12.480]   that ones that have the clamp are $49.99 the ones that are just the the regular
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:17.200]   suction filter that doesn't have the clamp is $38.13 the one that's got the
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.640]   glass pore plate $42.86 and then the filters themselves now they're 0.22 the
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:28.840]   smaller the porosity of the filter paper that more it costs and so I get them
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.680]   right now for $21.99 you get 50 at a time and if you're getting the 10 milli
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.560]   10 micron filters right now I can't find any on Amazon you can only find the
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.480]   11 micron filters it's cellulose which means it's paper you get a hundred at a
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.320]   time for $13.48 so these are the various costs that you're going to have to
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.480]   incur to put together your filter device if you choose to filter the other thing
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.200]   too is obviously you're going to need a pump I did a separate video on pumps so
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.880]   you can go watch that video about the different kinds of pumps and kind of give
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.120]   you an idea how they work and stuff but like I said I use the I use the tubing
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.960]   that comes with the filter rate vacuum pump so if you don't have a pump just
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.320]   buy the filter rates you'll have the tube and you'll have the pump and that
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.360]   comes for $39.99 so overall you know you can make a combination of these types
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.960]   of these different things so that you can have a filter rig and the price range
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.480]   is going to be about a hundred bucks to 120 bucks okay and that 120 bucks is if
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:27.000]   you decide to go with a much stronger pump and better hoses and so as you know
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.680]   from the video from the video I made about pumps I use a cozy vacuum at 3.5
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:38.800]   cubic feet for a minute and it cost me $58.99 so the ideal you know like the
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:45.600]   most you'd spend is 121 bucks to have like this really fast strong pump glass
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:50.920]   you know filter or you could just go and get the the least expensive one for
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:57.720]   100 so the delta between the cheaper versus the better is so low that you
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.400]   know it's something to think about that it's it's it's so you know it's not a
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.760]   lot of difference between getting the best you can get versus just going you
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.200]   know good enough all right so that's something important about the price now
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.560]   let's talk about which is better and so when you talk about which is better I
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:17.200]   look at it from a standpoint of quality of output how fast that thing works how
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.440]   easy is it to clean and can I get the replacement parts for it so why don't we
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:27.640]   just take a look at my this little video I created about you know this was my
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.200]   demo and what I initially thought I was going to do was I got all three I got
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:38.040]   brand new funnels for my my glass sink dirt one this is what I'd been using
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.920]   for over a year now I've been using this model here and so I got a brand new one
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.600]   for the test and I'd hoped that you know I bought some extra swift pumps and I
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.400]   thought it'd be a really great idea you know to hook up a swift pump to all
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   three of these guys and then do this you know like a race right but then two
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.880]   things happen one there there's no way I could get the the tube on a swift pump
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.400]   the tube that comes with this guy to fit onto the nozzles that was my first
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.800]   lesson learned and the second lesson learned was one of these two didn't even
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.600]   work so I bought three swifts now and only two of them have worked I'm sending
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.120]   the other one back for a refund so that nicks that idea so instead what I had to
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.440]   do was do a combination of using a swift pump with a you know with that
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.600]   filter hate tube and I connected it to one of them and then I had to pull out
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.400]   my cozy vacuum and I use that with the other one so I didn't get the run the
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.920]   race to see which one was faster but I do have anecdotal you know observations
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:39.280]   that that indicate that you know which one was faster and which one slower so now
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:46.680]   this was my the three I bought and so right here you can see right here is the
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:54.480]   course filter inside the glass base for this type of filter and then right here
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.440]   is the one I've been using for a while and this is what I used to call the stone
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.840]   but it's basically the sinctered filter that's in that it's funnel and then that
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:06.960]   one right there is the poor the glass pour plate and this is just it's just a
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.520]   plate of glass with holes drilled in it okay and that's how that filter works
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:16.640]   okay so I got all three I took the I took identical I just had to happen I've
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:22.360]   been working on this other experiment and so I have some C60 oil that has been
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.800]   setting for about two weeks so what I did was I filled up each one of these
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:32.040]   with approximately 300 milliliters and then because I'd used pulver I C60 I had
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.960]   to run them twice I first ran them through an 11 micron filter paper I put
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.520]   a paper here I put a paper on top of that put a paper on top of that and so I
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:47.320]   ran them through the 11 once and then I redid it again at 0.22 and you'll see
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.960]   kind of the experiment oh and this right here now that's the one that I've been
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.400]   using for a year and this is what happens and you can see you know earlier
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.280]   you can know that this was pure white and then this is what happens over a
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.480]   year and what this implies clearly is that even if you have paper on top of
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.120]   this thing the paper filter that you know you're still gonna get C60 that's
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.920]   gonna seep into your into your cincter the glass and so over time it's just
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.720]   gonna turn black brown and then I'm sure it's gonna turn black and it's just
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.400]   gonna get so thick that it just won't work one day but after one year that's
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.160]   what it's gonna look like and this is kind of this other one here that I've
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.480]   got this is one that I used in the vacuum pump video and what was real
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.640]   interesting about that is I put paper in here but you can see by the pattern of
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.840]   accumulation that you can see with that the the oil went around the paper and
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:43.320]   just this whole ring ended up being the filter you know and so the so this one
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:48.240]   every one of them you buy by the way is a little different so this one you know
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.280]   it just it was it just it didn't I don't for whatever reason it just didn't it
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.200]   didn't wasn't able to seal around the edges and so the edges took in a lot of
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.560]   the C60 oil and act acted as the filter itself okay that was my other one not
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.080]   just from that one use so now this is what I was using for pumps this is the
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.680]   Swift pump I've got my filter 8 tubing you know that from the other video and
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:16.080]   it fits just well now this is the thing that you this is the adapter when you're
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.040]   using the plastic ones and so this fits just as well on the plastic one and the
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:25.080]   point that I want to make about tubing is that it's it's impossible to put it
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.520]   on if you don't have that little black adapter so now what happens now is swift
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.440]   now sells pumps they sell tubing with this and as you can see that the size is
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.760]   just and totally different and so there's no way you can get this little guy
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.400]   that's that comes with the swift on these hoses so this is when I pulled out my
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:45.280]   cozy vacuum which is another vacuum pump a much bigger one a much stronger one
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.320]   and I started connecting him up so I've got basically if you can see in the
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:52.720]   background I've got a swift pump plugged up into this guy pulling it through and
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:58.120]   I've got my cozy vacuum plugged into this guy and I'm pulling it through and I'm
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:03.200]   filtering all of the oil this right here is at the 11 micron paper filter stage
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:08.040]   and so everything is starting to come through now when I was finished doing one
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:13.200]   full run of 11 micron and remember now the reason I'm doing it twice is because
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.360]   I'm using pulverized C60 you have to filter it twice if you want to get a
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:22.400]   really high quality product okay if you're just using powdered C60 just running
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.760]   it once should be fine okay so now at the end of the of the of the run and I
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.320]   used all three of the different filters this is how it came out
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.920]   basically first of all this is the poor plate now you can see the poor
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.040]   plate is perfectly clean because it's just plain glass and this is what this
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:48.080]   was the quality of the end product after filtering it through 11 and 0.22 now
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.400]   this other one you can see it's kind of a if you see it through the light I
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.200]   didn't pick it up but if you see through light it's kind of a dusty dusty rose
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.680]   does you know dusty purple color and so then this other one here this is the
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:05.160]   cinctered glass filter and this one also produced the same level of quality in
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.360]   terms it was kind of like this you know like kind of a muddy purple I guess
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.880]   muddies probably the better word and so this was the muddy purple and then this
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.160]   guy here you can see it's no longer pure white but it's also not brown so that
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.920]   this time this particular filter right there happen to really hold the filter
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.800]   paper quite well and not as much got around it okay now this guy right here
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:31.120]   is the one that you clamp on and one of the things I wanted to show is that this
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:37.480]   also the you know this was white before and then this also basically you know
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:43.400]   had c60 seeping through the 2-2 paper or at the point 2-2 paper and into this
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.840]   coarse thing so this is not immune either to absorbing some of the c60 and then
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.760]   it also then needs to be cleaned out to make sure that this doesn't get stuck
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:58.440]   in the course the cinctered right the glass cincter anyway and so but here's
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:04.440]   the thing look at that what's really interesting was the quality of the
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.680]   output the final product was so much better I mean this is is is is perfect
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:14.680]   this is a dark rich purple the darker the color you know the more c60s in that
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:20.520]   purple because you got to realize this is 80% MCT and 20% coconut oil when I
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:25.200]   started this was perfectly clear so to end up with a dark purple means I've got
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:30.440]   a very high saturation rate of c60 in the oil and it's it's essentially
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.960]   pristine c60 oil at that point but then these two guys you know they're purple
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.000]   if you show it shine the light but I'm just they're just kind of muddy and so
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.560]   there you go from an output standpoint there's a huge difference
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:47.480]   between those three filters now this is the filter paper well when I ran it
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.560]   through the 11 micron filter this is the glass cincter this is the poor plate
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.520]   obviously and then this is the clamp model and so you can see that there's
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.160]   really you know when you look at the filters the only thing that's kind of
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:03.040]   funky is this guy doesn't look as dark as these two so the poor plate didn't
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:09.040]   seem you know 10 11 micron paper didn't seem to pick up as much because if
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.160]   there's this much in the oil because remember this all came from the same
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.040]   batch and this is all that that filter held and you can tell you know there's
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.840]   a clear reason why it's so muddy but what's really weird is that even though
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.360]   this picked up so much more it's still muddy and then this guy you know they
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.920]   all actually at this stage at 11 they all came out muddy but this one was by
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.760]   far the most muddy and when I did it the second time with 0.22 micron we'll
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:39.760]   take a look at those filters you'll see that at this stage you can see where the
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.620]   poor plate really picks it up because this is a much thinner porosity filter
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:48.320]   paper and so you can see it took out a lot of impurities and a lot of residual
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.680]   particulates and so it really did do a good a much better job and this one of
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.720]   course is like literally a solid thing I mean this was the cinctered glass the
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.160]   one in the middle and this clearly it just filtered out everything and then
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:05.960]   this guy right here was the the clamp and it as well as this one you can tell
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:11.600]   it's so jet brown you know that it did take out a lot of the impurities but you
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.440]   know the proofs in the pudding when you actually look at the color of the oil
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.920]   and so let's just go back here when I look at the color when you compare that
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:26.920]   color to those colors there's just its hands down that this one well not that
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:33.680]   one but this guy right here collected and filtered out the most amount of
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:38.440]   impurities of the you know compared to the other two so clearly you know it is
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:44.440]   it is definitely a much higher quality of output you know when you use the one
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:50.560]   with the clamp now when it comes to speed the the poor plate was the fastest by
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.920]   far that thing just zipped right through it because for obvious reasons you can
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.720]   just imagine why you know that would work so much faster but then in but
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:04.360]   overall I found that you know the the poor plate and the cinctered one those
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.640]   two which you know really really were were much faster were twice as fast as
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:13.000]   the one with the clamp because you can imagine the clamps got a much smaller
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.760]   aperture right and and then it's because of the way it's designed nothing is
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.280]   going to get around it or not as much is going to get around it so the speed
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:26.940]   was was quite remarkable the clamp was two to three times slower than the other
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:32.720]   two the clamp was okay now in terms of cleaning I think what's really important
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.160]   about the cleaning is you know that's that's that's got to be something you
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:40.720]   have to consider and so easily the poor plate wins that one it's so much
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.920]   easier to clean and I'm going to tell you the other two are hard but you know
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.240]   you just run some hot soapy water through that with the vacuum on and you
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.920]   should be able to be okay but clearly you know cleaning that thing is going
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:56.000]   to be is is not it's it takes some effort okay the course wins and then in
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.800]   terms of replacement parts you know the thing about replacement parts when you
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.840]   look at these three I went looking for replacement parts and so now these little
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:11.240]   glass flasks right here these two guys they cost about 13 bucks on eBay and then
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:16.120]   you look at these two filters the funnels this guy costs about and about 30
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.920]   something dollars and this one costs like 28 dollars and so they're not that
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.560]   expensive once you own these guys and this guy will never get plugged up so
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:27.200]   this is like a permanent filter you'll never have to do anything else this guy
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.360]   and this guy because of that cinctered filter plate right there it's gonna get
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.880]   plugged up one day and you're gonna need to replace it and so I buy the you know
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.360]   actually like you saw I have three of them and they're like 23 bucks each so
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.880]   you can just buy another one if this gets you know full and you're good to go
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.640]   and these flasks probably will last forever unless you drop one this guy the
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:52.480]   clamp one I looked all over and there are no replacement parts and I'm sure I
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.960]   didn't find it and there are but I couldn't find them and I gave it a good
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.600]   you know 15 minutes of hardcore searching and I'm good at searching so you
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:06.080]   know I if in with a lack of easily to find replacement parts meaning when this
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:11.720]   cinctered plate gets so cluttered or so clogged that you got to replace it
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:15.080]   you're gonna have to buy the whole rig and the whole rig is gonna be it's
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:20.840]   gonna be a little bit pricier so you know in conclusion when you look at the
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:26.280]   quality of the output and you look at having to replace the speed and so forth
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:31.400]   and how easy it is to clean you know I'm kind of I'm on the fence but I'm I am
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:36.520]   heavily leaning towards the fact that I really like this model because up till
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.640]   now this is what I have been doing I've been using the cinctered glass filter
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:45.800]   plate on a funnel and so I paid for like 38 bucks for this thing and then and
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.560]   then but you saw it comes out cloudy right it comes out muddy and so then I
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:54.320]   would just run it through here like with a 10 or 22 and then depending on the
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.960]   type of C60 and then I would toss it in one of these and I'd run it at 0.22 and
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.680]   it come out that beautiful purple and so every time I run a batch you know I
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.800]   bought this thing it's a kind of a permanent thing but I have to use papers
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.680]   here right so I'm I'm always burning up money to using papers which you will
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.120]   on this one right but pretty much I paid for that thing and it's running but I
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.720]   had to keep buying one of these I buy well a case at a time but I burn one of
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.800]   these every time I run a batch so over time it's gonna be very expensive right
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:26.720]   because it's 11 bucks a batch but this guy I'm figuring that for 49 or 49 bucks
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.040]   right I can buy this thing and all I gotta do is put in papers like I would
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:34.320]   over here but it's gonna probably last a good long time as long as I keep it
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.640]   really clean and overall it's gonna be the cheaper alternative cheaper and
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.960]   better quality and so I am so impressed with the output from this guy that you
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.680]   know from now on this is gonna be my go-to once I burn up all of these now
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.480]   lastly I want to just kind of tell you because right now these the I took the
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:56.920]   muddy the muddy output from the other two funnels and I poured it into this
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.560]   clamp one and I hooked it up to the swift so while I'm making this video this
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.400]   thing's running and I just ran over and took a quick picture of it and look at
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:08.040]   how beautiful the purple is so you know it's it's I proved it you know those
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.680]   other two filters they're not as good from an output standpoint and so it this
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.320]   one is clearly the better filter using the same paper now it's the better
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.160]   filter so this is really my recommendation if you're looking for a
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:25.360]   filter and you haven't bought one yet then this is the way to go and you will
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:29.400]   literally have the highest quality output you can get without having to
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.280]   kind of like keep burning these now these these these these plastic ones
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.240]   because these plastic ones are they're really good I mean they work really
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.560]   well you get that beautiful purple every time but if you can get that beautiful
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:43.760]   purple with this guy you're good to go well that's it thank you so much for
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.240]   watching this video I know it's kind of this you know nerdy kind of topic but
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.160]   you know thank you thank you for you know stopping by and and listening to me
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.800]   ramble about vacuum filters I hope I didn't ramble too badly and I do
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.520]   appreciate all your kind comments from my last video it was very very very
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:07.720]   touching I did find something new about that as well and basically you know C6
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.080]   he's really good for a lot of different things but C60 will not mend a broken
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:17.920]   heart so anyway that is something that we all learn so thank you again for
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:23.240]   stopping by and and spending some time with me and watching my video if you have
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.920]   any questions again there's we have a telegram C60 chat group for people who
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.960]   like to make C60 so if you have any questions that you're trying to do your
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.000]   own project just jump on in and there'll be a whole bunch of people be really
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.880]   happy to answer your questions alrighty so thanks again have a great day aloha
