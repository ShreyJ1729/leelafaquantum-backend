[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   Hello and welcome to another carbon 60 video by me, Kay Elmer and today's
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.100]   video is a little different because I'd like to share with you my take on what
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.920]   are the health benefits of C60 and where you can buy C60 and how much you
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.000]   should take. And before we do that of course let's jump right into the
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.680]   disclosures. This material is for research purposes only. C60 oil is not
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.880]   approved for consumption by the FDA. This is not medical or health advice. This is
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.440]   not a product endorsement. I do not sell any C60 products and I don't get
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.360]   paid in any way to do videos. This is purely me sharing my research that I do
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.480]   on C60. So let's jump right into the material. First things first before we
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.680]   could talk about what the health benefits are it's important to understand
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.280]   just the very very basics of how C60 works as a health supplement. So the
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.240]   number one thing is a C60 molecule a carbon 60 molecule comprised of 60
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.120]   carbon atoms in a little soccer ball shape is a super antioxidant. That means
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.680]   it has an extra electron that it can donate to anything in your body that's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.200]   called a free radical that is short one electron. So you've got essentially any
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.760]   oxidants are electron donors and free radicals are electron Steelers and so
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.560]   what happens when you get a free radical in your body and that's like
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.920]   chemicals and and all the nasty stuff that's in air water and food and when it
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.000]   gets into your body or comes through your skin what it's going to do because
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.440]   it's an electron Steelers it's at the literally at the quantum biology level
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.400]   of your cells that molecule is going to come in and it's going to steal an
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.000]   electron from one of your healthy cells and when that when it does that it's
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.880]   going to disable that cell and when that cell becomes disabled and you times
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.360]   that by millions and millions and millions it's going to create inflammation
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.960]   it's going to cause disease it's going to create damage and free radicals aren't
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.360]   really really bad for you and one of the leading causes of aging so antioxidants
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.000]   like vitamin C vitamin E C 60 hydrogen these things come in and they are
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.040]   electron donors and what happens in this diagram as you can see on the right is
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.160]   any antioxidant has an extra electron it then goes ahead and gives it to the
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.240]   free radical it pairs it up neutralizes it and boom it's it neutralizes the free
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.440]   radical and the damage actually the threat of damage is then extinguished and then
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.160]   your body can then go ahead and start healing the damage that was caused by
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.240]   the free radical okay that's really that's really the number one thing
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.840]   everything else is is secondary and beneficial so the other thing is that
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.040]   it's what's really interesting about C 60 you do the reading is it's a
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.040]   selective free radical scavenger meaning it just doesn't go after every
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.080]   single one that it finds it's very selective and it seems to have this very
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.720]   unique property and of course you know this the science is only about let's
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.800]   less than 30 years and that people have been studying C 60 which isn't a whole
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.560]   lot a lot of time but it's able to selectively go after the toxic free
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.360]   radicals because there are there's actually free radicals that you are
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.520]   beneficial to you and but C 60 specifically goes after the ones that are
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.600]   toxic and bad for you which is an amazing property that scientists are still
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.960]   studying it's also very very small a C 60 molecule is one nanometer and it's
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.840]   really it's so tiny it's 60 atoms that it's able to pass through the blood
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.680]   brain barrier so if it touches you if it gets into your bloodstream it's gonna
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   go everywhere in your body there's nowhere that little tiny molecule cannot
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.760]   go and then it's also indestructible and what I mean by that first of all it's
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.960]   molecular shape makes it really really hard and you got to remember now diamonds
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.440]   are made out of carbon atoms as well so I'm not saying that C 60 is as hard as
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.640]   a diamond what I'm saying is that it's made out of carbon atoms and it's very
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.280]   indestructible from a strength standpoint from its atomic bonds to other atoms
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.640]   but more so as an antioxidant what's real interesting about C 60 if you let's
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.280]   say compared to hydrogen hydrogen is H2 and it's like a gas a lot of people
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.160]   that are taking C 60 are also drinking hydrogen water because hydrogen is also
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.640]   a super antioxidant and the thing about hydrogen as an antioxidant is when it
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.680]   goes into your body and it it's basically in your body and it's H2 and what it's
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.200]   gonna go after is that free radical oxygen that O1 atom that's in your body
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.800]   that's doing all that damage it's gonna go after that oxygen molecule but the
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.600]   minute that the H2 molecule grabs on to the oxygen molecule right as as this
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.720]   whole electron donation procedure has happening it then automatically becomes
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.840]   H2O and what's that it's water so then it just gets flushed right out of
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.000]   your system but it's no longer hydrogen it's hydrogen it now becomes H2O when
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.920]   it's water so it's destruct it gets destroyed as an antioxidant and it gets
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.240]   flushed through you when C 60 goes in there and donates an electron once it
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.240]   once it basically does its job it's still there it's still doing its job it has
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.800]   other properties that it's gonna continue to to you know benefit your body and so
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.600]   it's it's really a very unique property of C 60 and the last thing about C 60 is
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.880]   it's a caged full marine now this isn't really coming up and all of the
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.880]   research that I've seen in terms of like what is doing for people because what
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.960]   this property of C 60 in terms of health is extremely unique and there's really
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.520]   no other molecules that do this other than the caged full marine molecules is
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.080]   that it has the ability because of its shape to capture other atomic particles
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.600]   and then transfer and then carry that through your body because it itself is
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.440]   can cross the blood brain barrier if it grabs onto another molecule or
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.080]   grabs onto another atom it could drag that puppy with it as it crosses that
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.000]   blood brain barrier and go places where the other drug itself or the actual
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.760]   molecule itself would not possibly go so a lot of scientists are studying how
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.360]   they can use C 60 as a carrier for other drugs in the in the body and so
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:09.320]   here's an example of h2 which is a C 60 at a molecule with a hydrogen atom inside
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.640]   or hydrogen you know h2 atom to atom so hydrogen comprises hydrogen gas and then
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.800]   you've got h2o it's you've got a wall or molecule inside of a C 60 molecule and
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   then this one is hydrogen fluoride inside of a of a C 60 molecule but these are
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.960]   all the different examples that I'm finding in the literature of how scientists
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.040]   are deciding okay how can we use this property of C 60 so enough about how it
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.560]   works this gives you the general idea so let's jump in now what are the health
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.120]   benefits you 60 so what I did was a lot of scouring the internet and trying to
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.240]   find the sources of basically what the benefits were because remember now okay
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.120]   the interest in C 60 really became acute in 2012 when there was a rat study
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.600]   from the University of Paris in 2012 published a rat study that really kind
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.680]   of took the the industry the health industry by storm the health industry
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.800]   meaning the people that are really into anti-aging and longevity and so the
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.720]   first group of folks that went after C 60 as as a as a possible supplement
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.880]   were the bio hackers the people that are really into it and and a lot of them
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.520]   hang out on a forum called Long City and so I went to Long City just to see what
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.640]   was some of the stuff that they were able to pull and determine as they
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.360]   started human trials themselves using themselves as human beings to take the
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.880]   the C 60 as a supplement and see what happened to them and they started
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.840]   literally in 2012 they started so they've been doing it for about six years now
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.540]   other people have started taking it and and so forth but there is no actual
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.560]   published human trial the only scientific studies out there on C 60 as a
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.920]   supplement are all done with with small mammals you know and and the biggest
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.000]   thing is probably a dog and so but most of it's like rats and mice and so
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.960]   there's been a lot of really good stuff that's come out of it like it's not
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.040]   toxic and blah blah blah like I just described but in terms of trying to
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.560]   determine what the actual health benefits are it is 100% anecdotal so be
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.680]   very clear that the information I'm about to provide is anecdotal it is what
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.520]   people are saying it's testimonial it is not a science double-blind placebo
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:23.720]   type based study it is the quote I would say the unofficial informal human trial
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.720]   of C 60 out in the public and here you go this is what people have been saying so
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.760]   the very first thing is you go to the original group of guys that started
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.800]   taking it and and you could basically look this up yourself feel free by the
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.080]   way as you know all my videos everything you can link to is gonna be in the
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.760]   video description so all the links are in there if you want to go ahead and
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.720]   check this stuff out it is interesting so first things first is what are the
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.960]   health benefits that the biohackers found and that's they found it was more
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.680]   energy now you take it and you get more energy and anyone taking it knows that
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.040]   that's what it does you have you need less sleep it has a mental
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.320]   improvements there's a there's a level of of clarity and and and just your mind
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.800]   is able to really function some people take it right before they got a study
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.320]   before they got to take a test you know when you go to work whatever but it
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:16.200]   really does improve your mental acuity and then for the guys that work out and
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.080]   the athletes that were taking C 60 and have been taking it they're reporting
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:24.000]   that they can lift much heavier weights you know sometimes to the point where
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.840]   they can you know it's like no pain no gain but too much and then also they
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:34.080]   can do more reps and as they're working out it also is tremendous in terms of
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:39.800]   just reduction in stress stress not only from like you know oxidative stress from
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.680]   free radicals but more so stress and like you know daily daily driving through
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.000]   traffic kind of stress and also a lot of people reported that they can run
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.560]   longer and you know the joggers and with more effective utilization of oxygen
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.360]   less fatigue and that sort of thing additional comments at Long City where
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.400]   they could run faster higher libido that was definitely something reported by a
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:09.800]   lot of men and also their faster recovery of damage from sunburns was which is an
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.800]   interesting aspect that was reported from the people these are guys now they've
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.240]   been taking it the longest of any one of us okay now since these guys have been
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.560]   taking it there's been a whole nother second wave of people that have been
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.880]   taking it and reporting results and some of these reports have been compiled and
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.480]   so if you go to now now David C 60 Labs done a really good job he's taken these
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.640]   these primary bullets and he's kind of listed them out added some studies so
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.240]   you can get a lot of good background information at his site where he's
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.920]   basically gone into the fact of you know C 60 can improve longevity it's a
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.960]   protection against the free radicals as I mentioned it prevents inflammation and
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.360]   that that is a byproduct of reducing the oxidative stress and it kills
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.960]   bacteria and it kills viruses very important it also protects your nerves
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.480]   it prevents osteoporosis I'm sorry osteo osteoarthritis and it improves
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.200]   I'm sure that I'm not sure a process is probably arthritis okay I'm good I've
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:12.440]   digress and then it improves obesity and metabolic syndrome so some really great
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.920]   benefits and now if there's a little a couple more benefits that I found on a
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:22.120]   site called slice 60 calm and it gets into the UV damage it gets into it
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.240]   actually can prevent damage from stroke and heart attack which is real
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.760]   interesting people are using it as an acne treatment and people are using it
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.560]   for hair loss and reporting that you know they're actually getting improvements
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:39.400]   in growing their hair back so other possible benefits and now this is where
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.840]   it gets interesting is this is what I'm reading from people I know on Twitter
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:48.400]   so courtesy of Twitter this is what's been real interesting in terms of some
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.920]   of the health benefits due to its what it can do is that it protects against
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:59.680]   poison oak so Twitter friend basically reported that he fell into a patch of
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.240]   poison oak earlier in the summer this summer and he had a lifetime of being
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.000]   severely reaction having severe allergic reactions when touching poison oak his
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.800]   whole life he falls into it and nothing happens he'd been taking CCC for six
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:19.000]   months and when nothing happened no rash no reaction nothing he just really
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.960]   blew his mind because it was funny because he'd been asking me for six
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.960]   months you know I don't feel anything I don't feel anything nothing's happening
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.920]   in and work I was trying to just coach you know coach him like I'll try this
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.800]   try that you know but the idea was was you know he didn't think it was doing
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.600]   anything he didn't think it worked until he fell into poison oak now I don't
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.840]   recommend you do that to figure out if it's working but that's amazing and so
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.520]   let's just kind of like figure out well why why did that work well obviously
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.400]   what's poison oak it's a natural chemical what it what does C-60 do well
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.320]   if it goes out and chopped in it just chumps up you know tech chemicals anything
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.040]   that's toxic to you and in and it's basically protected him because it was
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.040]   in his body when he fell into that poison oak now I'm gonna jump right to
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.240]   this one right here that is the exact same thing that happened to me I have a
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:10.600]   I don't know as I get older the last I'd say 20 years I've developed a
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.760]   severe reaction to MSG and for those of you who suffer from that you
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.640]   understand completely what that means MSG monosodium glutamate is an additive
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.880]   food additive that's also a neural toxin severely bad for you every Chinese
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.960]   place every Asian place dumps it in there like by the bucket load Japanese
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.040]   food has it and it's also goes by a multitude of different names like
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.840]   natural flavors and so I've had to really have a very restrictive diet
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:44.040]   because of my my problem with MSG and then I've been taking C-60 since last
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.100]   October I have to avoid certain restaurants and these are all foods that I
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.880]   absolutely love one of them is Korean food and there's this one place and they
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.200]   load up on MSG and I had to give up eating there many many years ago and
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:02.040]   of course you know that sucks so for whatever reason a month or so two
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.400]   months ago I decided you know what the hell I'm I just you know I'm gonna just
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.600]   suck it up and I yeah I know I'm gonna have a reaction it's gonna take three or
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.760]   four days to you know go through it it's horrible I don't like it but I don't
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.720]   know I just was kind of one of those moods and I decided I dammit I want to
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:23.720]   get a plate of Korean food and so I did and I woke up the next day actually it
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.920]   was that night because it usually hits me like within six hours and basically I
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.960]   didn't notice another happen the next day I realized you know like wow wait a
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.120]   minute nothing's happening they too nothing happened day three nothing
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.240]   happened I'm like oh my god so then about a week later I'm like well I'm gonna
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.560]   try this again cuz man I really like you know I like you know I love eating
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.840]   there so I went back and I tried a different Chinese restaurant I went to
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.240]   a Korean place I went to Chinese place these places had used I had to give up
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.880]   eating there because it was so bad and now I could eat it and it nothing happens
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:59.080]   to me it is just unreal I am just blown away by by what C60 does to this poison
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.760]   that comes into my body through the food now of course I don't recommend you
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.280]   guys go eat poison just to test this but you know that's what happened to me
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.640]   also this returns hair to youthful color I'm gonna show you a little screen shot
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.640]   of folks on Twitter talking about and these are individual folks just
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.760]   volunteering that hey their hair is changing color back to their youthful
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.840]   color improves eyesight I'm actually going through that right now in the last
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:27.680]   two weeks I changed formulas change my routine in terms of what I'm doing with
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.160]   C60 and this is the second time this has happened to me but yeah it improves
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.640]   your eyesight and it kind of sucks in a way because you know I'm in between
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.040]   glasses if you know what I mean so right now I'm having a really hard time
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.040]   seeing with my classes because my site has improved beyond the ability for my
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.400]   classes to help me which really screws life up because I know better than to go
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.600]   and buy more glasses and then you know that sort of thing so I'm gonna kind of
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.680]   wait till it levels out and make sure it's permanent before I go get a new
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.040]   set of classes if I have to at all but I have a hard time now using glasses
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.960]   because I could see better improves libido we covered that said now that
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.440]   sustained energy throughout the day is a real another thing that comes up a lot
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.360]   and then also to one of the folks on Twitter gave it to their dog and their
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.160]   dog had like a baseball sized tumor in a shrunk it now they did report within
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.440]   three months later it came back and so you know so it's you know it's just a
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.560]   matter of okay well it did it did it it grew back so you know I'm gonna give it
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.560]   more and so so I think they're working on it at this point to see what's gonna
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.880]   happen next but it definitely did something and because of that I actually
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.920]   have been giving it to my dog which is a whole nother story so what I'd like to
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:42.120]   do right now is share with you some testimonies that I got off of YouTube
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:47.280]   because one of the things about trying to get we know trying to figure out what
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.120]   the health benefits are okay well we know what C60 does and so let's go and
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.920]   find out you know because of what it does you know what can you know what are
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.560]   the benefits and I just went through a bunch of pages of benefits from different
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.760]   websites that have compiled it but here's what I'd like to share with you is I
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:09.960]   went and compiled it I went to several interviews of C60 individuals and I
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:15.160]   went through the comment section and this is my logic is that you know you
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.320]   can go to a website of somebody who sells something and then there's
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.960]   testimonials there like you know Amazon and we all know that Amazon reviews or
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.840]   iffy we all know that Yelp reviews or iffy you know in terms of its accuracy
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:33.420]   and weight so you know you take with a grain of salt now way I look at YouTube
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:38.760]   comments is yes also to people do go in there and pump stuff up but what was
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.400]   interesting is that in these interviews in these comments you know no one's
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.800]   trying to sell anything during the interview and so you look at the comments
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.280]   and people are volunteering their short their stories and I think that this is
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.720]   probably you know until something better comes along I think this is a
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.560]   probably a really good place to see what people are truly experiencing in terms
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.720]   of trying to compile you know the antidote evidence of what CC can do for
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.640]   you for us for you and and so forth so YouTube comments were people without
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:13.320]   being asked voluntarily with no motive and no bias shared their stories so let's
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.400]   go ahead so I put them all on a document there's a link in the video
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.880]   description you can go ahead and read the whole thing yourself I'm just gonna
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.440]   go over the highlights so here we go Rita Zant basically says hey I'm 76 years
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.800]   old her business was failing because she couldn't work his heart I mean at 76
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.800]   God bless you you know you're still working and but she started taking C 60
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:38.360]   says Dr. New what didn't know Dr. New what to do about five weeks ago I started
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.720]   taking C a carbon 60 in larger doses now I can walk without gimping around and
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.640]   my back and side don't hurt as bad my feet are getting better and finally
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.360]   restless leg syndrome is improving so that it's not keeping her up all night

[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.560]   difference especially in my legs now this is a different Joe it changed my
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.440]   life I work at a hardware store moving lumber and throwing 80-pound concrete

[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.760]   support what they said regarding eyesight I got a new script after one year of

[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:17.920]   percent reduction in heavy metals so you know I mean it just goes on and it's
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:23.920]   amazing this one I just found and it's basically from a guy called Field Notes

[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:37.240]   discomfort that was always going on in the background to none my eleven year
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:42.200]   old 80 pound dog who needed to be lifted into the truck to go anywhere now can
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:47.560]   jump in on his own I feel like both of us have been given a second chance that
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:55.200]   is awesome Earl reports I find I only need five or six hours of sleep a day
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.120]   instead of eight hours my wife and I have been taking it for nine months now I
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:04.000]   work out a lot and at 70 age of years I found that if I pulled a muscle it took
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:11.080]   forever to heal now it takes day or two and I'm back at it you know that's
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:16.920]   amazing here's a big nut productions my hunger has fallen off significantly to
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:22.560]   I was overweight and have now lost 25 pounds since starting C 60 over seven
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.560]   months ago I just want to add on the side that I started taking C 68 months
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.240]   ago and without doing anything different I've lost two inches off my waist and I
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.560]   don't even I'm really happy with that and it's given me a lot of encouragement
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.120]   to kind of just get more aggressively trying to lose weight but I I I'm like
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:45.400]   mirroring so many of these these things myself from my own personal reaction to
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.760]   C 60 so you know reading this stuff is really cool for me and I'm happy to share
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.840]   it with you so now here's Ray basically says the spacing in my spine is gone I
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.040]   felt a reduction in back muscle stiffness and increase in energy starting on day
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.960]   five which remains okay now so here's the the screenshot now what I did was on
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.560]   Twitter I was tweeting about a video there's about three to four people on
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:14.000]   YouTube that share their testimonies about C 60 probably more than that I
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.600]   just don't see them all but there's this one guy things name is synergy 70s like
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.760]   the cat lady guy you know he's got this whole feral colony started out which is
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.960]   one been following this guy for a while but he's really in the cats anyway so
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.480]   he did he did a video about his hair was turning darker and he's like our
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.840]   age right he's in the middle-aged guy and so I shared that that video with
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:41.040]   everybody on my feed and right away Paul jumps in and says my wife's hair
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:46.200]   color was also was restored to awesome his wife's and then Brian comes in and
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.400]   says yes my wife was just commenting on my greatly reduced gray she thinks
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:56.760]   perhaps by half wow and then Carmel Santiago says my hair too my two grand
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.080]   kids made the gracious unsolicited comments isn't that nice and you know so
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.520]   that's amazing I mean just think about the reality that it changes your hair
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.840]   color and but you know but it doesn't happen everybody but you know just these
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.560]   are testimonies so again I'm gonna say this again no one asks these people what

[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.960]   amazing I mean it just is absolutely amazing how it's helping people and so
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   you know I just wanted to share that with you okay so now that we've kind of
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:25.080]   gone through the list of compiled specific health benefits we've gone
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.040]   through how it works we've gone through some testimonies I really would like to
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.960]   just let's just kind of do a summary real quick so we're all on the same page
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:36.800]   so here's the things you need to consider about how it can help you all
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.760]   right and and the number one thing the absolute most important thing is please
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.480]   please everyone and anyone that you talk with about this or suggested to that
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.360]   it's for research purposes only it is not approved by the FDA there's been no
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.400]   human trials scientists have only gotten as far as rats and dogs all right I mean
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:59.720]   and they're great results but it's still experimental so let's not get too
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.560]   ahead of ourselves it's really a cool and awesome supplement that can do
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.320]   benefits that are amazing but it's research okay so if you take it you're
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:13.920]   researching you are your own guinea pig and so you know there's a huge amount
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.640]   of responsibility that you have to take for this and obviously pregnant women
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.480]   should not be experimenting with anything that's not proven absolutely
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.440]   100% for obvious reasons and also children you know outside or inside the
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.480]   womb you know it's just these should be off limits to research I believe that's
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.240]   my personal opinion okay then the other thing too as you know I've been as you
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.280]   can imagine because I do these videos I interact with a lot of people about c60
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:46.280]   and watch out for the detox effect it could really it could really punch in
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:51.440]   the gut bad and what I mean by that is the hertzheimer reaction if you've
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:56.920]   never heard of that it's basically if c60 gets in and basically neutralizes a
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.840]   bunch of toxins in you your body has to flush that out and your body may not be
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.640]   strong enough to do that or capable or your overwhelming your body which is
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:11.120]   mostly what happens with all those you know basically let's just crud you know
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.120]   that's coming out of you and so there's gonna be a detox effect so if you study
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.760]   up on hertzheimer let me see if I can find a document I'll throw that in the
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:26.320]   video description as well symptoms of the over detoxing to detoxing too fast
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:30.640]   kind of thing hurts timers is you could have flu-like symptoms you could get
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.700]   rashes you could get headaches you know so there's different things that could
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:39.840]   happen to you if you detox too fast so if you're completely new to detoxing in
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   general if you haven't been taking a lot of supplements that are like vitamin E
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:49.280]   vitamin C glutathione and all of these other types of detoxing antioxidants
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:55.000]   then you need to go really really slow and be very careful and so and just and
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.960]   be very very aware of your body and if you start to have any effects you know
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:04.000]   just throttle back as you decide to try C60 okay so watch out for that detox
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.880]   effect it does catch a lot of people that I've talked to and now age plays a
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.520]   role now if you were listening to the testimonial piece right there's a lot
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.840]   of folks in there that are on the upper side of 50 and so and and this is
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:22.920]   something I covered in I think my third video the one on dosing is that you know
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.240]   it we all you know it's bio accumulation of stuff in our lifetimes and certain
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.920]   people have a lot more stuff I know an individual who's been a gunsmith and
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:35.440]   man that guy's had chemicals on his hands for 30 years right he is so
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:39.480]   toxic it's you know and he's trying to detox out but he's like you know like
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.080]   a hundred times worse than anybody I know because of his hands have been
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.800]   touching chemicals for so long people who clean are exist as bad anyone that
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.000]   works in the any type of industry where you've got your hands or your
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.560]   breathing or your touching or anything chemicals and things like that so yeah
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:02.240]   we all have a different levels of of of a toxic load and so your age the more
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.080]   older you are probably the higher toxic load so and because you have a higher
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.160]   toxic load you're more likely gonna feel something immediately the minute that
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.600]   C 60 under your body and starts cleaning you up so it's the older you are it
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:18.480]   seems like the more pronounced the benefits are going to be also be very
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.520]   careful with pre-existing conditions in general health now something that did
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:26.600]   happen to me that I haven't talked about till right now is that I for the last
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.520]   three years or four years actually I had a kidney stone each year for three
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:36.640]   years in a row except this year and and and so I I'm you know discovered in my
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:43.880]   my my older age that I am susceptible to kidney stones and so because of that
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:49.920]   when I was taking unfiltered C 60 the extra carbon floating in it that
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:55.680]   wasn't filtered out put a stress on my kidneys and it and really really really
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:00.400]   gave me some trouble so if you've got conditions such as kidney issues
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:06.400]   especially if you got conditions such as liver issues and all that oil I mean
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.240]   there's I'm sure you can talk to your own doctor and then you say I want to
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.440]   take a teaspoon oil every day you don't have to tell them they're C 60 and he's
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.440]   gonna look you go hey you might not want to take that much oil you know I mean
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:20.720]   if you got liver issues and so you know be real careful about your health if
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.920]   you're really super sick leave got lots of problems again stream caution you
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:32.000]   know because it may or may not affect you negatively and this goes to with the
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.680]   idea to of medicines and this is a little chat that I had this week with
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:42.080]   someone about medicines and whether or not medicines and other supplements
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.040]   would be affected if you take C 60 and the answers of course it would look at
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:51.560]   what C 60 does right and so what is medicine it's a chemical what are
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:56.200]   vitamins well vitamins are minerals right and so C 60 will neutralize
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:02.160]   metals as that one testimony you saw 70% reduction in heavy metal so if you're
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.720]   taking iron you're taking all these different metals you got to remember if
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:09.760]   you're taking C 60 it's gonna leach out it's gonna pull some of that out of you
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.120]   so you might want to up your dose a little bit to compensate but you got to
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:18.080]   play with it you know but I'm just saying be aware that C 60 will affect
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:22.320]   medicines you're taking it'll affect anything else you're taking okay because
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:26.520]   of what it does so your pre-existing conditions and your general health play
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:31.320]   a vital role in what health benefits are for you okay now results very greatly as
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:35.680]   you saw from the testimonials and from all the bullet items yeah it's all over
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.280]   the map and it really kind of goes back to that toxic load thing you know where
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.480]   are you most having a problem with and you know you that's where you're probably
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.520]   gonna feel it like someone who grew up around led their whole life and you know
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.320]   where lead goes when you it goes up in your freaking head and so you might
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.960]   experience as that lead goes away you might feel experience more stuff with
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:58.120]   your brain than someone who let's say took you know has been around another
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.640]   chemical that was you know like basically you know putting stress on
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.680]   their pancreas or whatever you know what I'm saying so the whole idea though
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:11.440]   it's it's very it results very greatly the results are very sporadic okay I've
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:17.840]   had you know over the last eight months my benefits you know go up and down the
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.720]   scale backwards and forwards I mean like I'll have improved eyesight for three
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.320]   weeks and then nothing happens and then all of a sudden something new happens
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.120]   and like my back won't hurt and you know it's just it's all over the map and
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.360]   it's kind of weird a lot of people report that that you know it just it
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.000]   all these different benefits are happening and coming and going and and so
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.160]   it is very sporadic C-60 just running around your body doing stuff you know
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:43.720]   it's all positive but it's like yeah it's sporadic and it's very subtle there is
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:48.400]   an interview on a web on a YouTube channel for a lady named Gwen Foster she
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:52.240]   interviews Chris Burr as who is one of the co-founders of SES research that
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:57.200]   providers of C-60 powder for the 2012 rat study and so that guy has been in
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.120]   the business longer than anyone in terms of C-60 production so Chris was
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:05.140]   interviewed by Gwen and in that interview it's really it's really
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:09.600]   interesting where Gwen starts talking about how you know it's like some people
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.960]   don't feel anything and they contact her and she's I guess she's a nutritionist
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:17.680]   or something and or health person and and so and then the way she looks at it
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.800]   which I really thought was very you're very unique and I think it was very
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:26.680]   helpful the way she looked at how you could tell you know is C-60 doing
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.520]   anything because for the longest time my first six weeks on C-60 I started with
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.200]   purple power I didn't feel nothing I just felt itchy for a whole month and
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.880]   that was that detox thing other than that I didn't feel anything positive and I
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:41.000]   thought the thing wasn't working at all and it was all crap right but I kept
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.760]   going and you know there you go you know where I'm at now so but the whole idea
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:48.800]   though is it was really it was subtle and so just like with my friend with the
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.120]   poison oak okay he for six months the guy thought it wasn't working and he
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.080]   just kept at it kept at it because everybody else kept saying it's great
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.440]   you know so he just kept taking it but nothing happened and he was and he was
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:04.960]   he was just about to I think or I think he just did stop taking it because on
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.200]   that advice that I'm sharing with you with the Gwen Foster interview of Chris
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:12.960]   Burris she talks about people who say nothing's happening you know what you
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.600]   know this stuff doesn't work and what she says to them is is really kind of
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:21.040]   unique and she says well don't look at as as like oh you have more energy but
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.960]   look at it like okay well think back the last few weeks that you were on it
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.520]   compared to the time before that you know are you getting more stuff done and
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.240]   you know in her and in the interview she goes yeah you know her friend goes
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.740]   yeah well I cleaned out the closet first time in 10 years and then another friend
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.400]   you know I did this and that and she goes yes see it's not so much you know
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:44.120]   you it's so subtle you may not feel that you're getting more energy but if you
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:49.200]   stop and think you're getting more stuff done and isn't that energy right and
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.800]   so that's just one perspective but it is very subtle and some people they
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.360]   actually have to stop taking it for a while look back at the period of time
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.800]   that they were before they realize wow when I'm on it I actually get more stuff
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.400]   done or I do more I feel better whatever but you don't feel it until you stop
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.480]   taking it that's people have done that as well so it's subtle the last the
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:15.760]   last two bullets here is the when and how to take C60 that's kind of you know
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:21.040]   that's just up to different individuals the general consensus are most people
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:27.440]   believe you should take it on an empty stomach and and I do but I also take it
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:32.360]   with my morning protein shake so so you know you can do it either way on on on
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:40.720]   whoops that's not helpful okay so when and how to take it so that was
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:45.160]   distracting boy I lost my turn thought oh wait when so take it with food not
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:49.920]   take it with food you know practice tests see what happens for you and then
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:55.280]   also how to take it taking it like like I do I put it in a protein shake or
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:00.760]   taking it sublingling under the tongue you know that sort of thing mainly though
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:07.160]   people take it in oil that's another aspect of taking it 99.9% of people take
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:12.080]   it in in dissolved in oil and so that that's the whole aspect of how do you
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.160]   want to take it and then the other thing to consider is that too much oil is
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.640]   bad for your liver covered that alright so let's move on to the next topic which
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:25.080]   is where can you buy C60 okay so for those of you been following my videos
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.720]   you know that I've been doing a pricing guide and it all started with eight
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:34.520]   months ago I was shopping for C60 and I wanted to figure out you know you know
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:38.960]   what sites carried it and for how much and so I made this list and then I just
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.560]   kept it up and then I started doing videos and so I just kept doing it and
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.000]   doing it and doing it and it went from this little tiny shortlist to this thing
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.920]   that I've done now which is this is where you buy C60 for those of you who
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.840]   don't want to make it yourself which is a whole nother subject I got lots of
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:58.200]   videos on making yourself which by the way if you do make it yourself it's a
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:02.360]   lot cheaper anyway but let's talk about buying C60 so this is the updated
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:09.120]   pricing guide as of July 25th 2018 so now it is it is as from the last pricing
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:15.000]   guide the market is blowing up literally in the number of people that are making
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.120]   C60 oil and selling it on Amazon and eBay and coming up with their own websites
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:24.840]   and hey you know power to you all you know that just makes it that much more
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.920]   available to everybody which is awesome and so what I've done though is I'm
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.640]   trying really not to keep at him this list could get really long so I'm just
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:38.160]   kind of just sticking with this group of folks these groups of providers of the
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.280]   C60 in olive oil and and just gonna stick with this list right here and that's
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:47.120]   kind of be what I'm gonna do for a while now but the whole idea here is now the
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.600]   pricing guide is for this is C60 in olive oil by the way link in the
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:54.720]   description below you can grab a copy this and then this is C60 in other oils
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:38:00.440]   and then C60 specialty products and then raw C60 I added a new section here so
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:04.280]   that's all in one document so here let's pop back up to here so now this is where
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.480]   you can go buy it so these are all the different people that sell it and then
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.360]   this the way you read this guide is that right here I take all of the
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:16.720]   different sizes of bottles and all of the different prices per vendor based on
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:20.480]   what bottle size and it's all right in here but I break it all down so that it's
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.920]   buy ounce you can compare apples to apples okay and then it's listed low to
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:31.960]   high so you know holding fast at the least expensive C60 in olive oil on the
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:36.920]   market is good and cheap they sell on Amazon and they're 540 an ounce and then
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:42.520]   it goes all the way up to Axiom which sells organic and and they really go
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:47.400]   with that whole everything super organic and non chemo and I mean I love
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.240]   that kind of you know that's that's my life right there so it's really cool he
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:55.240]   goes way into that healthy healthy healthy you know aspect and and he's
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:59.480]   selling his C60 product and it's 2274 pounds and then you've got
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:04.320]   everybody in between the purity here is just simply the purity level of the C60
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.720]   the raw C60 in the product and then this is the amount the milligrams per
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:15.080]   milliliters of C60 in the oil the standard is based off of that rat study
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.680]   I mentioned earlier 0.8 milligrams per milliliter is the standard and then our
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:23.320]   vendors that have taken that number in and really ratcheted it up because 0.8
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:28.240]   milligrams per milliliter is not the quintessential end all number it is just
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.520]   what the rat study used okay so people should be aware of that so what's
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:37.520]   interesting from this standpoint is is comes in lots of different bottle sizes
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.080]   prices over here but you know what for you guys in the market I've been keeping
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:46.160]   track of the average price per ounce since day one and it's just amazing and
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:52.600]   this is this is good for the consumer not so good for the manufacturer but
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:56.360]   bottom line this is economics at play right supply and demand and so for the
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:03.200]   last eight months there's been a 40.5% decrease in C60 in olive oil by the
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.480]   ounce okay so that is huge win for the consumer and it just shows that the more
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:11.960]   people that want something the bigger the industry grows and the cheaper the
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.720]   end product comes and that that goes with everything but it's kind of a cool
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.800]   number I like to share and then for those of you guys who are selling this
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.360]   you need to kind of keep an eye on this on this rate of descent and and all your
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:25.160]   costs and you know this this is the business side of it too for you guys but
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:29.720]   right now the average is 1060 for the top 10 so when you're out there shopping
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:36.200]   for C60 in olive oil keep in mind that the average price is $10 an ounce and
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:41.320]   and that's to basically in a price comparison to all the other different
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:46.480]   competitors out there and that's an olive oil and that's just purely C60 in
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:51.000]   olive oil then you get into this and this is where it's a really exploded in
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.160]   addition to a whole bunch of extra people selling stuff in olive oil so the
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:59.080]   C60 in olive oil there's been a lot of movement in different oils and so I can
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.440]   see where because of the price compression here and the margin squeeze on your
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.960]   products in terms of olive oil products I can see where now the market is starting
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:13.160]   to see a greater availability of C60 in other oils now thing to keep in mind
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:18.240]   though that in olive oil the I consider these guys I call them the purists right
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:23.600]   and the purists are the guys who are trying to make a product that matches as
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.920]   close as possible to what the rat study did because the rat study is like the
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:34.960]   holy grail of what's possible with C60 okay and so it's and that's great and
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.080]   so if you're really really really really really a purist and you want to just go
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:43.560]   hey they did this exactly this way in the rat study and they got these results
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.920]   well I want to do that that's your experiment because remember this is all
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.400]   research then you should definitely stick with the purists and stay in olive oil
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.640]   but I want to make a point though that none of these guys I've looked at it none
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:42:00.420]   of them are using cum laude olive oil from Tunisia which is what the specific
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.240]   type of olive oil they were using in the rat study a lot of them are using the
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:09.880]   same C60 from SES and and they're using the same protocol of stirring it two
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:14.960]   weeks in the dark and blah blah blah but no one is doing it exactly the same but
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:19.440]   this is the closest that you're gonna get and if you really want to map to the
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:24.440]   rat study you know stick to olive oil but then there's a lot of guys that say
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:29.200]   hey you know a C60 is C60 it doesn't matter what oil you've got and then
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.200]   there's an argument that says well saturation rates you know blah blah blah
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.680]   but the idea though is that it does come in different oils and people are
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:42.640]   reporting tremendous benefits taking C60 in different oils okay especially like
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.480]   if you look at the purple power testimonial site that I showed you the
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:52.840]   link to and the C60 when I say C60 I mean carbon60.com C-60.com Bob Gressa's
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.120]   product now you look at those testimonial pages these are people that are
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:00.920]   reporting tremendous benefits and but one is in coconut MCT oil and one is in
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:04.480]   sunflower oil right and it's not even dissolved in sunflower oil so you know
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:08.760]   there are benefits being reported in different oils so if you're not a purist
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:13.080]   then you can try something else and take C60 in a different oil whole nother
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:16.040]   reason why you need to take it in the oil for those of you who are new go take
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:21.960]   a look at my my first three videos explains the rat study why is it why
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.440]   it's in oil and even if you're interested how to make your own in part
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:29.520]   three anyway so C60 and other oils now I broke it out into coconut oil and
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:33.760]   avocado oil separately because there's so many people that are doing it now and
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.080]   there's been new entrance into the coconut oil space and new entrance into
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:42.040]   the avocado space these are the price browns now now a lot of the coconut oils
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:47.520]   are MCT oil which is a different type of coconut oil it's more refined and it
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.000]   kind of excludes a certain kind of acid and focuses more on a particular one
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.840]   and so I'm not that into it but that's what people like go for it and so here's
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:02.160]   your best price rounds it is pricey in coconut oil and so you know something
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.960]   to keep in mind in avocado oil you can get it as low as 961 an ounce in avocado
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:11.880]   oil and then of course other oils so other oils is this is what's interesting
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:17.360]   there was a big explosion now C60 Labs you know David C60 he's the first guy
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.840]   to come out with like six different types of oils I mean really a wide
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.160]   variety and gives everybody an opportunity to kind of just choose what
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:28.120]   they like in terms of taste because some people may be allergic to avocados or
[00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:31.680]   they may be allergic to you know to olive oil or it gives them you know
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.960]   nobody likes that peppery taste you know etc right and so he has all these
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:39.160]   different brands and so he came out he's the first one that came out in hemp oil
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.080]   and now you've got three other folks that decided hey I'm gonna jump on the
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.720]   bandwagon compete against Dave and now they're selling theirs for a lot higher
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:51.920]   price in terms of just C60 in hemp oil you've actually got and then of course
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:58.240]   David's the only one that sells C60 in sunflower oil it actually dissolved in
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:03.360]   sunflower oil and then of course this new entrant which is a product called C60
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:07.680]   in pumpkin seed oil just popped up on the radar I thought that was interesting
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.720]   and I read it and I was like wow what the heck I've never even heard of pumpkin
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:14.600]   seed oil and then I researched pumpkin seed oil just by itself and it's like
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:18.800]   wow that stuff's really super good for you you know I never even thought about
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.000]   it you know so you know it's amazing what you learn as you kind of going
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.800]   through this stuff but yeah I mean there's somebody now doing it in pumpkin
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:31.440]   seed oil and a side note on the experimental side on the other side of
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.640]   the fence people making it themselves at home there has been tremendous
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:42.440]   success with people who are now making C60 oil using oil not from plants but
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:49.780]   from critters castor oil is one example that I'm aware of no I'm sorry not
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:55.360]   castor oil cod liver oil do not take castor oil sorry do not take that cod
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:00.720]   liver oil and so a friend on Twitter also shared with me his experiments
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:04.640]   making it cod liver oil and it just turned out beautifully purple and he
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:09.640]   taken it and he's getting benefits from it and so it works with any kind of oil
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:15.040]   and so whatever you're like you know you like to take then go ahead and so
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:19.040]   that's all of the different prices different bottle sizes and best price
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:24.240]   per ounce for these different types of oils if you want to try those oils okay
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:29.320]   the last thing too is this third page which is also where to buy and is the
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.840]   specialty products now I kind of dig the specialty I'm a tinkerer if you
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.720]   watch any of my other videos you know where I'm making all sorts of different
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:42.280]   kinds of concoctions C60 things I like to tinker and I really dig these guys I
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.680]   think they're pretty cool because they're taking it up a notch you know
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:52.240]   because you remember now the 2012 rat study was not a study about the best C60
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:56.680]   oil product that anyone could make and then get the rats to live forever no
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:00.560]   they just that was just like their default what they came up with just to
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:06.160]   deliver the C60 into the rat so that they would digest it and then the study
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:10.000]   was to how much C60 could we give a rat before it dies okay so it was a
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.520]   toxicity study it wasn't a C60 in oil study there's been in this there there
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:19.840]   has been C60 in oil studies and I can share that with you in another video but
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:24.000]   but that wasn't the study for that and so that does so what it means is like hey
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.240]   you know C60 benefits may or may not you can you might get better benefits in
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.920]   different oils you don't know or doing different things so so being in olive
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:37.000]   oil if you're a purist it's it's you know that's what the study did if you're
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.080]   not you want a tinker and you want to see if you can up your game and do better
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:44.080]   then you get into these specialty oils now what these are all very different now
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:49.080]   the champion 60 which and then there's a champion 60 x extra strength and then
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:54.120]   there's the carbon 60 plus and carbon 60 plus extra strength these four come
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:48:00.440]   from the same place and carbon 60 plus is licensing the card champion 60 brand
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.920]   so it's all pretty much the same oil and what it is it's a proprietary blend of
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:09.240]   oils and then there's actually additional enzymes added to the oil so
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:13.800]   it's not it's not any particular type of oil it's a combination of different oils
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:19.880]   and other supplements in the solution and also too because of their different
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:26.160]   recipe they're able to get the actual amount of C60 suspended in the oil up to
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:30.720]   1.0 milligrams per milliliters okay so like I was going back to saying you
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.560]   know 0.8 milligrams per milliliters is is not the you know it's not it's not a
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:38.880]   number set in stone so they were able to get it up to 1.0 and now they've just
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:43.520]   released a product with champion 60 extra strength where they are saying that it
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:49.200]   measures out at 1.2 milligrams per milliliters so it's even more C60 dissolved
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:54.640]   in the oil they came up with a different recipe so that it can hold more C60 it's
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:58.720]   so it's extra strength you can take it and you're actually absorbing more C60
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:04.760]   in less oil which is like awesome and so so that's the new product that just
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:10.120]   came out with life pet it's available at champion 60 X or champ I'm sorry champion
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:16.040]   six-year champ carbon 60 plus it has that blend special recipe with high
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:20.280]   strength and one of the things about their blend and because they're able to
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:24.640]   attain a higher level of C60 they're testing it out and they're claiming if
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:29.960]   you read their website the especially life pets website that the way that
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:36.320]   their blend is coming out it's coming out at 270 times stronger than vitamin C as
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:43.120]   an antioxidant because of their blend okay now if you read the rat study they
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:51.000]   calculated that C60 was 172 times stronger of an antioxidant than vitamin
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.680]   C that's sort of like a benchmark okay so the rat study says 172 life pet says
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:01.400]   hey we've measured it at 270 because of our special blend so that's really
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.840]   cool so anyone who hasn't tried this you know if you're interested in
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:10.320]   experimenting this is one you might want to consider another one is the C-60 now
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:15.160]   they're a monomolecular C60 suspended in sunflower oil it's not dissolved there's
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.600]   not a liposome it's just floating in there very pricey because there's a lot
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:25.040]   of carbon 60 in a little bottle there's only two products right now these guys
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:31.000]   right here that are actually blending carbon 60 with CBD oil and one is just
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.680]   carbon 60 with CBD oil and you can see it's really pricey and then the other one
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:40.800]   is wild which is canada carbon and if you know I've made two videos on CBD
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:46.760]   C60 oil and I've been able to get the price down my net price is like 47 bucks
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.840]   or something like that and so you know you can make it if you really want to do
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:55.160]   a combination CBD C60 then you know you I would say make it at home there's only
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.040]   like two products out there that you could buy it but if you really wanted
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:02.680]   to try it and the and of course you could take CBD oil separately from C60 oil
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:06.440]   right but if you're a tinkerer and you don't want to have as much oil you can
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:10.400]   blend the two together and have one that says like a power supplement so I
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:17.200]   make C60 CBD oil all the time and I take it daily in many different many
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.400]   different combinations so that's my thing with the CBD thing so here's
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:27.520]   canada carbon and then wild leaf hemp they also do the CBD in infusion and then
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.400]   they also add to America and the only thing about it was the way it's described
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:35.960]   is I don't understand it because when I said how much is in there the basically
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:40.280]   said they do it a certain way with plasma tech and they haven't invented a
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:46.720]   way to measure it so you know just a note of you know just caution that you know I
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:50.440]   come from a world where if you can't measure it it doesn't exist so you know
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.520]   but that's what they're claiming and then of course there's other website that
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.880]   also has the that whole plasma bonded thing and they're saying it's bonded
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:00.400]   with hydrogen and and they've got enzymes and stuff and that's yes lab so these
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:05.320]   are all very experimental very out there products but you know it's cool I think
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.680]   it's really cool that you've got specialty C60 products out on the market
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:12.160]   now for people who really kind of want to just go beyond the rat study and then
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:16.520]   this last section here I wanted to point out which was the raw C60 a lot of
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:20.000]   people all the time were asking where to get it and what's the best deal so here
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:28.640]   you go this is where you can buy C60 powder or C60 liquefied pulverized and
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:32.120]   you can go ahead and make it yourself and so I kind of just broke it there's a
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:36.920]   lot of different sizes but I just gave here's the one gram cost and then the
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:45.800]   five gram cost and the basic four basic purity levels 99.5 99.90 99.95 which is
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:51.600]   the 99.95 is the the main one that everybody uses from a commercial
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:57.160]   standpoint and then 99.99 or 99.98 you do see that that that just closest to
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:01.400]   perfection as you could get and at that purity rate and for those of you who
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.040]   are new to this anything that's under a hundred so the difference between let's
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:13.520]   say 99.95 means that 0.05 of what's in that carbon 60 is not carbon 60 it's
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:19.200]   either carbon 70 or amorphous carbon a different type of carbon that's in
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:23.720]   there they didn't get you know to pure C60 there's just a little tiny bit that's
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:28.520]   not C60 but it's it's it's C70 or something and that's that's the that's
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:33.440]   what purity means and this is mostly this is solvent free some places if they
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.200]   don't say it's solvent free you should ask and solvent free means that they
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:43.520]   made damn sure to burn off anything that touched that C60 to you know to
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:48.160]   synthesize it so that there's no toxins in the product that you're buying so
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:54.600]   here are the different vendors now there's six of them that are selling raw C60
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:58.880]   for those of you who like to make it you can get it as cheap as let's say
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:01.960]   let's say I'm gonna stick with 99.95 because I don't I don't really recommend
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:07.120]   anyone make C60 under nine to 0.95 and so you know you can get low as low as
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:11.720]   49 dollars at MTR MTR stands for materials technology research and they
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:18.360]   sell C60 for $49 gram and then there's red line that sells it for 73 gram you
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.280]   have to buy two grams at a time to get that price because that's the smallest
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:26.320]   bottle they sell Bucky Labs at 130 and then of course 155 and that's the price
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:29.680]   there and then you if you buy more it's a little cheaper and these are the prices
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:34.360]   at five grams most times it's cheaper not always okay and then there's
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:37.080]   Solaris and Solaris is a Canadian company so there are higher
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:41.040]   periods available there are larger quantities available and so forth so
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.760]   keep in mind if you want to make it at home now the big thing about here it's
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:52.120]   all of these are powdered C60 except red line okay red lion does something
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:55.760]   extremely different than anyone else and what they've done is they built their
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:02.400]   own technology to pulverize the C60 down to particulate sizes below 300
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:08.480]   nanometers which means extremely small it's like so small it you it's like a
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:12.840]   silt and I have a video that actually show the difference under the microscope
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:18.760]   so it's a whole different type of C60 it's way more complicated to use that to
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:23.080]   make C60 so if you're not kind of science literate you may want to just
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:26.360]   stick with the powders to make it if you're more like someone who likes to
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:30.920]   kind of like you know seek perfection and and really get into the science then
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:34.360]   you know definitely by all means red lines of superior product in terms of
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:40.360]   it being a pulverized one because the finer the particle size okay the more
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:44.040]   bio available it's gonna be for you alright so any so that's my pricing guide
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:49.360]   the link is in the video description feel free to grab a copy and and happy
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:54.120]   hunting you know these are all really great vendors and you know and there's
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:59.280]   so many choices now you know that you've really got kind of whatever you want to
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:02.880]   do I think you can find something that's gonna match that okay so now the last
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.960]   question we've got here is now how much should you take and I covered this in
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:12.640]   the dosage video I think number two part two in the three part series and so let
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.680]   me just go over with you again for those of you who didn't see that video how
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:20.880]   much you should take it all depends are you a purist or not but you know that
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:24.200]   2012 rat study the what they gave the rats remember now they were trying to
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:29.160]   kill the rats with c60 they gave them 1.7 milligrams per kilogram of body weight
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:34.440]   okay now if you tried to take 1.7 milligrams of kilograms from body weight
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:39.880]   near the average American male at 198 pounds okay that would roughly end up
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:45.760]   being like a full-on coke can of olive oil every day for seven days and then
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:50.560]   every other day for two weeks and etc right I mean I don't I think that oil
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:53.560]   that much oil would probably kill you I mean it just can't be good for you I
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.360]   mean okay didn't kill the rats guaranteed but it did damage their
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:01.280]   livers so I you know so nobody takes that much okay that would be like insane
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:05.840]   to drink that much oil based on what they try to do those rats so what
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:11.440]   everybody does is this they they apply just a simple algorithmic formula to it
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:16.640]   called allometric scaling and they just reduce it down to 30 percent of what
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:20.840]   they gave the rats and so now there's two websites out there that help you try
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:24.400]   to figure out what your dosage will be everybody else because it's quote
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:27.240]   research only they don't want to go there and I you know hey you give these
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:29.840]   guys credit they don't want to make anybody sick they don't want to be
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.080]   responsible they just sell it to you and you it's up to you you buy it with
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.320]   your knowledge of it being research and you're on your own okay but there are
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:41.440]   two websites that did I know for a fact that live pet it did has done testing
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.800]   on animals to find out no animals were harmed they all helped the animals by
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:51.440]   the way to find out what was the best way to dose okay so live pet by far and
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:56.360]   that's where this this this table comes from his courtesy of live pet and so they
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:59.920]   actually tried to they figured out the best way to do it and they followed the
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:04.360]   basic allometric scaling at 30 percent they followed the load and maintain
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:09.280]   protocol that was done in the rat's study the rat study was load them up and
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:14.400]   then maintain at a lower dose over time and so they follow that same thing so if
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:19.640]   you look at this table right here you will find that the dog and let's
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:24.480]   consider like I'm a 200 pound dog huh or whatever right and so if your dog
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:30.300]   quote your dog is this weight okay 81 to 100 and then of course you could
[00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:34.440]   calculate from there then you want to load up your starting dose will be higher
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:39.160]   than your maintenance dose so this is how much you would be taking so three
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:43.520]   teaspoons now three teaspoons equals one tablespoon right so if you're a hundred
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:47.280]   pounds or let's say you're the average American male you're about 200 pounds
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:54.440]   so that'd be two tablespoons right six six teaspoons or two tablespoons and then
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:59.120]   you would do that for ten days and then after that you would just do half that
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:02.840]   so you would do one tablespoon or one and a half teaspoons at a hundred pounds
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:07.840]   right you would do one tablespoon a day and then go forward okay and then of
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:13.200]   course they kind of cover how many days you could go at this rate and so you
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:16.760]   could know how many bottles to buy so you don't run out okay so that's right
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:20.400]   there you can go to live pet and you can actually take a look at the label on
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:24.040]   their bottles and it explains it in more detail but this is your basic formula
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:27.480]   on how much you should take if you're following the allometric scaling
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:33.200]   protocol and the load and maintain protocol of taking C 60 for you okay now
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:37.040]   the other thing is you go to Bucky Labs calm by the way you know links of course
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.400]   in the video description they have a thing called the dosage calculator and so
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:45.000]   they don't go with the load and maintain they just do the allometric scaling so
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.880]   this is really cool if you just want to just start taking the doses at the
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.640]   maintenance dose level you don't want to load up first which is fine you know
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.760]   totally up to you and it's just a different way of doing it and most
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:58.960]   people you know are whatever you just make your own decision what to do you
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:03.560]   can actually put your weight in there how many doses a week and then boom it's
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.240]   gonna tell you you know how big your bottle sizes and then you submit it'll
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:11.000]   tell you how much to take okay so dosage calculator at Bucky Labs calm or
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:18.120]   allometric dosage guide at live pet I think it's live pet LLC calm okay and you
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.800]   can that it can also help you to decide how much you want to take in your 200
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:29.160]   pound rat study of your own okay okay now lastly before I leave I just want to
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.440]   just kind of share with you something that's new on the horizon on the C 60
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:37.920]   world is that if you have questions and this is awesome because I always have
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:44.720]   questions then the founder of C 60 purple power has now started a every
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.080]   other week webinar live webinar anyone can join it's on Facebook and you can
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.040]   go and just throw questions at Ken and Ken just does a one-hour with his
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.320]   marketing director and they just sit there and answer questions that are put
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.800]   up so you'd have to go on to Facebook it's also live stream simultaneous on
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.520]   YouTube at their other YouTube channel but they won't take questions from
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:08.480]   YouTube they'll only take questions from their Facebook page so go to Facebook
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.320]   it's second and fourth Wednesday they just had one this two days ago today's
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.840]   Friday the 27th and so I sat in there and asked a question I think you'll even
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.240]   hear it that I asked a question and so if you have questions about anything I
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.800]   mean Ken Schwartz is the leading chemist that worked with the live longer labs
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.120]   guys Max champion Phil Cottolano he was their chemist on developing live
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.840]   longer labs product and then he broke off and then created a C 60 purple power
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:38.040]   so definitely if you got questions Ken's your guy he's he's by far an
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.920]   incredible expert and you can jump right on to Facebook two second and fourth
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:46.000]   Wednesday every month and you can go ahead and ask Ken and get your questions
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.480]   answered alright well that was a very long video thank you so much for sticking
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:55.240]   it out I really wanted to just do something that was real basic that could
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.960]   help people understand you know what what they could get out of it and where
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.220]   they could get it and of course how to how to take it in and I know that it was
[01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:06.000]   long and I just really want to just say thank you so much for stopping by thank
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.560]   you for watching my videos again you know thanks for the comments guys if it
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:16.280]   wasn't for all that positive reinforcement this would not be fun for me
