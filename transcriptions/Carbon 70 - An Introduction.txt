[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320]   Aloha and welcome to another video by me, Kay Elmer, and in this video I would like to
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.440]   talk with you about Carbon 70, or what I like to refer to as Carbon 60's Big Brother.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.200]   So before I can start chatting about that, let me have some disclaimers out there.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.280]   This material is for research purposes only.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.240]   C70 oil is not approved for consumption by the FDA.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.760]   This is not medical or health advice.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.520]   This is not a product endorsement.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.280]   I do not sell C70 products, and I do not get paid in any way to do videos.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.460]   For those of you who are new to my channel, I just want to share with you that the reason
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.560]   I do videos is because I just have a passion in my hobbies that I like to learn and study
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.760]   and analyze stuff, and right now I'm basically really interested in fullerenes.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.760]   I've been interested in fullerenes for about a year.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.640]   I've been taking C60 oil, and so I learned way back that people are really interested
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.960]   in what I've been learning, and I just wanted to start sharing.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.920]   And in sharing, I've learned that I've learned from other people, so I like to contribute
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.120]   to the body of knowledge that we all share together and we learn and we get better by
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.120]   working with each other.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.840]   So that's the purpose of the video.
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.840]   Let's jump in.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.200]   Okay, so what is carbon 70?
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.040]   Well, it's basically a molecule of carbon, also a form of carbon.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.440]   It's an alatropic carbon that has 70 carbon atoms in a cage-like structure, sort of like
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.680]   an oblong sphere.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.960]   It's very similar to the C60 molecule, but it just simply has 10 additional atoms.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.680]   And so here's an example of the multiple different allotropes of carbon, or most of
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.040]   them that is, where I want to point out that, you know, depending on how you arrange carbon
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.560]   atoms in nature, nature arranges that we don't, nature arranges carbon atoms in different
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.320]   ways, and those different ways create different substances.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.320]   And so you've got diamond, which is one of the hardest substances on Earth.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.920]   Simply a group of, you know, it's basically a group of carbon atoms.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.920]   Then you've got graphite.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.600]   Now, graphite is what we use in our pencils.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.520]   And the reason it works is because it's basically a layered type of molecular structure so that
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.960]   when you scrape your pencil across the paper, these sheets of carbon come off onto the paper,
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.520]   which is why it works.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.120]   There's also a form of carbon called Lon's Deliette.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.880]   And then, of course, our favorite, my favorite, I've done lots of videos on this one, which
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.000]   is carbon 60.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.360]   And then you've got this really complicated one, which is carbon 540, called a Fulerite.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.600]   And this thing has 540 carbon atoms, and it's also a caged-like structure.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.800]   And then the carbon 70 molecule.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.080]   And then, of course, you've got amorphous carbon, which is just a hodgepodge of carbon
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.080]   atoms.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.000]   And then you've got this really, really, really interesting one here called the single wall
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.080]   carbon nanotube.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.920]   Now, if you do any research in all and commercial application of carbon molecules, you'll know
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.840]   that diamonds are used, graphite is used.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.720]   You don't really hear much about these other ones, but carbon nanotubes is like the big
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.720]   thing now.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.160]   And also, too, if you take off one sheet of graphite, you have a form of carbon called
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.800]   graphine.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.760]   And that is also one of the real interesting carbon molecules that are being looked at
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.240]   for commercial purposes right now.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.080]   So it's really an interesting science, the science of carbon.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.880]   And what I wanted to share with you today is this guy right here, carbon 70.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.720]   So here's the thing.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.320]   I wanted to look into carbon 70, and I spent about, I'd say, good eight hours over the
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.280]   week, reading different studies, searching different websites like research gate and
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.320]   PubMed and you name it, looking for carbon 70 studies so that I could share with you what
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.320]   it does.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.120]   Because I'm more interested, not so much in the chemical or the, you know, the molecular
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.600]   properties of carbon, but I'm more so like, okay, from a health standpoint, as a supplement,
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.800]   like C60 is, what can C70 do?
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.600]   So I really spent a lot of time on looking at the biological application of carbon 70.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.160]   And what I found was, after eight hours of just searching and searching and reading and
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.080]   reading and reading, was there's not a lot of material.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.320]   I mean, there is not nowhere near.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.120]   You go look at carbon 60 and there are hundreds of science studies that have been done, and
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:17.520]   a lot of them have focused on what does carbon 60 do in vitro and in vivo, which means, you
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.840]   know, in the lab with living tissues, living cells, and also inside of critters that are
[00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.840]   alive and see what happens in the body kind of perspective.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.080]   And when I tried to do that with carbon 70, there really was almost nothing.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.080]   I mean, literally nothing.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.880]   And it just seems that in 86 when it was discovered because C60 is perfectly spherical, that,
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.560]   you know, every single industry looked at it and went, wow, what can we do with this?
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.000]   I mean, there's actually videos out there that talk about how C60 is like the, they
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.340]   call it the molecular ball bearing because you add that to anything in the industrial
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.340]   world.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.440]   It becomes, it just really makes it, it's literally carbon 60 is used as a industrial lubricant,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.080]   and it makes everything that you do in the industrial world better if you add carbon
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.080]   60 to it.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.240]   So the, and then of course, the medical field wouldn't look at it because it's a cage so
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.320]   it can capture other atomic because it's really small.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.560]   I mean, it's only 60 atoms, right?
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.920]   So it can capture other molecules and other atomic particles like hydrogen and helium
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.320]   and, and protons of different, of different chemicals.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.160]   And then it can deliver it because it's so small and it's, it passes through the blood
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.160]   brain barrier.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.160]   So that's C60.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.060]   So, so what happened, I think, is that C70 has been kind of overlooked because everyone's
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.440]   been focused on, on C60 for the last 30 years, and there hasn't been a lot of studies on
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.440]   C70.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.360]   In fact, I could not find any mammal studies on C70.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:47.640]   I could not find any, well, there's only, I found one in vitro, which is, you know, use,
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.840]   you know, put, you know, try it with a critter study, but I could not find anything other
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.840]   than that.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.960]   There's been no mice studies, no rat studies and so forth.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.040]   I mean, C60 has been studied to death when it comes to that aspect.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.960]   That's why there's a C60, you know, interest right now is because of the rat study, the
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.320]   2012 Paris rat study.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.600]   So, but there's nothing like that for C70.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.160]   So I just wanted to let you know that because I spent quite a few hours and reading a lot
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.160]   of stuff.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.160]   But here's the thing.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.320]   I did find four studies that I did want to share with you.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.680]   Of course, everything I'm talking about again is in the video description links.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.840]   Go ahead and read it yourself.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.080]   I do want to let you know that a lot of these studies, as if you, you know, if you've done
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.400]   this, you have to pay for this study.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.360]   You have to pay for the actual, you know, the whole study.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.520]   So a lot of them are just abstracts because I don't, I don't have the credentials to,
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.520]   to access the full study where I can access the full study.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.680]   I will provide you all of it, otherwise I'm taking my data from abstracts.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.440]   And then secondly, I'm not a, not a credential scientist.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.120]   So I just, you know, I just want you to know that.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.360]   And then also too, because we're only looking at four studies, I really want to preface
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.960]   it that, you know, is eight hours is four studies, you know, that's clearly not sufficient
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.160]   to get a clear definition of what carbon 70 can do.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.320]   And so, you know, be aware of that there, they're really, I mean, at the bottom line,
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.480]   the bottom line is that we need as, as a, as a, as a community.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.120]   We need a lot more study on carbon 70.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.200]   I mean, there is almost nothing.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.360]   And so in, in that's kind of why it's, it's just, I want to preface all of that because
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:26.200]   it is so new because everybody's been focused on C 60, the carbon 70's been kind of forgotten.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.240]   So I want to, but I, but I am interested in it.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.080]   So let's start with these studies.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.360]   Now the first study that I want to share with you is, as, as from the standpoint of what
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.680]   C 70 can do biologically there, I mean, there are a lot of studies on C 70 don't get me
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.240]   wrong, but they're all studies, you know, with chemists dinking around with, you know, the
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.520]   properties of C 70 and what it can do and what it can't do from a molecular and atomic
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.520]   standpoint.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.520]   But that's not what I'm focused on.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.000]   I'm focused on biological.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.440]   So now here's a study called carbon 70, carby for carboxy fullerenes as an effective antioxidants
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.640]   to protect sales against oxidative induced stress.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.840]   So that's kind of what I'm interested in C 60 is a super antioxidants.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.000]   So what is C 70?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.480]   What can it do the same?
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.880]   And so when they, when they take all of these different compounds and they have to basically
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.720]   dissolve them in different solutions, there's multiple different solutions that scientists
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.400]   use to dissolve things and then test them with other things.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.520]   And so carboxy fullerenes is using basically dimol, dimol, dimol, dimol, sorry, dimolonic
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.200]   acid and trimolonic acid.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:35.040]   And so here's the thing I want to point out, the when C 70, a trimolonic acid and dimolonic
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:45.440]   acid C 70 solution, okay, is used against these particular C to C 12 cells.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.760]   They exhibit a obviously protective effect against oxidative stress.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:56.400]   So that kind of answered the first question is does C 70 work as an antioxidant like C
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.560]   60, this study says yes, it does, it's obviously does.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:06.920]   And this is what's real interesting is you pick up on this, it says the study says that
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:15.560]   at concentrations as low as in a 2.4, 2.5 micron, I'm sorry, micromoles.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:23.280]   Whereas C 60 carboxy fullerenes, blah, blah, blah, show a protective effect at relatively
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.000]   higher concentrations.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.680]   So what, and I just want to point that out because I'll be talking adding, adding all
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.160]   these little data points up.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:37.200]   What that means is that they both are antioxidants, but it takes more C 60 to do the same job
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.640]   as when they use C 70.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.040]   So the results here, the use of significantly low concentrations of C 70 carboxy fullerenes
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.880]   as an antioxidant agent will benefit the therapeutic approaches aimed at alleviating
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.880]   ROS, which is reactive oxygen species, where radical oxygen, or act radical ions in your
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.880]   body, induced injuries, such as muscle disorder and arthritis.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.400]   So interesting result there.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:07.000]   Another study that I found called structural effective mechanisms of C 70 carboxy fullerenes
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.560]   as effective sensitizers against cancer cells.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:17.640]   Now on this one, of course, the melanic acid again is used as a dissolving solution.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:23.840]   They found that the C 70 fullerenes are more effective than C 60 counterparts as photosynthesized
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.000]   and what photosynthesized are is a molecule that produces a chemical change and another
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.520]   molecule in a photochemical process.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.200]   So here you go again.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.960]   The first study says that C 70 actually works better.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.440]   It takes less C 70 to do the same as C 60.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.760]   And then here's another one, a second study that actually says it's more efficient than
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   C 60.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.800]   So now this, when I read this, I started getting really interesting.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:52.160]   I'm like, oh, wow, you know, C 70 does is a little bit better than C 60 in at least two
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   studies.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.560]   It's not a third study.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.400]   And you know, it's like again, it was very hard to find stuff that actually where they
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.120]   actually tested C 70, most of the, you know, focus again, it's on six 60.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.400]   So, and so here's one where the study is called protective effective C 70 carboxy fullerenes
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.640]   against oxidative induced stress on post mitotic muscle cells.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.160]   So they took muscle cells, put them in a petri, right?
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.560]   And then they are whatever and they basically subjected them to C 70.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:27.240]   And in this study, we find that quadri, quadri melonic acid C 70 fullerene exhibits higher
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:34.240]   capability on protecting cells from an oxidative induced stress among these tested carboxy fullerenes.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:44.360]   So here you go again, a third study that says C 70 worked better than C 70 other carboxy fullerenes,
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.360]   right?
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.360]   All right.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.360]   So very interesting.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.600]   But really, really perked my interest when I started reading study, then another study
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.240]   and then another study and they're all telling me C 70 works better than C 60.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.600]   That's interesting.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   But here you go.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.120]   I want to temper this with this other one that I discovered called in vivo evaluation
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:09.560]   of carby carbon fullerene toxicity using embryonic zebrafish.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:15.000]   In fact, this study is the only one I found where they actually used it on a critter.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.800]   You know, not a critter critter, but an embryo critter.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.800]   And this is the thing.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.280]   If you read the abstract, and of course you can click on the link in the description,
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:29.400]   but it only has this one little sentence in here where they were testing C 60, C 70,
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:35.680]   and a hydroxylated C 60 with 24 oxygen and hydrogen atoms attached to the molecule around
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.680]   the C 60.
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.440]   So it's kind of like a mutated form of C 60, but in a pronounced way.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:48.080]   So anyway, they mentioned here in the abstract that when they exposed the embryonic zebrafish
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.240]   and the whole study was about, can we use zebrafish?
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.840]   Is zebrafish a good way to measure toxicity on fullerenes?
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.840]   Okay.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.840]   That was their purpose.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.840]   And they said, okay, so they go here.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.240]   We exposed it with C 60 and C 70.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.080]   So they exposed the embryonic embryonic zebrafish.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.160]   And this is what happened.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:10.960]   It induced a significant increase in malformations, pericardial and dima and mortality.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.720]   And then it goes on to talk about what happened when they used the other form of C 60.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.720]   So here you go.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:19.580]   You've got eight hours of study, multiple different sites.
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.280]   And this is the best I could find on, I would say my first pass.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:30.520]   And that is three studies that says C 70 is more powerful as an antioxidant than C 60,
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.720]   which is amazing just by itself.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.200]   And then one that says, hey, you know, when we pumped it into an embryo, embryo didn't
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   do that well.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.120]   It kind of was bad for it.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:44.960]   So, you know, it is these, like I always say, you know, data is neither good nor bad.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.480]   There's just results.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.720]   And so these are the results.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.800]   And so now we have four data points, three or positive, one is negative.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.520]   So then you say to yourself, well, now what, what do we, you know, okay.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:02.360]   And so at this point, I want to reiterate again that there have been no animal trials.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.920]   I mean, there's very, I mean, there's not even like an animal.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.400]   There's not even a trial on like plants.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.960]   And so anything that you do with carbon 70 or any other research is we're going to need
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.960]   a lot more research.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.160]   So if any of you scientists out there ever see this, please, you know, go check this
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.160]   out.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.260]   I mean, it's, there's this little, little, you know, like where you see smoke, there's
[00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.720]   fire, there's, there's, there's inkling here that says C 70 could actually be better than
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.720]   C 60.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.120]   And that would be amazing because C 60 is unbelievable.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.040]   So please go out there and go do those studies and get out there and bring more data.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.200]   And for you guys that playing at home, you know, C 70, I mean, there's an opportunity,
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.120]   there's a possibility, there's just so much we can learn because it's so new.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.600]   I mean, you got to realize that, you know, the rat study came out in 2012.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.600]   It's 2018.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.880]   It's only been six years since the rat study.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.960]   And the rat study was the one study that said, Hey, this thing's not toxic.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.720]   And in fact, it's good for you.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   And that was C 60.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.320]   I mean, no one's even tried to figure that out for C 70 yet.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:04.120]   So anything that you do from this point forward regarding C 70, you know, it's for research
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.480]   purely for research, there's nothing we can base it on.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.280]   There's no mice or rat study.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   So if you're going to do something, proceed at your own risk.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.680]   So with that said, and if you've been watching my videos, you know where I'm going because
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.280]   hey, guess what?
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.200]   Let's talk about C 70 olive oil.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.160]   Can you make a C 70 olive oil?
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.520]   And the answer is absolutely.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.680]   Of course you can.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.920]   Now this is what's interesting.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:35.120]   Red Lion is actually the first, you know, company that has put out a C 70 olive oil solution
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.120]   for sale.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.360]   It's a commercial product.
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.360]   It's not there.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.040]   It's not available anywhere else in the world.
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.040]   They put this out.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:47.680]   It came out about less than a month ago, which sparked my interest in C 70.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.780]   And so then it's so they it's actually available if you wanted to try it.
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:58.140]   And you know, for your own personal research as you 200 pound rats out there, it's available
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.140]   now.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.140]   Someone actually made one.
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.220]   And they also proved one.
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.220]   They proved two things.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.620]   One, you could make it and prove and then they prove that somebody is crazy enough to
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.620]   do it.
[00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:07.980]   So, so here's here you go.
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.780]   Now this is what carbon C 60 olive oil.
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.420]   This is from Red Lion.
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.580]   The olive oil with C 60 in it is this beautiful red.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.860]   That's why they call it, you know, the company Red Lion Biomedical Services.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.340]   And this red color is this beautiful crimson you've seen my videos.
[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.940]   This is like C 60 perfection.
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:30.420]   And then the most interesting thing when I opened up the bottle, I was actually lucky
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.460]   enough to be one of the first ones to receive this product.
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.660]   And I've been I'm on day two of it.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.620]   I've been this is when I opened the bottle.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:47.180]   Carbon 70 has the color of blood of human blood and it is an amazing color.
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.380]   And it's it's just kind of weird.
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:55.060]   I mean, from the standpoint of its blood, you know, and so it really the more I look
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.060]   into C 70, the more interested I am, but but these are the two different colors of the
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.860]   two different oils.
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.820]   And this is the bottle that it comes in.
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.820]   And so now because I couldn't find a lot of research, I approached Red Lion.
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.100]   We started doing some chatting on direct messaging yesterday.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.380]   So and this is I started asking questions.
[00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:17.300]   You know, could you please explain a little bit more because the content on the website
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:21.860]   is is is not as you know, not as clear as the information he gave me in his direct messaging.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:26.340]   So I wanted to share that with you because they, of course, have made this product.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.220]   It's the first one out there.
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:33.180]   And this is what they had to say because they did their research on it is that from this
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.500]   era, I direct quotes from Red Lion that C 70 is a detox, but in another way, it will
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.220]   not remove free radicals, but it gives so much energy, it will be like a detox.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.380]   For example, a pregnant woman will look glowing and full of health.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:50.660]   It's not a detox, but healthy and so much energy, the body will live longer and healthier because
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:51.660]   of it.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:58.060]   So I would say C 70 is female as in female energy and C 60 is male and both operate as
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:02.740]   usual in their own spheres in their own in their own way.
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:07.380]   So the Red Lion went on to say that one operates and gives so much energy.
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.820]   The body becomes healthy despite any toxins.
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.820]   The other purifies the body and the body has more energy because there are no toxins to
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:14.820]   fight.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.900]   So to speak, C 60 won't give the body energy, energy felt from C 60 is merely a consequence
[00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:25.820]   of its actions, but C 70 won't detox the body but will give it energy to fight disease.
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:30.580]   So the two in tandem, if one uses both of them, then one is using the female and male
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:37.020]   principles to make the body healthy, not simply the male electric side, which is very interesting.
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:43.020]   And then lastly, see Red Lion shared with me the one thing I forgot to mention is a strong
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.780]   central desire effect and a Viagra doesn't create desire.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.540]   It operates on blood vessels.
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.040]   But if there is no central desire, then Viagra will not work.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.500]   But pulverized C 60 does bring the actual central desires.
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:02.240]   So I said the new product would be infused with qualities, well central desire and all
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.820]   the weird mental abilities you that's me experience when I when you got piece pulverized
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.900]   C 60 on my hands are qualities, characteristics and abilities, which is really another way
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.460]   of saying frequencies, not energy or matter.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:21.780]   So it is so hard is so is it so hard to believe there are other spiritual energies with different
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:28.100]   qualities which can be manipulated and into C 60 olive oil, C 60 will give a very masculine
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.060]   central or sexual desire.
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.060]   And that's been proven.
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.540]   It's a really good for your libido.
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:39.780]   Whereas then C 70 or does the same thing for women, but in a more romantic way.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.540]   So that is fascinating because, you know, I didn't expect to hear that and I thought
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.340]   that was really amazing.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:50.100]   By the way, Norman smelled it and he approves of C 70 oil.
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:58.420]   So that's what I've been able to conclude for C 70 from science studies and from what
[00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.980]   red line has told me.
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:05.300]   I got my bottle two days ago for those of you on Twitter, you know, and this was me
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.660]   taking my second dose.
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.220]   So I've taken it for two days now.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.900]   I take it along with the C 60 and the only thing I mean, it's only two days.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.260]   So, you know, commenting on how it feels and how I feel would be a little silly.
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:23.660]   But I will tell you that because I'm on C 60, I take it in the morning and then I wait.
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.740]   Oh, yeah, because like right here is a caution that red line shared with me.
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:33.780]   It's super important that no vessels which contain C 60 are used with C 70 because fire
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.500]   will destroy the nature of C 60.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.060]   So it's kind of like it's really weird.
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:44.140]   I mean, when I took all of this to basically to say there's a yin in the yang, right?
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:48.180]   And then I would say that, you know, I'm cheese, I always forget which one's female.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.140]   I think it's the yin is the female and the yang is the male, I think.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.180]   But you know, that's what I'm seeing here.
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:57.460]   It's there's a C 60 and a C 70, a yin and a yang male and a female.
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.300]   And so what's really funny is you don't put them in the same vessel because they'll destroy
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.300]   each other.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.060]   Well, isn't that the truth?
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.060]   And so then I asked him.
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.540]   So I asked him, I'm like, Oh, Jesus, I mean, should I, you know, what happens if I take
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.540]   them together?
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.940]   So obviously you don't want to take them at the same time, but but specifically though,
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:20.180]   red line said, Oh, yeah, you can take them, you know, simultaneously, I mean, like, you
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.900]   know, you put them in your body, but, you know, but don't take them like in the same
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.900]   mouthful.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.460]   So I am taking C 60 and I'm taking C 70.
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.420]   And after two days, I can tell you that every time I take the C 70, it's kind of like
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.380]   I get a boost, you know, you're ready to get a boost from C 60.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.860]   For those you guys know, you take it, you know, you get this big energy boost because
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.700]   of the electron donate donators.
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:47.780]   But when I take the C 70 on top of it a couple hours later, it's like, it's like this shot
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.660]   of energies like just I just get this real shot of energy.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.580]   As far as any detox systems, symptoms or anything like that, I haven't haven't really
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.580]   experienced anything yet.
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:22:01.460]   It's very early in the in the in the program in my regime of taking C 70 with C 60.
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.140]   So I'll have a lot more to report on that as we go along.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:08.940]   In fact, I think other than the people at Red Lion, I'm probably the human trial for
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.940]   this.
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.660]   So if any of you're interested in joining, you know where to go.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:18.340]   So, so we'll be testing out C 70 and I will be letting you know and I'm very fascinated
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.780]   and this is real interesting stuff.
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:22.660]   So now what this slide talks about is making your own.
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:27.140]   So obviously you can go and buy it if you want to buy it, you know, where red line is,
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.580]   but can you make it your own?
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.580]   Obviously, yes, you can.
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.420]   You can totally make it yourself.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:36.740]   Now, I did ask Red Lion, are they using are they pulverizing their 70 and they're saying,
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.500]   no, they're not pulverizing it.
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.500]   So they're doing it.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.420]   So that would be like, you know, going out and get the powder, follow the standard one
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:49.420]   to one formula, which is one gram per one liter of oil.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:55.540]   There's very specific about using corn, neki oil and olive oil, that is.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.540]   And then of course, you know, because you're using powder, the process is very simple.
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:06.540]   Add the powder to the oil stir two weeks, then filter at 0.22 micrometers filter.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.540]   And that's it.
[00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.860]   And then you've got your beautiful C 70 oil.
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.700]   The issue here, and this is the big thing that just kind of shocked me because I had
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:19.060]   not looked at it before, but C 70 powder is really expensive.
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:25.900]   I mean, right now, if you go to like Red Lion's site and you buy like the cheapest you can
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:31.820]   get C 60 is like $58.77 a gram.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.140]   I mean, it's that cheap, if you buy the 10 gram bottle.
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.140]   Okay.
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:43.260]   Now, if I go to like SES researcher, MTR, which is materials technology research, those guys,
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:49.420]   you can get C 60 if you buy the big bottles as, you know, pretty low, like $89, $90 or
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.620]   less, a gram.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:56.980]   Now, if you just buy one gram, you know, obviously it's about 130, 150, but you know, the more
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.100]   you buy the cheaper gets.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:03.020]   But so if you take the idea that it's like, Oh, you know, if I can get C 60 for 59 bucks
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.780]   a gram, look at the price.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.020]   I mean, of C 70, I mean, you can't, I can't even imagine buying more than one gram.
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:17.860]   If one gram at SES costs $375 and over at MTR, one gram of C 70 is $310.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:24.540]   That's five times, five times more expensive than C 60 and it's just unbelievable because
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.180]   it's that hard to synthesize.
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:31.060]   And of course, and then from a purity standpoint, the best purity I can find anywhere that provides
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.380]   this carbon fullerenes is 99.0.
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.380]   So they're happening.
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.660]   I mean, there hasn't even been a way for anyone to get past 99.0.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.700]   It's that difficult to synthesize and therefore that much more expensive.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:48.860]   So anyone that's going to think about doing carbon 70 oil, it's a very expensive thing.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.220]   And that's why I just went and bought the bottle, you know, instead of try to make it
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.220]   at home.
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:59.060]   I may or may not depends on what happens as I take it because it has female energy.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:06.180]   I'm hoping that it tempers with male energy and I don't get all weepy or anything.
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:07.180]   So that's not it.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.180]   That's not it.
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.180]   And so I'm just kidding.
[00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.180]   Okay, so, but that's really it.
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.180]   You can make it at home.
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:16.220]   It's super expensive and make sure you don't let C 60 stuff touch your C 70 stuff.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:17.220]   And that's it folks.
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.340]   That's what I've learned on C 70.
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.020]   It's an amazing thing.
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.460]   It's like a there's a lot to learn.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.460]   That's really it.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.340]   There's a lot to learn about carbon 70.
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:31.620]   It has it shows that it has the possibility of incredible potential being better than
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:32.820]   C 60.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.860]   You can actually go out and buy it, you know, now, which is, which is like that's never
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.420]   happened before.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.500]   And or you can go make it and it's really expensive and that's really it.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.020]   So thank you.
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.180]   Thank you for stopping by.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.380]   Thank you for watching this video.

[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.820]   know that I appreciate your comments.
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.820]   I appreciate you.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.460]   I appreciate your time.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.140]   And thank you and have a great day Aloha.
