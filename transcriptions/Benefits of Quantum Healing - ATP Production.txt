[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.480]   Kay Elmer and this video is a further installment in the series "Benefits of Quantum Healing"
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.560]   where I've been documenting the results of studies that have been commissioned by Layla
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.440]   Quantum Tech on the effects of quantum energy has on various biological systems.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.280]   This video covers a study produced in 2023 on the effects of quantum energy as it has
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:30.960]   on human cell ATP production. Now most people and myself included, I have no idea what is ATP,
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.120]   so let's just start with that. What is ATP? Well it turns out that it is the metabolic process
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.840]   within every cell that exists in our bodies, in plants, any animals, everything living that has
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.600]   cells has to have a metabolic process by which it converts food into energy and that's really
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.160]   what it comes down to. Now it is really important and what does it do for our bodies? I'll have a
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.360]   little I found this little clip I wanted to share kind of explain why and how it's so important.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.920]   At this very moment trillions of energy releases are happening all throughout your body contributing
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:13.280]   to a variety of functions including body temperature. ATP or adenosine triphosphate is commonly referred
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.000]   to as the energy currency of the body. It's created through aerobic and anaerobic respiration as well
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.600]   as fermentation inside the cells of the body. It's made up of three phosphates attached to a ribose
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.440]   and an adenine and when one of those phosphates is hydrolyzed it releases energy capable of moving
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.120]   proteins. Without it just as an economy without a meaningful way to exchange value everything comes
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.920]   to a grinding hole. So now with that said the most interesting thing about this study was the
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.480]   company Leila Quantum Tech had commissioned a professor I'll explain who the principal
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:58.080]   investigator is in a second but they commissioned a scientist to study on a whim you know like hey
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.400]   does quantum energy actually do anything to the very base process of our cellular functions and
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.320]   you know it's this crazy question to ask but they decided to ask that so the synopsis of this study
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.760]   it is available on the Leila Quantum Tech and the quantum upgrade website look under research
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.800]   if you want to get a copy of the study but the general synopsis of the report it was to describe
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.520]   the results of three initial experiments that analyzing quantum or field effects on cellular ATP
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.040]   levels. ATP was selected as the biological readout because it is the energy currency of the cell
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.160]   playing an essential role in all aspects of cell function activity and overall health as explained
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.160]   so that's what they chose and they wanted to see hey does quantum energy affect that
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.600]   because it's the very basis of life as we know it and how it functions and how we move around.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.400]   So the principal investigator and this is really important because this is a scientist
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.080]   his name is Dr. Robert Joseph's Chief this is completely a third-party independent study that
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.520]   was commissioned by Leila the company did not have any control over the study it was done by Dr.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.720]   Chief at the University of Tulsa now he's an Associate Professor of Biochemistry at the University of
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.240]   Tulsa his research focuses on discovering and characterizing novel therapeutic drugs from synthetic
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.160]   libraries and natural products his areas of expertise are cancer biology cell metabolism cell cycle
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.640]   chemotherapeutics and drug screening so this is a gentleman who has decades of experience in
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.840]   working with human cells and studying them and so that's why he was selected and agreed to help
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.040]   do the study so now what the study does and this is the report that you'll you can read on the website
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.600]   the methods and materials was simply this the number of experiments was done it was repeated
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.640]   three separate times and if you read the report Dr. Chief was trying to eliminate every possible
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.840]   variance by which ATP production would be modified based on the types of of cells used based on the
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.280]   length of time in the incubator the temperature of the incubator I mean all of these incredible
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.720]   finite details are in the in the report in which he was tweaking all of the various variables to
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.720]   make sure that you know as he's measuring the changes in ATP from one experiment to another
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.320]   he's tweaking all the little variables to try it every you know three different ways
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.840]   to make sure that the results are consistent over over the overall study so he did it three
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.120]   separate ways for on purpose and the details of each different way is documented in the report
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.160]   it's very detailed now the material study again were human cells and he used different human cells
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.040]   depending on different which different experiment that he ran but the idea of those you know human
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.040]   cell is a human cell and it all of the cells generate ATP now or the microchonderea but listen
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.880]   I get into the biochemistry now the process that he did was he would make 10 cell cultures the
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.200]   identical cell cultures and those little petri dishes you know that you're all familiar with
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.560]   and so now you'd separate into two groups of five so there'd be five petri dishes and you know one
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.080]   group five and the other he labeled them A and B and then there was a third-party colleague
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.720]   because this was all done completely double blind so he would hand all 10 plates to his colleague who
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:18.880]   would then expose one group of five plates to quantum energy via the quantum upgrade service
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.760]   and then the other ones would not be exposed to quantum upgrade so he had one control group
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.160]   that was that was completely left normal didn't do anything with it and he had the other control
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.280]   group of five plates that were exposed to quantum energy and it was again it was double blind the
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:40.080]   doctor's chief was not made aware or at any time knew which group when he then would study the results
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.920]   and and measure the ATP of the different groups he had no idea which ones were exposed to which
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.640]   were not he would just collect the data and then the data was then analyzed to determine hey you
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:57.440]   know what quantum energy does make an effect now the length of exposure of quantum energy on the
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.240]   plates that were exposed was less than five minutes now he states in his report that he would hand
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.080]   the place to his colleague and the colleague would literally come back in in five minutes so it was
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.840]   under five minutes that that the quantum upgrade service was running on these little plates okay
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.680]   now it was energy only for those of you using quantum upgrade you know you can have it energy
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.520]   only or you could have energy and frequency and this study was done with just quantum
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.480]   upgrade energy well there was no frequencies used just as an FYI now in terms of the measurements
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.520]   once doctor she's got this got the 10 plates back he would put them in the incubator then
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.880]   pull them out and then he would measure it at the 10 minute mark one hour mark two hour mark three
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.120]   hour mark and 10 hours and he would measure it five separate times to see what the you know what the
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.240]   amount of ATP that would come out of the cells if any and how it looked over time and you know
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.640]   when it would diminish and stop doing that so the overall results are really fascinating which was
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:58.160]   number one the first experiment he comments that ATP levels are already higher in the treated sample
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.960]   after 10 minutes and remained higher for at least two hours by three hours ATP levels are back to
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.720]   the levels of the untreated group which is the control group suggesting the transient increase
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.760]   is real so that's amazing so just keep in mind you know if for those of you who subscribe to
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.400]   quantum upgrade or you are you know you have a block or a capsule that your exposure to quantum
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.920]   energy just a little just a little bit like like less than five minutes is going to boost your ATP
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.640]   for at least two hours so you know it's it is a is a real interesting finding now the second one
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:36.000]   where there was a different type of human cells that were used in the study in experiment number two
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.920]   the results were that the ATP levels are qualitatively consistent with experiment one
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:48.080]   showing a transient increase in ATP levels in the cells exposed to quantum effect however and
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:54.000]   this is another interesting find of the study the effect does not seem to persistent as long as
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.920]   in experiment two so in other words that it was different than the first one it didn't last as long
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.080]   as there was a bit more scatter in some of the data sets now the data with which these other
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.160]   cells that he had used which was ADF cells does not show an increase in ATP levels of the treated
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:16.400]   cells in some cases ATP levels actually decreased in the treated cell set so what is and what and
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.920]   this is what he stated in his report that it was unclear why quantum effect might be cell type
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.920]   specific or have opposite effects so experiment two was was fascinating because he wanted to try
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.880]   a different way and he actually got different results ATP did go up and some types of cells
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.520]   that literally went down or didn't happen at all so that's important to note but the third time he
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.000]   did it which he wanted to do he actually tweaked it in a certain way where he mentions something
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.640]   called the spool overall mention i'll cover that in a second but again he repeated the experiment
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:53.440]   or tweaked some of the variables and on the third time he did this test once again he states in the
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:00.320]   report a transient but statistically significant increase in ATP levels was observed in the treated
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.920]   cells so you know basically he did it three times two out of three times he had similar results
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.960]   one of the three times they were varied however it they still the ATP levels still did go up
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.920]   now the overall summary of the report as written in the report is right there is for experiment
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.640]   number three the clients removed this spillover effect that happened in experiment one and two
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.600]   of the charge cells to the non-charge cells if that is the case it makes sense why the first
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:33.280]   experiments only showed up to an 8 increase in ATP it's still significant versus the 20 to 25 percent
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.120]   in the third experiment in which the non-charge cells were truly non-charge and so what so what
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:46.480]   they discovered after the first two tests of the experiments there was some kind of when the when
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.160]   the colleague would take the the plate of 10 you know trays and each separate out the five plates
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.560]   that there was some kind of a spillover effect and they suspected that the control group may have
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:04.560]   somehow being in the same room right uh you know been exposed to quantum energy and that's why they
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.160]   they felt that when they compared the two to see what the delta was from one to the other it was
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:15.120]   lower than the third one when they apparently from it's not discussed it's not written in the
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.600]   report want to make that clear this is my assumption but apparently in the third experiment they did not
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.600]   bring the other five they left the five somewhere else and the and you know the five to be exposed
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.160]   and the colleague only took the five to expose it and they kept them really far away from each
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.440]   other so there was no quote spillover effect so that's kind of what my assumption is because
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.040]   there's no definition in the report of the of what he means by spillover effect i'm just assuming
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.200]   based on just you know the overall process of the experiment now the last thing i want to really
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:55.280]   recommend i mean uh uh mention sorry is that this right here this 20 to 25 percent increase in ATP
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:04.480]   is unbelievable okay and so the comment that was uh no the report was then reviewed and and basically
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:11.040]   the peer review of the paper was done by Ian Mitchell who's the lead Leila scientific advisor
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.320]   for that company and he's a reputable incredible scientist all on his own so he peer reviewed this
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:22.480]   and basically he stated in his overview his cover letter of the report that an increase in cellular
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:29.840]   output in excess of 20 over baseline allows a person to have more resources at their disposal
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:37.920]   biologically across all domains it can be better it can better people help heal okay that's exactly
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.640]   that's that's i'm sorry i just cut and paste right out of the report so that's like i thought i read
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:49.600]   this book okay so but it can help people heal from injuries stave off diseases allow for battle
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:58.240]   sorry better mental processing and greatly enhance athletic performance it is a big deal and even
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:06.640]   bigger deal was that the quantum upgrade headquarters is like was over 500 miles away from the university
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:12.080]   of Tulsa where the studies were done you know there was no direct you know connection at all
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:19.920]   so it is it is not only the fact that you know ATP went up is astounding that quantum entanglement
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.920]   actually had an effect and the third thing was is that getting that level of ATP increase
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.760]   and what it does to your body is just you know it's amazing and the last thing was was you know
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:37.360]   we're talking about the way your body processes food uh you know and so like it's so it's where
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.680]   to you know we like in other words where did all this energy come from uh that was put into the
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.880]   you know into the cycle then it produced this ATP you know it is really mind-boggling that this
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:53.280]   report and this study demonstrated that that actually really is happening it was done by
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.640]   reputable scientists peer reviewed by another reputable science double blind and all of that so
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:04.640]   this is a remarkable study on the effects of quantum energy on on cells and the whole issue
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:10.960]   behind ATP production is that it drives everything else in our body i mean it handles everything
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:16.400]   from cellular repair to again as i and mitchell states in his statements it helps you heal
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.680]   staves off diseases a better mental processing and greatly enhances athletic performance so this
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.880]   is an amazing finding from this study again you can get the copy of the study on the layla q
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.240]   website or the quantum upgrade just go under the area of research and that's it so another
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.280]   amazing study by layla quantum tech thank you very much for watching and i just want to say if you
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.600]   want to learn more you can go to quantum upgrade.io this was the service i was used for the study
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.160]   and you can find me at the tinker's academy links below in the video description to my blog
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.200]   and i just if you'd like this type of content and or you want to follow this video series i have a
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.520]   playlist on my youtube channel called benefits of quantum healing it lists all of the different
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:00.480]   videos that have been done on all of the different studies i do these videos as the studies come out
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:06.480]   or as they become available to me just to basically share and create a video of a multi-page document
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.960]   that most people are not going to have any interest in reading and i feel that the video format is
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.600]   a much more you know digestible form so if you like this you want to follow the series please
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.080]   subscribe and to my youtube channel and this is where you're going to find them otherwise i
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.560]   just want to say thank you so much for interested if you're in you know for your interest in quantum
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.760]   energy and layla quantum tech and thank you for watching my videos have a great day aloha
