[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Aloha, everyone. Welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   your host, Cammer. And this video is another installment in the
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.920]   video FAQ series. Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.560]   Quantum Tech, and quantum upgrade. Now, this is where we're
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.560]   plucking questions that are frequently asked in the the
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.840]   telegram chat groups. And I'm basically either I'm asked
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.920]   answering the questions or I'm asking Philip von Holzendorf,
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.600]   the owner operator of Layla Quantum Tech, what his take is on
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.960]   some of these questions that pop up frequently. So this question
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.360]   right now is on how to use quantum upgrade or lay the quantum
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:40.000]   tech to help people and pets pass on when they leave this
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.440]   planet. So here's what Philip had to say. What is your take on
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.160]   on when people are working with people or pets? And they're
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.520]   ready to pass on. And in how would you like use quantum
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.280]   upgrade or if you have a block to help that person at that
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.400]   moment, you know, like, you're no longer trying to prolong,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.920]   right? But the question is, is like, you know, what what would
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.040]   be the best approach while they're doing it? And should I
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.280]   keep the subscription going for them for maybe a few more
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.600]   weeks? You know, like, what are your thoughts on that for
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.960]   helping people and pets pass on?
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.920]   Yeah, I mean, I would definitely keep the quantum upgrade on or
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.240]   if people have, you know, a block just leveraged that I would
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.720]   still give them the cleanest food I could give them. And the
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.480]   cleanest energy. Because, you know, what happens to our
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.560]   brains and to our blood and all of that is something that
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.480]   happens to the animals as well. And even if they're ready to
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.440]   move on, because of whatever reason, right, why not provide
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.160]   them at least the the most amazing environment, impossible
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.440]   energetically, and then obviously, in regards to us being
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.600]   present as humans in that process, there's not much more to
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.360]   say I would not overdo it, I would not underdo it, I would
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.160]   just keep nice levels and and check in what is the best
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.200]   frequency for that, right? Is it now in between maybe a
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.080]   happiness frequency, or is it maybe the brain needs something
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.160]   just always check in. And that's how I would approach it. Okay.
