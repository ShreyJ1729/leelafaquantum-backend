[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host, Kalmer. Now this
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:11.040]   video is for folks out there in the world who have a block from Leila Quantum Tech. It's whether
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.000]   you have any one of the four different blocks that they sell. And so now I've had mine for over three
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.320]   years. Now I've started with the first one that the actual quantum block right here. And then I've
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.840]   gone on and I've actually acquired all of them. So I've over that time, you know, I've been doing a
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.880]   lot of tinkering around with them and of course, you know, and also helping fill up with the tutorials.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.720]   And so I've covered a lot of stuff. And we've covered a lot of stuff that, you know, you could
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.120]   do with them that could really kind of bring, you know, more health, more energy, more healing,
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.040]   more wellness, more harmony, all that cool, great stuff that this stuff does into your home and into
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.320]   your life. And so I wanted to share with you some other ideas you may not have thought about from
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.120]   the standard set of ideas that we've covered up so far. So this video is for you block owners.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.760]   So let's jump right in now. So this is the stuff that we've talked about so far. If you had a chance
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.160]   to kind of, you know, review the tutorials and hang out in the Telegram chat group,
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.360]   you know that, you know, one of the best things you could put in the block is you,
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.120]   you know, and it's just really, really awesome to put yourself in the block. And also, you know,
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.440]   your pets, you can put photos of people of things, places and things like that.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.200]   Cover that in depth in the last video I did on, you know, I think it was the five top things or
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.840]   something you could do with lately stuff. But also too, you know, you can charge your water,
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.520]   your food. These are all things that I do all the time, of course, wine and spirits.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.600]   I mean, if you haven't tried putting wine in a block yet, you got to give that a try.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.880]   Holiday season is coming up. You know, jewelry, keys, you know, all that kind of stuff. And then
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.840]   intentions. I covered intentions in a recent video as well, talking about, you know, how to use
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.600]   the blocks to manifest intention, you know, because one of the things that, and I think the thing that
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.640]   these blocks do is, you know, working with the quantum field, but they actually
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:04.320]   can amplify and then broadcast out whatever you put in that block. And so there's a lot of
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.920]   things you could put in the block. And I wanted to share with you more things you could do you
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.080]   probably hadn't thought about so far. So right here on this slide is just the basic stuff that
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.160]   we've covered before. And then, you know, everyone's encouraged, you know, you know, it's a heck of
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.720]   an investment. So why not just make the most of it and kind of tinker around with it. And then I
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.720]   just grabbed this photo. It's one of my favorite photos that somebody posted on the telegram chat
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.560]   group, a little puppy here waiting for its dog. It's a little toy to finish charging in an infinity
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.960]   block. And that's just one example of the many things you could do with your block to just put
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.000]   some of that, you know, that pure quantum positive life force energy into all sorts of different
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.840]   things. So let's jump right into now what else can you do with your quantum blocks. So one of the
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.280]   first things I wanted to kind of talk about is bio geometry. Now, the concept of bio geometry
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.400]   was kind of created by Ibrahim Karim. Many, many, many years ago, he wrote a couple of books so far
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.600]   back to a future for mankind called, you know, the books called bio geometry. And then he came out
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.400]   with another book called bio geometry signatures. And the whole idea now how you could use this
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.720]   towards health, healing, harmony, etc, is the idea here that that he's been basically kind of over
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.360]   45 years, but he started working with nature. And he found this incredible connection between,
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.480]   you know, symbols, you know, symbols, and how nature would work. And of course, we are part of
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.440]   nature. And so he's kind of gone on since that original beginnings with he's actually starting
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.560]   to understand. And he has created this incredible work, you know, and you could see a lot of the
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.520]   stuff that he's done. You can, you know, there's lots of videos on YouTube of being interviewed.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.080]   Of course, there's these books out there. And so the idea here, though, is that he's found kind of
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.960]   like the secret code of nature and through these little symbols and how they interact with with
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.360]   the quantum realm and all things that are living. And so with 45 years of research, what, you know,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.920]   Abraham Karim has kind of figured out is he's found these linear diagrams that help balance
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.840]   the subtle energy of body organs is one of the other aspects of his work is, you know, how it
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.920]   reacts with the body. Now, the organ subtle energy patterns are accessed through the
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.920]   bio geometry signatures placed externally in the body's energy fields to create a connection
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.120]   through resonance of shape. And you know, if you understand the Fibonacci sequence and the golden
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.960]   mean, there's a lot about universe. There's a lot about reality that, you know, academics haven't
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.640]   even started to touch on, but it's all connected. And there's like a code to it. And so he's kind
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.640]   of cracked that code through these shapes that he's kind of figured out and how they interact with
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.480]   us. And then he's gotten it down to like he's gotten specific shapes that he's found. 45 years of
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.280]   research, where not only can he help improve environments with these shapes, but you can now
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:08.080]   start helping to improve your body and your health with some of these shapes now. And so now this is
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.200]   a modern science of energy balancing. And it provides the key to a hidden ancient knowledge of
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.800]   great civilization. So it's, it's really kind of a new thing for people who aren't like familiar
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.280]   with this stuff. But it, you know, goes back decades. And it's really quite fascinating,
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.760]   especially if you listen to some of his work and him talk about things. So one of the things now
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.640]   you could do with your block as it relates to bio geometry is using these signatures and using
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.680]   these shapes. Now what you can do now, I just took a little page, you know, a snapshot of a page
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.160]   out of the book for signatures and kind of just give you an example here. But just as this is an
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.240]   example out of the book, but there's like car protection science, biosignatures, you know,
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.200]   things that could help your liver, asthma, rheumatism, all that kind of stuff. And so you can kind of see
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:58.000]   that these shapes, and it's a symbol, it's an ancient kind of like sacred symbol, right? Four
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.840]   specific areas of your body, like here's one for cancer, kidneys, and so forth. Now if you utilize
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.680]   these shapes, you could do it two ways. You can either draw it out and then put that in your block
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.160]   and set the intention that, you know, you know, you know, help me know my liver, you know, can get
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.800]   better or something like that. I mean, I'm always having hard time wording out off the top of my
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.560]   head, my intentions, but I might, you know, I would basically put an intention for your liver to heal
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.560]   and then put the shape in the block. And in that way, it sends that energy towards
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.040]   that specific organ. So, you know, that's one way to do it. The other way that I just recently
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.440]   did, and I did this as an experiment for like, I don't know, like it's been about a month and
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.200]   half, I think now, but a little while ago, I decided, Hey, you know what, I'll just get a piece of
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.000]   wire and I'll just wrap a piece of wire in the shape of this guy right here, this little live,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.520]   you know, this is kidney. Because I've had, I've had problems for several years with kidney stones,
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.120]   gotten a really good handle on it, but I was starting to feel a little bit sore in my kidney,
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.440]   my right kidney. So I decided, Hey, you know what, I'm going to go ahead and wrap a piece of wire
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.800]   in the shape of the kidney. And I put it in my grand block and charged it up, right? But I didn't
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.640]   leave it in the grand block. I actually made a pendant out of it. And I've been wearing this
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.800]   charged pendant for now for six weeks, and I swear the pain's gone. It's just, you know,
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.960]   it's kind of a weird thing, but you know, it actually works. So I just keep wearing the pendant every
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.600]   day. So you can either drop the shape on a piece of paper, put it in the block. And of course, you
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.760]   know, if it's in your house, you're in that field. And so that energy is going to you,
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.560]   or you can just, you know, take a piece of wire, make one of these shapes, and wear it as a pendant,
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.680]   put it in the block where it is a pendant. And, and honestly, that's one way to bring the, I guess,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:46.000]   you know, the, the power of bio geometry into your world, you know, through using your quantum
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.400]   block. So there's one idea for you that you probably hadn't tried. Now, another idea is this
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:56.720]   other concept from a guy named Lloyd Mears. And he wrote a book called Energy Balancing by
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:02.320]   Numbers. And so now over the last 20 years, Lord Mear, I mean, Lloyd Mear has developed a program
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:09.520]   of converting energetic frequencies into numerical sequences. You know, using his subconscious mind
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:15.520]   and with a dowsing rod built on years of experience with the work. And if you read up on people that
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.800]   are doing Lloyd Mear's numbers, you know, there's actually a lot of really positive testimonies out
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.760]   there about about how these numbers, you know, which is basically a frequency translated to a
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.320]   numerical sequence. Again, one of the mysteries of the universe, but somehow it's connected and
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.360]   somehow it works. And so with the help of his higher source, his method continues to generate
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.080]   new numbers and never a duplicate number, which is interesting. There's never a duplicate number
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.360]   when he's sitting there trying to dows that the right number that matches a frequency to a specific
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.120]   organ, malady, illness, disease, whatever, and all sorts of other things like prosperity and
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.840]   abundance. And you name it, there's all these things. There's 6000 numbers. And the book right
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:01.360]   here is called Energy Balancing by Numbers. And so now at this point, he's gotten over 6000
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:06.720]   different numbers. And so if you go to his website and where he sells his book, you can go ahead
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.720]   and here's just an up page, you know, example page. But here's one for eliminate, you know,
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:18.880]   eliminating inflammation. And that number is 67875987397, you know. And so what you do with that, and
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.240]   this is what I've done to as well, you write the number down, and you put that in your block and
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:29.200]   you put that into the field. And then of course, the quantum magic that it does is it takes the
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.960]   energy of that frequency that it's a frequency converted to a number, and then broadcast it
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:40.480]   into your field that you live in, right? And or you could, you know, you could put your, you know,
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.400]   if you're doing yourself, you could put the number in at the same time. But just writing down these
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:50.160]   numbers that are all associated with 6000 different things that you could, you know, like if you're
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:54.960]   interested in whatever it might be, you know, there's all sorts of different ones or stuff for,
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:01.120]   you know, cancer, and you name it. I mean, in this, in his list of numbers, and then writing down
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.040]   that number and just simply putting it in your block and putting that frequency, you know,
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.480]   that intention into the field is one other way you could use your block by using energy numbers
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:16.640]   by Lloyd Meers. Now, there's another guy out there, and this guy, he uses radionic. And so you've got
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.480]   Meers doing dowsing, you know, connecting with his higher self. And then you've got his Russian
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.600]   psychic. And he does radionics, and that's a whole nother subject, but it's, it's tied into
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.560]   that whole mystery of the universe thing, right? In terms of like, how do you, you know, how do you
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:38.080]   kind of find those hidden codes, those secret codes of how, you know, our reality works? And so
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:44.720]   what he's done is through radionics, you know, he's found different numbers himself that tie to
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.560]   different different, you know, health ailments. And so they were developed by this Russian psychic,
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:57.280]   Gogori Gabbavoy, using his radionic machine and he pinpointed numbers that associated with
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.560]   various health conditions. Then he's been working with people, you know, he's a psychic healer.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.680]   So he's been working with healers for patients for decades. And he instructs his clients to
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.640]   meditate on these numbers, resulting in this is these are his claims, miraculous recovery,
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.600]   such as regenerated uteruses, kidneys reversed again, and much more. And so there's a lot of
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:24.800]   real interesting stuff about, you know, Gogori Gabbavoy, as well as Lloyd Mears, that you could find out
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.040]   how these gentlemen are kind of like, you know, coming at the same concept from different angles
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.240]   had discovered the codes, right? These are codes like you've got up here, you've got, you know,
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:41.040]   Ibram, you know, Cahill with, I'm sorry, Ibram Karim has come up with signatures. He's found
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.000]   the signatures, the symbols, you know, the ancient symbols that are used for health, you know, health
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.600]   and healing, and then you've got other gentlemen men out there who've figured it out using numbers.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.600]   And so there's just different ways you could do it. So again, if you had a number, you could put
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.800]   right that down, you can use a Gabbavoy number or you could use a Lloyd Mears number and putting
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:06.800]   that into your block and then kind of manifesting that, how, you know, how that number or that symbol
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.800]   translates to a frequency and translates to health, harmony, all that stuff. So here's an example of
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:19.440]   like, you know, of Gabbavoy codes for like, you know, here's one for weight loss 4812412, right?
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.600]   That's getting you write that number down, put it in your block, and then you start manifesting
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:29.280]   weight loss. Now, again, one of the things about, I do want to point out that the biogenometry
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:34.080]   signatures are in the book. And by the way, the links to everything I'm talking about are in
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.080]   the video description. So if you want to link to the any of the books or any of the websites or
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.720]   anything I'm talking about, it's in the video description. Okay. So you can find the symbols
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:48.000]   here in this book, you could find the numbers here in this book, and you can also find the numbers
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.280]   basically for this guy. You know, what I did was I just Googled it. And there's been a whole
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.640]   bunch of folks, especially on Pinterest, who have basically kind of, you know, wrote all this stuff
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.880]   down. So you can kind of get a lot of them for free right off Pinterest. So just Google it,
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.960]   and you'll be able to find, you know, the numbers for, you know, what you're looking for if you have
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.040]   anything, any kind of interest and out. And so, you know, and that's gets kind of how it works. So
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.960]   if you wanted the number for something, go ahead and Google it. All right. Now, the other one that
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:20.000]   I want to kind of point out too, and this is, you know, the third idea, right, you've got symbols
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.560]   and numbers that you could put in your block. But here's one more thing you can put in your block.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.480]   And that's mantras. Now mantras are somewhat similar to intentions, right? So you can have
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.840]   a personal mantra that says, I constantly grow, I'm ready for challenge, right? That sort of thing.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.600]   You know, which are sort of like intentions, but a mantra is kind of the ancient, you know, I kind
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:46.400]   of, I had really, really, really dig ancient stuff. You know, I just feel like, you know, the
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:53.520]   ancients had a lot more understanding of nature in the universe than we do today. I think we're just,
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.840]   I think we're just literally rediscovering all that stuff. You know, it's coming back, right?
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.720]   Now that we're, you know, we've entered this new age of Aquarius. And however, the idea here is
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.720]   the, these are the ancient knowledge kind of stuff. And that's where mantras come in.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:13.200]   You know, a mantra or a mantra is a sacred utterance, a numinous sound, a syllable word,
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.720]   or phonems, phonemes, or groups of words in Sanskrit, Pali and other languages,
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:24.000]   believe by practitioners to have religious, magical, or spiritual powers. Some mantras have
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.440]   a synatic structure and literal meaning, while others do not. And so the idea here is, now you,
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:34.560]   again, you can Google all sorts of different mantras that, you know, it's really, you know,
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:40.400]   it's a really big thing in the yoga world. But it's something that you can also do by simply
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.840]   writing it down and putting it in your block. Now you, you also could be, you know, repeating the
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:51.040]   mantra while you're meditating and you've got your hands in the block. But there's ways to kind
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.360]   of interact and kind of like, because, you know, these quantum blocks, they amplify and they
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.480]   concentrate and then they broadcast these, you know, intentions and these, you know, whatever you're
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.800]   thinking, whatever you're, you're manifesting in your head is, is kind of come through that.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:10.400]   And that's how you would work with mantras is by simply writing them down and then meditating on
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.320]   them while you're using your block. And here's one last thing that I kind of want to point out,
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:20.560]   is one of the lately healer network, you know, healers is a guy named Agni Frank Aikerman.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:26.160]   And he has, you know, and you'll notice if you go, if you're hanging out on Telegram that every
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.960]   now and then Philip will post one of his, one of his mantras. Now he comes, if you subscribe to his,
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:37.360]   you know, his kind of like website, it's German, by the way, he puts out, I think he puts out like
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:43.120]   a weekly, you know, kind of like, you know, mantra that, you know, he wants his followers to kind of,
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:48.160]   you know, meditate on it and just to help them with whatever in the world is going on, you know,
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:55.600]   with, you know, health healing harmony. And so a few years ago during the Panini, he came up with this
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.560]   article that he posted on Facebook, link below in the video description. And basically he called it
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.800]   the new DNA and he talked about, you know, how, you know, we've been shifting for the last few
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:10.400]   years, we're shifting. And you could imagine how that's manifesting in our realities by so many
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:16.960]   people are waking up to their higher consciousness. If you have not noticed, it's really happening.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:22.800]   There's so many more people now that are starting to just raise up in vibration. And so this,
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.440]   because we've, we've moved, you know, our solar system has moved in the universe. And so the idea
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.920]   here is that he's kind of really came up with, and this is an example, just one more example of a
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:36.400]   mantra from one of the healers in the healer network, where basically he called it the new DNA and
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.520]   you know, what does it mean for us? And so he came up, he came up with a mantra for his followers
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:49.360]   during the panini. And just as an example, that it provided a mantra as a virus disconnector,
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:55.920]   you know, to prevent global infection. So the mantra is poshundru poshundru. And can be used as a
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.160]   meditation throughout the day, it does two things that tells the virus that are developed and no
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:05.680]   longer needs our support, it tells us that we should quickly focus on integrating the new DNA.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.880]   And what he means by new DNA is that with regardless of the panini, right, because there's been two
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.920]   things that have happened, but you know, like, you know, our, our, our race has has, you know,
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.880]   on the planet has shifted to the age of Aquarius. And we've all starting to, you know, really
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:25.680]   interact with that energy. And some of us are, are vibrating up higher and higher into, you know,
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:30.080]   like basically fourth and fifth dimensional beings. And you know, there's still a lot of folks that
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.840]   are stuck in three dimension, but the whole thing, and you know, it's manifested, obviously,
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:39.840]   through, I'm not manifested, but kind of communicated through the Hawkins scale. So if you're familiar
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:45.120]   with the Hawkins scale, you go up in vibration, you kind of go up in consciousness as well. And so
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:52.080]   the new DNA is that we literally are evolving as light beings with, with this energy that's coming
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:59.040]   into us. And so in his article, he talked about the new DNA, and he had a mantra that would kind of
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.720]   basically you could use to then, you know, kind of focus in on that concept and focus in on that
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:11.680]   energy, and then bring your body, you know, up to that higher vibration by using mantras. And so
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.560]   the light vibration of the mantra is absorbed, you know, by the virus consciousness and passed
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:21.200]   on at a virus level, and the virus interests and the guests body ceases. So if you use this
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.240]   meditation, the light vibration will expand to those that are already infected so that the virus
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:31.920]   can participate in this also works. And you know, it's it's also a mantra that's for all of those
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.520]   poor individuals that were forced to end or took, you know, the jab, and and now they've got,
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:45.120]   you know, problems, right? And so this mantra, Pashindrup, can really kind of help that,
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:50.640]   and you know, according to Angi Ekkam. And so again, what you would do is write this mantra down,
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.320]   which is just Pashindrup, and put that in your block, meditate on that, and then have that
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:03.120]   frequency, that that incredible energy of the mantra, you know, broadcast into your field that
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:10.000]   you're living in. And so that's another idea, you know, of how you could use your block in ways
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.600]   you probably haven't thought about, which is basically broadcasting all of this positive energy
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:21.600]   through symbols and numbers and mantras, you know, by using those blocks, you can use you can take
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.560]   advantage of these incredible gifts that the universe have given us. So I wanted to share these
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:31.600]   three ideas with you, because it's just something you may not have thought about before. And so you
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:37.440]   can get the most out of your investment and bring more harmony to your life. So that's it.

[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.080]   share that with you. I've been tinkering around again. Like I said, for three years now, I continue
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:51.680]   to come up with more things as I run across stuff, and I try them out with my blocks. And you know,
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:57.280]   it's just an it's an amazing journey. It is truly an amazing journey, especially when you've done it
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:03.360]   for a few years. And I look back three years ago, and I got to tell you, you know, my vibration is
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.480]   way different. I mean, the way I I just react to everything around me and just everything. It's
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:14.320]   my entire being is different as I progress along this journey of enlightenment. So and that's what
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.560]   these blocks do. And I hope you get the most out of your block. So anyway, thanks for listening
