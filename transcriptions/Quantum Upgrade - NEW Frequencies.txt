[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Aloha, everyone, and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.480]   This video is a special one with Philip von Holzendorf from Quantum Upgrade.
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.260]   We just -- or he just launched a bunch of new frequencies for the Quantum Upgrade service,
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.920]   and it's pretty exciting news because there's some pretty cool frequencies that are brand
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.920]   new.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.920]   They're not even available anywhere else.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.900]   So, I thought I'd just have them on a video call, and let's record just an explanation
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.040]   of what the new frequencies are, share that with the community, and try to answer some
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.640]   general questions that I thought up for a Q&A.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.180]   So, hey, Philip, how are you today?
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.180]   I'm fine.
[00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.180]   Thank you.
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.840]   I'm looking forward to this here.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.600]   Yeah, so if those of you who don't know who Philip is, and you should know him by now,
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.200]   he's a healer, and he's the founder and owner operator of Quantum Upgrade, and also Leila
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.600]   Quantum Tech and Leila Lab.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.800]   So, there's a picture of him, a really good-looking guy, very talented, and he's here
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.700]   to basically explain what all the frequencies and the new frequencies are.
[00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.940]   So, before we jump into that, obviously, we've got a disclaimer.
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.500]   So, if you don't mind, I'm just going to read it to you real fast.
[00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.400]   Either Quantum Upgrade nor the Tinkers Academy recommend or endorse any specific tests,
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.540]   physicians, procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned in this
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.340]   video, reliance on any information appearing, and discussed in this video solely at everyone's
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.340]   own risks.
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.260]   Statements made have not been evaluated by the EFSA or FDA or any governmental derivatives
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.880]   that are of Quantum Upgrade products and products that Quantum Upgrade may represent
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.960]   are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.780]   So, thank you for bearing with us on that, and so, hey, the very first thing, the big
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.840]   news is, well, there's new frequencies added to Quantum Upgrade, and they come in three
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.840]   different flavors.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.160]   That's kind of how I would explain it, right?
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.240]   So, could you explain, like, right now, there are the existing frequency sets on Quantum
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.080]   Upgrade, or as you see right here, there's an abundance one, and then there's a heel
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.220]   one, and each one of them have four, as noted in the white text, frequencies in them today.
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.380]   So, Philip, what have you added to the existing ones?
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.420]   Yes, so everyone that has one or both of these bundles will already have those new frequencies
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.460]   available in their subscriptions.
[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.940]   So, just in the drop-down menu, you can look now, and it's available, and it's ready to
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.300]   be selected.
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.140]   For the abundance bundle, it's the self-love and partnership frequency.
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:31.780]   And, you know, there's actually a story, really, about this one, because there's a lady that,
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.500]   she's actually, she was a TV host, like this millionaire matchmaker show, you know, I don't
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.900]   watch TV, so I didn't even know the show, but apparently it was quite a famous show,
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.560]   and she's quite a famous lady, and she has this partnership platform, you know, where
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.580]   people, you know, meet and all that, and she called us up because she loves what we're
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.240]   doing, and then she was like, "Could you guys create the frequency to find, like, the soul
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.480]   partner, to find the perfect partner?"
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.840]   We told her, "Well, you know, it really doesn't work that way," because there's so
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:18.360]   many reasons to why not, and really, I mean, the most fundamental thing is actually self-love,
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.640]   is if you, if there's no self-love, then you're going to have struggle finding the perfect
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.680]   match, right, and then there's other things, and then she was like, "Yeah, and that totally
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.680]   makes sense and everything," and so we started working on this, and this is the frequency
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.980]   here, so I wanted to just provide some context for that.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.200]   We didn't, you know, really think about this, but it actually came out to be a really wonderful
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.440]   frequency that really works on the self-love, works on the self-awareness also, and then
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:00.520]   with that, you know, helps us to also vibrate that, you know, partnerships and relationships
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.840]   in general can become more fruitful and more matching to our own frequency.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.960]   So obviously, it's something that doesn't work overnight, it's something that we, that's
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.360]   the frequency and a vibration that we work with, and yeah, but I think it's very, very
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.360]   exciting, we're super happy with this, and the other one is the DNA and self-protector
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.760]   frequency, which, you know, people that know Lidaq, they know this frequency already, it's
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.400]   been available as a card for quite some time, so in that sense it's not a new frequency,
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:47.120]   but it's a new for quantum upgrade, and this is basically helping to protect the DNA and
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.800]   the cells in regards to foreign substances, you know, it was developed, you know, I don't
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:01.080]   want to say the word here now, but, you know, along the whole COVID thing, you know, we,
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.920]   this was developed, and that was also something that the customers requested, and a beautiful
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.920]   thing is here, so everyone that has these bundles, it's available now, there's no extra
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:17.920]   cost or anything, and if you want to purchase these now, it's also still the same price
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.920]   as it was before for these bundles.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.880]   Okay, so basically, if you were subscribing to any one of these or both, you got these
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.880]   two new frequencies for free, they're just added to it, set of four, now you got five.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.880]   Yes.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.880]   Cool, correct.
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.720]   Yeah, and you know, the DNA, self-protection for those of you guys, you know, there's going
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.160]   to be descriptions on the website, but bottom line knows, if you're going to be in a crowd
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.600]   of people, it's probably a good idea to turn that on, and that's where we'll stop talking
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   about that one.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.240]   Okay, so then the next one here are the two new sets.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.400]   Okay, so now there's two existing sets where there's now an extra frequency for each one
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.280]   of those, you automatically got them for free, you know, in terms of like there's no additional
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.640]   cost, but now there's two additional sets, so you've got one called source and one boosters,
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.560]   that's my stuff, but hey, you want to talk about source, because these are all, I think
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.920]   primal source is a new one, happiness, I think has been around, focuses something that's been
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.920]   around, right?
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.640]   But this other one, multi-dimensional protection is also new.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.160]   So let's talk about these new bundles, let's start with source.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   Yes.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.320]   Yes, so that's the source frequency bundle and actually the happiness frequencies also
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.440]   new, but I'll get to that, I'll start with the primal source frequencies, so that's one
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.400]   that we've been actually working on for quite some time.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:39.960]   And we've been also testing it for a long time, it's literally the source vibration.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:47.560]   It's very hard to explain, it's easiest to actually experience it.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.440]   There were some amazing tests, so which, you know, they are anecdotal at this point,
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.920]   but it's pretty massive.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:09.520]   So there's friends that we have with a 21-year-old that has Asperger's and they give that girl
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.620]   always a puzzle and like a 1000-piece puzzle, she's able to finish or she was able to finish
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.480]   in three weeks, that's always what she took for 1000-piece puzzle.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:28.680]   Now with this frequency, that happened over a week time, she's had three days.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:37.720]   She gets this done in three days and there's a lot more to it, so to explain the frequency,
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.600]   it's very powerful energy, yet very calm.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:48.800]   So it feels like a very calm expansion and it's absolutely amazing and beautiful.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:55.680]   However, I want to caution also here, like it is with people that start with pure quantum
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:01.680]   energy, very new, things can get triggered, right?
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:08.680]   Because it's really a source frequency and so you don't want to maybe overdo it at first
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:15.800]   if you're, unless you're very tuned in, you know, then go for it, you know?
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:21.400]   It's amazing, it's very supportive and all of that, but at the same time, you know, maybe
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.480]   even emotions come up, right?
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   It could be because it could be in a very positive sentence, but just watch it and maybe ease
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.920]   into that one, but it's pretty amazing.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:46.560]   The happiness frequency, we had a happiness card on the Leela Quantum side, that card
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:53.200]   we took down, I think four months ago or so, and then updated it completely.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:09:02.880]   It was a complete revamp of that frequency and it contains basically the happiness that
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:10.920]   is there as a vibration when the body is created, it's a very powerful energy to get yourself
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.680]   in the body to be very present, so you may feel that if you turn that on that you feel
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:22.200]   very present in your body, more present than usual, and there's this underlying happiness
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:31.160]   that comes with it and what this one also contains now is a little bit, because we were
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:37.320]   wanting that it's not just a frequency that also helps us to get into happiness over time,
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:42.840]   but that also has at least somewhat of an immediate effect, right, where it lifts us
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:50.320]   up a little bit and that is also built into this frequency, so yeah, go check it out.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.480]   It's pretty nice.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:58.720]   The focus frequency, the focus frequency, that is the one that originally we started
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:06.160]   to develop for folks that had ADHD and had asked for such a frequency and then we actually
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:15.160]   brought this and there's no aspects that are supportive for people with Alzheimer and for
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:22.320]   anyone that would like to focus better, that has issues with concentration, right, so that's
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.600]   what it is intended for, and yeah, we're very happy with the result, and then the last
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.240]   one in the mixture in the source frequency bundle is the multi-dimensional protection
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:39.480]   frequency that actually has been asked for for a long time.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.400]   We've had this frequency for a while but never released it and then updated it and Enoch
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:50.400]   shout out to you, I think you've been asking me like 10, 15 times, I apologize, it's been
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:58.560]   taking us so long to release it, but now it's finally here, so this is, you know, a frequency
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:12.120]   that basically transforms and shields anything in regards to, like, for an entity, et cetera,
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:18.280]   et cetera, any types of like dark energies, you know, and entities, you know, that's one
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:24.480]   of those things, right, okay, we don't need to get into that really, but think of it as
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.840]   very low vibrational frequencies, so even like fear frequencies that may be in the field
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.680]   or something like that, I think it's easier to think of it like that rather than entities,
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.640]   some other people think of it as entities, I would rather call it like low vibrational
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.440]   frequencies that can hit us in waves, and it helps us to, you know, shield us.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.960]   Okay, so you set that to like, to your house or something, if you're feeling like, you
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.960]   know, there's some kind of like, bad juju or something, you know, in your house, I don't
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.080]   mean to say that in a funny way, but that's another firm, you know, term for it, but so
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.880]   that would be something that you could set for your house as well as set for your person,
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.880]   right?
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.360]   Is that something that that's a good use case for that?
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:11.720]   Exactly, yeah, I mean, yeah, so I mean, if I don't know, like, maybe you have to visit
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:17.360]   an ad that lives like in some haunted house or whatever, or you always felt like it feels
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.280]   a little bit haunted, then, you know, turn this frequency on and you just have a great
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.280]   day there.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:25.520]   It just kind of clears the space energetically, basically, huh?
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.520]   Okay.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.920]   Okay, so I got a question, you know about primal source.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.760]   How is that difference than the primal human healing in the heal frequency, right?
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:41.000]   There's a primal human healing frequency in the heal set, and then you've got this primal
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.920]   source one.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.600]   So is, are they, they're obviously different, but how are they different than each other?
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.560]   So, yep, that's a great question.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.880]   So the primal source, it's basically oneness.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.520]   Oneness is, that is the source.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.880]   There's only one.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.360]   And so that, that has a certain vibration, it's, there's like a central vibration of
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:12.040]   frequency that that vibrates, and now we're here in this 3D reality, and we're somewhat
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.280]   removed from, we're all, we're never removed from source, right?
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:24.000]   I mean, that is impossible, but like consciously, and even subconsciously, we often feel removed.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.520]   And so that kind of reminds us, it's, it's almost as, we're plugged in again in a different
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.520]   way.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:39.400]   And the primal human healing frequency, which is part of the heal frequency said, that is
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:46.580]   specifically the frequency that enables the body to heal itself.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:55.000]   It is, it is the, it is pretty much the frequency that when the body is created, we still have
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.760]   that complete access to that frequency, because that's the original design of the body that
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.720]   it can heal itself.
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:09.780]   So then we lose access to it, we completely forget that we can even do that.
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:16.960]   And so the, this primal human healing frequency reminds us, and activates this inner healer,
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:22.160]   so that, I'll call it self healing powers, right, that are being activated.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.120]   So in that sense, they're, they're really too completely different frequencies.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.280]   Okay, I get it.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.280]   All right.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.040]   So the heal is healing, but then the source is more like a strength in your connection
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:34.800]   to source, right, higher self, and that's, okay, great.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.840]   So these two new bundles, so are there the same price as the other two, you know, frequency
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.840]   bundles?
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:47.040]   I believe $3 each a month, if you wanted to grab with like just one or the other.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.040]   Exactly.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.040]   Okay.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.040]   All right.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.720]   So you want to explain the boosters or, I'll give a quick overview and then I'll let you
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   talk about it.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.040]   Well, no, because you made some, you made some incredible enhancements.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.360]   So I thought you should, you know, want to go ahead and, yeah, just, you know, go ahead
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.420]   and what's the boosters bundle?
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.420]   What's in that?
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.420]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:15.080]   So, you know, that, that was, that now contains these amazing frequencies that you created
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.600]   with, you know, people are probably, most people are familiar with the man's booster
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:25.080]   and the women's booster, which are, I'll let you explain those specific frequencies.
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:31.000]   And the testosterone is pretty obvious, you know, it's, it's there to help us boost the
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.360]   testosterone levels, which is something actually quite important for men.
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:44.400]   And those testosterone levels over the last, you know, 50 years have been steadily decreasing.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.600]   So it's, it's, it's actually a very nice one for that.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:54.240]   And then the seasonal support is the former allergy relief, which we don't call that way
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.040]   anymore, just because of regulations and we're just being careful and mindful here.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:08.560]   So it's the, the creative description now seasonal support, the inflammation support.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.880]   You know, that's, I think one of the latest ones that, that you develop to help with, with
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:20.240]   inflammation in the body and, you know, Roman added some magic to that as well.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.480]   So it's, it's a very nice one.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:33.440]   And it's, it really supports the body when there is inflammatory aspects in any part
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.840]   of the body, body currently.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:41.340]   So it's, it's something you would probably not really use for business, but you would
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:48.120]   use it certainly for yourself or if you have a pet, this could even be used for a pet because
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.320]   it does help any living organism with, with inflammation.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.120]   I would exclude plants here though.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   Okay.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.120]   All right.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.400]   So there was, so, so Roman kind of upgraded the inflammation.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:04.260]   Did he upgrade any of the other ones for the quantum upgrade frequency, the version?
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:05.260]   Not of the boosters.
[00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.260]   Nope.
[00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.260]   Okay.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.260]   All right.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.260]   Well, that's really cool.
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.360]   So yeah, everyone, you know, if, if, for those of you who aren't familiar with the boosters
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.120]   is just their molecular frequencies that I compiled.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.040]   We did a lot of testing and it came out, you know, where these things, you know, just
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:23.800]   based on just molecular frequencies, using substances, you know, captured using a block,
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.920]   putting together these, you know, combinations and they create like a harmonic and, and that
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.800]   they actually, you know, will help, you know, support you in different things.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.880]   So like the men and women's booster is comprised of, you know, hormone support.
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.520]   So the women's got a, on the women's booster, it's like meant for, you know, both of these
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.440]   kind of meant for middle-aged folks, you know, they helped them with their home, you know,
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.000]   hormonal support, immune support, stress, you know, stress relief.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.440]   Brain function and anti-aging.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.240]   So those two have been around for since the beginning and then testosterone again, again,
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.240]   the other three.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.920]   So, so that's the booster bundle.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.680]   So that's one of the new ones.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.200]   Now, so you have access to all of the, you know, the frequencies I created plus the new
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.440]   ones in the source.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:10.000]   And so now each one of those so that you got four bundles now, four sets, right?
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.600]   If you go on the website, you'll see abundance, you'll see heel, you'll see source, you'll
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:19.640]   see boosters, and if you wanted to acquire any one of those and then correct me from
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:25.360]   wrong, it slates $10 each right a month to add it to your subscription at this, you know,
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.360]   right?
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.360]   Yes.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.360]   Okay.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.360]   I just want to make sure.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.680]   So then there's this third thing that we were going to talk about today, which is now
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:37.520]   the brand new one, which is called the all-in-one frequency bundle.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.320]   And so can you, you know, can you explain what that is?
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.320]   And the price?
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   Yes.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.840]   And that is like literally the best bargain, you know, in terms of just like having access
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.040]   to all of them would be really cool.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.040]   Yes.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:55.720]   And so the team is currently working hard, actually, on putting in the overview of all
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.520]   the frequencies that are included in this bundle, which is all of them that we have
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.520]   on quantum upgrades.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.360]   So it's pretty easy to install.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.560]   Once you click on it in the shop, I think, I think now they're added and they're adding
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.520]   the descriptions as we speak.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:17.720]   So it's for $25 a month, you can have access to all of the frequencies.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:23.800]   So that's basically currently 19 different frequencies, which you can use at any time.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:27.280]   Yeah, as long as you have that all-in-one bundle.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:33.320]   And if you currently have, let's say you have a heel bundle and you have the abundance bundle,
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.120]   that's $20 a month.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:41.320]   So now for $5 more, you basically get two more bundles.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.320]   You get them all.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.200]   Extra two frequencies that you just got.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.960]   And how that works, actually, is I should know how exactly this works.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:56.960]   I would say, you know, reach out to Emma or just purchase the all-in-one bundle and
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:04.520]   cancel your heel bundle and your abundance bundle, if you have those, for example, and
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.200]   then you want to upgrade, that's the way to do it.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.200]   Okay.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.200]   Yeah, that's...
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.200]   Technically.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.200]   Okay, great.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.200]   Because that was the very...
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.400]   I had to come up with some Q and A's for this and that was my very first question, because
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.560]   I just know anyone who's got the two of them now, it's going to go, "Hey, five books more,
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:18.560]   I get them all."
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.560]   You know, so they're going to do it.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.320]   Support Emma is going to be very busy.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.120]   So the first question that I had for you, Philip, was, "Where can I...
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.120]   Wait, wait, the second question.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.840]   How do I switch?"
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:28.840]   So that's the answer.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.840]   How do you switch?
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.680]   If you have one or two and then you want to get all four, contact Emma, is that through the
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.280]   email or through Telegram what's preferable?
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:44.920]   I think generally email better, that's preferred, but Telegram works as well, so people want
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920]   that.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.920]   Okay.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.280]   So if you have any of them and you want to switch, then there you go.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:55.280]   But the other question too is, if somebody wanted an in-depth description of each frequency,
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:02.560]   I noticed that on the test pages for these new frequency bundles that you've got way
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.920]   better descriptions now.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.840]   So is that where we could recommend, "Hey, you know, if you want to know what each frequency
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.800]   does and what it's for, then it's actually going to be on the website now on Quantum
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.800]   Upgrade?"
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.800]   Yes.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:15.800]   Exactly.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   Yeah, that's where I found them.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:21.680]   So yeah, so if you guys want a lot more in-depth explanation as to each one of these, then right
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:26.560]   when you click on each one of these bundles, under it will be a list of all of the descriptions
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.680]   for each one per bundle, okay?
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.320]   And so that's how you'll get the descriptions and kind of give you an idea what they're
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.320]   for.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.120]   And then you always can jump on Telegram if you want to go, "Hey, is this applicable
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.120]   to that?"
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.680]   You know, that's what telegraphs for to answer those questions.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:40.680]   So all right.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.160]   So that's where you can find descriptions.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.160]   That's how you switch.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.960]   The third question I had for you was, you know, this gets asked all the time, you know,
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:53.040]   and people are asking, "Can they use more than one frequency at a time, you know, on
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.640]   a single subscription?
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.640]   Is that...
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.640]   I know that.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.120]   And so the answer to that is, "No," right?
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.120]   No.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.120]   Okay.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.120]   So you only can do...
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:11.360]   So you can set a maximum of two frequencies, but only one for the day and one for the night.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.360]   So at a given time, there's only always one frequency active.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.360]   Okay.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.160]   Will you ever...
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:24.120]   Are you ever thinking about allowing people to have more than one at a time, like one during
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.640]   the day and more than one at night?
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.720]   I don't think so, to be honest, because it's not really recommended and it's also technically
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.240]   it would be very, very difficult.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.760]   So I'm pretty certain that it's going to stay this way.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.760]   Okay.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.760]   All right.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.760]   And that's going to be per subscription.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.040]   So if I have one for me, I have one for my daughter, one for future son-in-law, one for
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:51.360]   both dogs, then each one of them can have a frequency, day or night.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:55.280]   But I personally, or my dog, or my daughter can't have two, right?
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.080]   So it's per subscription, correct?
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:07.960]   Yeah, exactly, so if you have a pick five bundle, then all of those subscriptions would have
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:13.160]   the frequency available and you can set the heal for your daughter, the primal source for
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:19.520]   you, the happiness for a friend, whatever, that's totally fine.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.520]   Okay.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.920]   You know, the number four, I think one of the other questions that people are, you know,
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.600]   it's not as clear as we could make it because it's so much information.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:33.640]   But the idea though, is when you look at each one of these frequencies, you know, you read
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.480]   the description and then the first thing you're thinking is, okay, well obviously all of these
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.680]   are designed for you as a human.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.560]   But the question then becomes is, well, which one of these, you know, could I use with my
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:50.500]   dog or could I use with my cat, could I use on my business, could I put on a home?
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:55.700]   And it seems like that's where the, you know, the directions get a little fuzzy.
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.940]   So what would, you know, because I know the descriptions that we just mentioned are descriptions
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:07.100]   of what the frequencies do, but how can people find out more about, hey, which one of these
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:12.940]   are like, you know, are suitable for my home and then, you know, pets and, you know, we're
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.700]   going to get that information.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.900]   That's a great question.
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:23.260]   So maybe we should work on making that a little bit more obvious in the, either in the drop
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:29.220]   down menu, or I'll give it a thought about you that so yeah, I mean, I can, for the people
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:34.740]   listening now, I mean, obviously for the business, you can use the abundance, the prosperity,
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:41.060]   the gratitude, you could even use the Agni power for that.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.300]   You can use the happiness.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:47.380]   You can use the focus, you can use the multi-dimensional protection.
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.700]   You can use the final source.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.820]   I would not use the boosters.
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.060]   I would not necessarily use the heel.
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.060]   The heel is possible.
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:01.060]   We've tried that, but, you know, I don't think it's like the go-to one weight management.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.460]   I wouldn't use nutrition biopays.
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.260]   I wouldn't use DNA and cell protector.
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.540]   I wouldn't use for business, but inner piece is possible.
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.580]   So maybe that's a quick overview.
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:15.540]   And then for humans, obviously, all of these, for homes, you can pretty much also use all
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.540]   of these here.
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:20.580]   Just like a business, yeah.
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:26.540]   Yeah, but even you could use the DNA and cell protector for home, because if you're in
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.700]   there with, you know, I mean, your family and you just want to have that frequency turned
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:37.500]   on in general, you can do that, or I don't know, maybe, you know, if you have a bar, a
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.340]   restaurant or something like that, you know, I can just think, okay, maybe even in times
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:47.900]   where you think that will be your grade frequency, you could set that even, you know, just use
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.500]   common sense for that, I would say.
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:55.540]   And then for pets, I think we'll release a pet bundle.
[00:25:55.540 --> 00:26:03.060]   But at this point, you know, there's maybe a few here that you could use for pets as
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.060]   well.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:09.180]   The primary source is one you can use for pets.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:14.700]   The happiness should actually also be working fine with pets.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:22.420]   And then, yeah, the rest is more, you know, for humans rather.
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.420]   Okay.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.420]   All right.
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.220]   What weight management, do you think that'd be okay for a dog?
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:35.300]   Yeah, I think actually, yes, if you're concerned about weight, then that should also be fine
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.300]   with a dog.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:42.100]   Yeah, me and my dog, we share body types and we got to work on it.
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.620]   Okay.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.620]   Last question.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:48.460]   And let's see, is how long, okay, this is another question I see all the time in the
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.460]   group, right?
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.580]   How long should I have a frequency activated?
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:55.900]   And its companion question is often, how often can I change frequencies?
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:00.500]   So, you know, for the best effect, should I leave it on for a day, a few days, a week
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.500]   at a time.
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:05.380]   I mean, you know, my thinking, and I've always recommended to people is, you know, it takes
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.820]   time to entrain to these frequencies for your body to kind of, you know, really kind of
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.660]   been trained with them.
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.300]   And I always recommend at least a few days, but what's your recommendation on, you know,
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.780]   when I want to experience a frequency, how long should I turn it on?
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:23.700]   And then how, you know, and that's the other half of that question, obviously, is how often
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.700]   can I change?
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.140]   Can I do one every, you know, a different one every day?
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:31.140]   You know, what do you, what do you want to recommend to people to get the most out of
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:35.540]   their investment in these frequencies and their experience?
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.540]   Yep.
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.260]   So the whole palette is possible, to be honest.
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:45.340]   So you can have a frequency set for just a very short time and change it up quite a bit,
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:49.980]   or you can have it run for really a longer period of time.
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:56.820]   And I know that sometimes it's easier to read a manual on how to operate a TV.
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.980]   And if you press this button, this is going to happen.
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:05.380]   But with this, it's really, we ask people not to think it through, but to really feel.
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.540]   What is it that you feel?
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:13.860]   If you set it for yourself, do you feel that it would be good for you to have it on for
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:15.140]   the next several days?
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.140]   And then whenever you get the feeling, oh, I want to change it, then go with that.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:23.780]   Like really try to listen to your feeling, to your inner voice.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.660]   That's what we really encourage people to do.
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:30.740]   Now, if you have issues with that, I know you want some general rules and guidelines.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.300]   So here's what I would do.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:41.620]   I would run a frequency usually for a whole day or half a day, at least, to see how you
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.980]   resonate with it and what it does.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:51.980]   And then try to ask yourself in the morning, okay, what would be a good frequency today?
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:52.980]   Okay.
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:53.980]   And then you'll get an answer.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:29:00.940]   And don't think you could have a wrong answer because even if it comes up to be not the perfect
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:03.980]   one, then you'll feel it again and you'll change it.
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.300]   Just start trusting yourself.
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:11.380]   With the primal source frequency, I would suggest, if you're one that meditates, for
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:15.700]   example, does yoga or something like that, you walk in nature, something like that, turn
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:21.120]   that on the first time when you're doing an activity like that, where you can be very
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:25.420]   present and you can feel that frequency.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:33.060]   And with that one, maybe just do it for a few hours and then turn it back off, unless
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:39.180]   you really feel amazing right away with it, you can leave it on to longer.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:45.260]   And with that one, I would say for the first two, three days, start easing into that and
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.260]   then you can run it basically all the time.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:53.500]   And I can give you an example with myself, actually, interestingly, the inner piece frequency,
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:59.500]   I think I've had it now on for four months in a row at nights.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.300]   I'm not changing.
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.300]   Hey, guys.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.300]   Can you hear me?
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.740]   Hey, I probably really don't need it anymore.
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.740]   I can hear you.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:07.740]   Sorry.
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.740]   Cool.
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.740]   Awesome.
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:10.740]   How's it going?
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:11.740]   Good.
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:12.740]   We're doing great.
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:13.740]   We're just wrapping up the frequency video.
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:18.740]   So it was like three minutes or two minutes and we're almost done.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.740]   Sorry.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.740]   Thank you.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.740]   Go ahead, Philip.
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:23.740]   Yeah.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.500]   So that's even also possible, right?
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:32.500]   At this point, I probably really don't need to have the inner piece frequency on anymore,
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.260]   but I still feel like it's nice.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.220]   It's just nice to have it at nights.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:43.100]   And I love how it helps with the jet lag, for example, I've just experienced it again.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.340]   Yeah, and that's how I do it.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.540]   So I feel what's good.
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:52.380]   And then now, obviously with all these new frequencies, there's more options and it even
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:57.340]   more helps you to feel, right, because, okay, so what is the frequency for me today?
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:58.900]   What helps me the most?
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:03.500]   What do I need and then go with that?
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.940]   And it's a great way of training and practicing your perception.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:08.940]   Okay.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:09.940]   Not great.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:10.940]   Thanks.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:11.940]   That's a great answer.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.380]   And so that wraps up the new frequencies for quantum upgrades.
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:19.940]   So if anyone's got any additional questions, you know, go ahead and post them in Telegram.
[00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:23.260]   And as always, you know, if you want to reach us, we have the Quantum Upgrade Community
[00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.420]   on Telegram.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.140]   All the links will be in the video description below.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.100]   If you want to reach me, I'm at the Tinkers Academy.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.740]   And the website obviously is quantumupgrade.io.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.300]   So Philip, thank you very much for your help and explanation of this.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:37.220]   And I think it's really exciting.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.220]   Can't wait to switch over.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.980]   I think I already did switch over right to the all-in-one.
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.540]   So yeah, looking forward to trying out some of these new frequencies.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.300]   So thank you very much for your time today.
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.300]   Thank you.
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:48.300]   All right.
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:48.300]   Have a good one.
