[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and this
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.920]   video is a further installment in the video series. Welcome to Layla Q otherwise known as Layla
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.240]   Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade, a video FAQ series to answer frequently asked questions
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.120]   in our Telegram chat groups. Today's question in this video is the frequently asked question
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.920]   we get on what is quantum energy. Now there's two answers to that. First of all there's a
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.880]   very long answer to that as we've been kind of plugging along for the last few years trying to
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.000]   help people understand what quantum energy is. So I personally have done two video series on the
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.400]   subject. One of the video series and all the links will be in the video description below for anyone
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   who likes you know who likes to kind of get into the detail of things but essentially what my
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.680]   approach has been is to look at quantum energy initially from the classical academic concepts of
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.760]   quantum mechanic theory and so forth and then try to make that leap behind this Einsteinian model
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.720]   of the universe and particle physics and then trying to understand how does the Layla quantum
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.080]   tech idea or definition of quantum energy fit into that current academic model. And so I kind of have
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.440]   been I worked on a series this year it's a three part series called what is quantum energy where I
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.040]   really walk through each of the various things to kind of take into account when trying to understand
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.000]   this idea of a non-Einsteinian quantum mechanics view of the universe. And so that's kind of what
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.480]   that series is the other series I created has gone one we've been doing this for three years in a row
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.360]   and that's been sitting down with Philip von Holzendorf of Layla quantum tech and their chief
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.840]   science advisor, Ian Mitchell and sitting down and having these open discussions about that very
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.520]   concept about the idea of you know traditional academic quantum mechanics and and how does that
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.640]   relate to what the definition of quantum energy is from the Layla quantum tech perspective and so
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.560]   there's a three part series there called the science of quantum energy where it's discussions
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.280]   amongst the three of us as I'm throwing out tons of ideas at them and getting them to you know
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.560]   getting Layla quantum tech themselves to respond to those questions that you would normally have if
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.120]   you were classes you know quantum mechanics type of person so that's one long answer there's six
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.400]   videos in that series they're very educational and they're very interesting that conversations
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.040]   all the data that's shared so if that's something of interest to you then you know go to the links
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.440]   in the video description below now I also want to share that if there's another longer answer as
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.640]   well that if you go to the website on Layla quantum tech you go to the press section you know the
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.920]   idea that this question has been raised every single time Philip von Holzendorf has been interviewed
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.840]   and so now I just want to point out that if you go into the press section you can go onto
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.840]   anyone of the various articles where Philip has appeared in magazines talking about quantum energy
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.760]   he's been quoted in numerous articles he's been on numerous media appearances and
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.280]   you know just all over the map he's been doing this for four years now and he explains in great
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.520]   detail in a lot of these interviews magazine articles and even his own conference presentations
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.560]   in which he describes you know what is quantum energy and all the other related topics therefore
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.680]   so if you wanted to get really into the weeds on what quantum energy is as defined by
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.120]   Layla quantum tech then that's really a great place to start now what I've done is just sort of
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.800]   taking the definitions now and we put Einsteinian quantum energy mechanics all that to the side
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.280]   and we just say look what is this new model of quantum mechanics what is this new concept of
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.920]   quantum energy which essentially translates into life force energy you know the air
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.960]   vetics called it Akasha the ancient Polynesians called it mana you know and the
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.360]   Asians called it Chi or or Key you know and it's just it's that same energy you know it's that same
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.920]   energy and that's the whole kind of confusion around what is quantum energy because it has many
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.320]   different names but it is not particle physics it is not the concept of quantum as we come to
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.440]   understand it for those of you who took it in in school and studied it but instead it's another
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:20.080]   entirely different view of reality that because of the work that Layla has commissioned with
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:27.600]   numerous studies is proven to be accurate and when I see when I say accurate I mean it is real
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.400]   it is scientifically back it exists it does things and and it is the most remarkable discovery
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   of our age and for some of us you know we understand that is it really a discovery or is it simply a
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.720]   rediscovery of what the ancients knew about life force you know about the idea of Akasha
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:54.320]   and Chi and really it's in my personal opinion it is a rediscovery of of what the idea behind
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.600]   a unifying you know consciousness field and how the energy of that field is all driven by us
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.760]   by our own perceptions and our own reality of how we see the world so without further ado I kind of
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.640]   as a tinker you know I kind of been tinkering around with different AI video generation tools
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:19.040]   and I kind of put together taking the basically the actual definition from Layla Quantum Tech
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.600]   now this is the actual script that they you know the the information that they provide their customers
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.880]   and I made a little video out of it to kind of just share with you their perspective on exactly
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.240]   what they see as quantum energy so without further ado here you go quantum energy is essential for
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.440]   life every unit of matter contains quantum energy and so do ourselves this means that every person
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.080]   has a quantum energy field and is constantly interacting with other quantum energy fields
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:57.440]   inside our bodies the cells communicate via these quantum fields just like other bodily systems
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.160]   your quantum energy field can become disrupted by many different things such as toxicity
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.880]   malnourishment and stress of any kind in today's world we are constantly bombarded with emf
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.560]   harmful substances and stress this is why we develop and test our products with the intention
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.600]   to help mitigate the harmful effects activate the body self-healing powers and strengthen our
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.840]   quantum energy field the pure quantum energy we're using is also part of every cell it is a form
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:32.640]   of source energy worldwide absolutely unique we were able to create devices that not only create
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.080]   a concentrated and pure quantum energy space but are also highly advanced in regards to quantum
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.160]   consciousness levels yes you could even call it intelligence there are fairly dumb quantum energy
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.520]   fields we can disturb quantum energy fields and then there are true quantum spaces that come with
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.120]   almost unimaginable intelligence and quantum consciousness levels that is what the blocks are
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:01.200]   the energy of these blocks invites us as well as any living being into our completeness
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.880]   physically and energetically and it supports us on that path it supports and emphasizes what
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.280]   life and consciousness supports and it can neutralize what's destructive and harmful for
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.880]   physical organisms and consciousness there are endlessly more things it does but that is an
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.400]   essence worthwhile to be understood it can support us on an energetic and physical level
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.840]   directly via the cells on the cell level the energy of the blocks reminds the cells that come
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:33.280]   in contact of their optimal state that signal and the supportive energy with it invite each of
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.880]   these just mentioned cells to become the optimal ideal version of itself what happens in the
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.960]   micro perspective also happens in the macro perspective now it gets complicated because everyone is
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.520]   so different it's not complicated at all actually but to our minds it is for some it can mean
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.640]   instant relief or transformation of issues whether it be the solving of a blockage of a traumatic
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:03.440]   experience or whatever it may be for others it may take some time again others see some results
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:09.360]   faster and others much later it is because we are all different with different stories different
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.800]   experiences different belief systems different soul plans different trauma that may have been
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.560]   experienced etc. fundamentally it is important to understand that everything is energy and frequency
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.520]   what you see in the physical world with the physical eyes is only a way to see that part of
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:31.760]   the reality in this way well that's really it it is really truly about the way we perceive
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:38.640]   and our consciousness drives and because we can drive the energy and manifest reality from it out
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:45.840]   of the quantum field then these tools that lay the quantum cells and the quantum upgrade service
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:53.040]   this incredible energy that is being emanated from these products and these services is that actual
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:09:00.160]   consciousness energy and it is really part of our real world regardless of what we learned
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:07.280]   that it did whether or not it exists or not and it does and that's the most beautiful part about it
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:14.000]   and these tools will incredibly uplift your environment with that pure quantum energy
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.640]   and when you tap your consciousness into it a magic of things happen so but anyway that's the
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.360]   answer to what is quantum energy if you've got more questions you know feel free to jump into
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.920]   chat groups all the links below in the video description and thank you so much for your time
