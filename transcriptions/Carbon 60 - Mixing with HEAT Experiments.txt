[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me K. L. Moran. In this video,
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.680]   I am just sharing the results of my experiments using heat during the stirring process of making
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.640]   C60 oil. It came out pretty interesting. I thought I'd share it. I thought you'd be interested in.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.920]   Let's jump in. So first thing you need to know is that I'm not doing this for grades or getting
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:31.440]   paid. So I did mix stuff around. It's not apples to apples. So give me a break. Please don't
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.720]   give me a hard time about that. So things were changing during the experiment and I just want
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.000]   to point out what was changing. So one of the things that was changing was the type of C60 I was
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.920]   using because I get it from Layla Labs. And the older version, they just switched to a new version.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.600]   So when I did it the first time, it was the old version, which is just regular powdered C60.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.120]   And then in experiments two and three, I used their newer version, which they call pulverized.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.520]   And if you look at the difference between the two and sorry, I don't have a picture. The original
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.240]   one is more granular like typical powdered C60 you buy anywhere. And then the newer one is much
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.800]   more finer in texture kind of like, you know, granulated sugar versus powdered sugar, right?
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.320]   Except black. And so that's kind of the difference between, you know, the different textures of the
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.680]   C60, same C60, 99.95 purity from Layla Labs, just the texture was different during the course of the
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.880]   three experiments. So keeping that in mind. And then what I did try based on the results of one,
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.520]   I would try something different to the next and different the next, which is my methodology. Okay,
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.600]   like I said, I'm not doing this to get paid or getting any grades. No one's grading my homework
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.080]   here. So I don't care. So but you'll find out, you know, what the results are. I think are pretty
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.240]   much speak for themselves. So I did change the type of oil from one to two to three. I'm just
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.920]   using up what I got in my house. Okay, so avocado, and then I used a Bragg's olive oil, then I used
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.520]   Elinora. And so then but the key thing was was I was trying to see what happens when you stir
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.880]   just 24 hours at 67 degrees. And then I did it again, 24 hours at 67 degrees. And then seven days
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.960]   at 26 degrees to kind of compare three against two with number one being my baseline. Okay,
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.000]   that's kind of what I did. The one thing that's weird about one was I was spaced out that morning,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.640]   and I've put in a full gram instead of the regular 0.8 gram, which is kind of cool when you see what
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.480]   happened to it. Anyway, so after I did these stirs, I'd let it settle for 10 days, and then I'd filter
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.280]   it. Yeah, always filter using a .22 micron filter. Okay, standard. So that's kind of what I did. So
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.080]   let's go ahead and let's walk through the results. So first things first, this is the pulverized with
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.120]   avocado 67 degrees stirring 24 hours. Now check that out. Whoops. Okay, so this is what I want
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.240]   to point out right here. See that? That's the bottom of the flask. And all you see are these
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.640]   a little larger. They're probably like, I don't know, that's got to be like a few hundred nanometers
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.960]   across. But the tiny little, that's it though. That's all that C 60 that's left after I pulverized
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.920]   it. Okay, so I bought the regular powdered. I pulverized it myself in a steel mortar pestle.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.760]   Just put the powder in there, add a little bit of oil, just grind it down and then spatula it
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.160]   into the oil. Really simple stuff. But this is what happens when you pulverize your own,
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.520]   you stick it in the oil, and this was only 24 hours stirring now. Okay, and the only thing I did
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:37.040]   wrong with this one is I forgot to record what it what the oil looks like. I just recorded it with
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.680]   the flask. There we go. Okay, so so that's what it looked like. And and so there was almost no
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.840]   residual C 60 left in the flask. And then of course that's the finished product, but you
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.480]   I forgot to be, you know, you could see the light shining through it. Now this is the next one. Okay,
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.280]   now this one is experiment number two, only 24 hours again, 67 degrees again for 24 hours,
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.240]   all of oil this time, not avocado, but this was not pulverized, meaning I didn't mess with it.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.880]   So I just bought it, you know, it's it's got a finer texture, but I didn't do anything to it.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.760]   I just put it in the oil, and it kind of clumps up and then spins around. So it's kind of cool
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.160]   what it looks like when it does that. I actually posted that to telegram. So it's not, I didn't
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.680]   pulverize it. It's supposedly pulverized ahead of time. But this is what it looks like. And it's
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.200]   very fine. You can see the very fine texture. And I'll tell you know, after 24 hours, there was
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.400]   definitely residual C 60 left. So my thinking on this one was like, okay, I didn't pulverize it
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.120]   this time. It did really well in the avocado oil. And I didn't mess with it. But when you
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.200]   don't mess with it, this is what happened. So I thought, okay, so that was 24 hours, 67 degrees.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.560]   But what the cool thing is, though, and I really want to point this out, just 24 hours at heat,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.480]   these are what the filters look like. I just did 350 milliliters per filter. So the first two came
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.080]   out clear. Obviously, the last one has the sediment because that's the bottom. And then this, but
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.160]   this is what's nice. This is the filtered product, the finished product, right? Check that out.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.360]   It's perfect. It's beautiful. And when you look at the amount of residual remaining
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.680]   on the, well, you know, it's quite a bit, I would say, you know, quite a bit in terms of how much
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.600]   I put in and I put 0.8 grams. And I would say that there's, I don't know, I'm guessing, you know,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.000]   maybe like, I probably saturated a good 90% of it. But what's left on the bottom of the of this
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.640]   right here, plus what's on the filter, you know, it's definitely, you know, there's some left behind.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:43.040]   So I would say at least 90% saturation of 0.8 grams do the math. Okay. But that was batch number two.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.640]   We're using heat. So the first thing I wanted to do after this batch was the third batch.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:55.120]   I wanted to see, okay, so now what happens with the third batch was I didn't, again, I just used the
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:03.760]   C60 right out of the the vial. I didn't mess with it. It's, you know, the finer course,
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.000]   the finer grain C60, put that in 0.8 per liter. And you can see the finished product here is just
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.520]   this beautiful crimson red, which is what you want. Right. That's the finished product. And this time,
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.560]   though, how much of the C60 was left behind? This was one week of stirring, but only at 26 degrees
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.400]   centigrade, roughly room temperature. Right. And so this is what was interesting. There was a
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:35.840]   lot more C60 left behind at a lower temperature. So you can see how much is like sitting in there.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.000]   I mean, just look at the, it's quite a bit. I would say it's probably equal to the other one.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.520]   It is a little darker, though, in terms of, you know, it's so hard to measure this. So I'm guessing
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:51.120]   another 90% saturation. I left some C60 behind. And then what's interesting here is that the
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:58.320]   filter showing the brown residue, which is essentially the impurities of the C60 powder itself is what
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:05.040]   turns brown, not the oil. So the point here that I want to make is that my findings are based on
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.400]   these three separate batches. What that was that number one is that even though, you know, the
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:16.240]   product says it comes pulverized and that when you look at it, it does look finer, like powdered,
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.960]   right, versus granular. It's still, I think, very important that when you're making C60 oil,
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:30.000]   you get a stainless steel mortar pestle and then just grind it yourself. Just grind it down as
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.160]   just as fine as you can get it after you, you know, you buy it with the oil and then put it in because
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.000]   definitely one of the findings was was that if you pulverize it yourself before you add it to oil,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.480]   then you have a much higher saturation, okay, right off the bat. And then the second thing,
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.560]   though, was when you look at the two that were heated versus the one that wasn't,
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:56.720]   that was just at 26 degrees centigrade, that stirring with heat does reduce the stirring time.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:03.120]   It was you got a much fuller saturation or you got a good saturation, I should say, with heat,
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.280]   then you did with room temperature. So there's something there. And I think that the outcome of
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.800]   these three experiments is really these two things is that if you pulverize your C60 before you add
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:21.200]   it to oil and you use heat, then you can really, really, really reduce your stirring time. But then
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.880]   you've got the argument, right, as the experiment show, you don't get that full point eight saturation.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.600]   But I want to point out something that was in my last video on C60. What have we learned? It was
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:39.920]   an addendum to part one. And it was this video that the C60 EVO guys, which is the same guys as
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:47.200]   SES research, those guys put a post to the comment in my video and pointed to this video that they
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:54.320]   had made. And this is what I want to point out now. C60 EVO quote says, hey, Chris Burris on SES research
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:03.360]   labs, purchased 22 online C60 products in March of 2020 to test their C60 concentrations per their
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.960]   label. Now everybody's label says 0.8 milligrams per mill year. Here's the deal. The lab called the
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:16.320]   overall results woefully low, because many of the companies, not only 10 to 30% of the maximum
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:23.920]   concentrations promised. So when you looked at the video a second ago, you saw that there was a good,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.520]   you know, 90% of the C60 was gone. It was not laying on the bottom of the beaker. It wasn't stuck in
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.560]   the filter. It was gone. It was in the oil. And so, you know, we're talking about even if
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:41.280]   it leaves residual. This is my pointer, actually. My point is, is that even if it leaves residual,
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:49.280]   you are getting a much higher concentration product than you could buy online by doing it yourself.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:56.000]   And if you use heat, you can do it a lot faster. So that's is my point is, hey, if you want to make
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.960]   C60 oil, you want to do it really quickly. And you want to have a really good product. Hey, the best
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.240]   idea, I think we can come up with at this point. And I want to tinker some more. But hey, use heat,
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.720]   get a hot plate, you know, get a hot plate stir. And you know, they're not cheap. I'm sorry if,
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:17.120]   you know, for those you guys, you can't afford them. But it's if you can, if you make a lot of
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.800]   batches, it might be worth it to you. Okay, that's my point. And so, but use heat and boom, 24
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.840]   hours, let it sit for 10 days. And there you go. My next experiment's just going to be stirred 24
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.760]   hours and then filter and see what that looks like. I'm going to do that next. But I ran out of
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:37.280]   my Ron bottles to store the stuff. I got three liters stacked up plus extra. I got way too much
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.520]   CCC oil right now. I got it. I got to, I got to consume it down before I make more batches. So,
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.240]   but that's what I'll be doing in the future. And there you go. That's what I learned. And I
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.840]   wanted to share it with you. And hey, thank you for listening to me blather about this. I just
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.680]   finished the last one this morning. As I said, thought I just whipped this up together real quick
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.520]   and kind of just share it with you. Because I found it to be really interesting. Because you know
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.480]   what no one has ever talked about doing this before. We've talked about using ultrasonics and we've
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:11.120]   talked about stirring. And but here we go. Use heat. There's the new secret on how to make it
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:18.480]   quickly. You could get it done in 11 days. And that's a pretty cool thing. So, there you go.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.560]   And you might even be able to get it done in one day. That's going to be my next experiment. But
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.920]   hey, there's something for you to tinker with. Thank you again for watching my video. Really
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:31.440]   appreciate your time. Happy New Year. And also, if you have any questions about making C60 oil,
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.920]   you know, hey, you can always reach me and other folks that are doing it all the time over on our
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.200]   telegram C60 chat group links in the video description below. Mahalo. And thank you very
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.360]   much. You guys have a good day.
