[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   Hello and welcome to my three-part video series on carbon 60. This is part three making your own
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.480]   C60 oil. I'm Kielmer and before I begin I'd like to let you know that everything I'll be talking
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.840]   about in this video has links in the video description. There's a bunch of links in there. If you want
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.160]   to learn more, you want to buy something, you just want to find out stuff. Boom, right there in the
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.480]   video description, go take a look at those links. All right, let's begin. First thing,
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.800]   making carbon 60 oil. Okay, how did the scientists do it? This is a little snippet right out of the
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.440]   rat study on section two materials and methods and it comes down to this. There was only two
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.960]   ingredients. There was a Kemlale virgin olive oil from Tunisia was the olive oil that they used
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.440]   and the C60 powder was at a purity of 99.98% and they got it from SES research.
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.280]   That was it. Their instructions and the method that they used to create their C60 oil
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.840]   was they dissolved the C60 by stirring it into the oil over two weeks and doing so in the dark.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.760]   After that was finished, they centrifuge the oil at five Gs for one hour and then after that,
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.440]   then they filtered it through a 25 micron millipore filter and that was it. That's how they produced
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.440]   the oil that they gave to those rats. Now, when you're thinking about making this at home,
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.040]   obviously your choices are this. You can either follow to the letter of the rat study so that you
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.880]   can stick to the exact way that they did it using the exact same oil using the exact same C60 powder
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.120]   and doing it exactly like them. Clearly, that's a choice. There's also another consideration
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.000]   that I wanted to share with you because I found that in my research. What I ran across was this
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.040]   video of an interview that Anthony from C60Net did with Fati Musa who was one of the scientists
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.640]   in the study and it's really interesting because in this video interview of the scientist, Tony asks
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.440]   him specifically, is it critical to centrifuge and filter the C60 or can researchers just use
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.360]   the oil? What was interesting was this is what he said. He said, "For scientific reasons,
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.800]   we need to filter it to know the exact dose that we administered because C60 is soluble in oil.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.720]   But if someone gave it to an animal by himself, it is not necessary to filter it because the
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.760]   C60 crystals will be eliminated and what will be absorbed is only the soluble part."
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.760]   So there, that is really important when you're thinking about making this at home. The guy is
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.600]   saying that, "Hey, we had to use centrifuges and filters because we had to make sure in scientists
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.320]   that every single batch was exactly like the other batch before it because it's a scientific
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.360]   study. You can't have variances in what you're administering to the rats." And then when you
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.880]   look at what the commercial producers are doing, they're pretty much following what the rats study
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.040]   did because they also have to produce every single product, every single run has got to be exactly
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.840]   like the last run because consistency in product is the mainstay of doing it right and from a
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.200]   manufacturing standpoint. So right there, one of the scientists is saying, "Hey, you know,
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.920]   you don't really need to do that if you're not running a study." And so that's a really important
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.880]   little data point and keep that in mind as we walk through the other considerations
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.800]   of making your own C60 at home. So number two is the type of oil.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.440]   What type of oil are you going to use or are using right now and how does that work for you?
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.760]   Because if you remember from part two, you know, all of the different vendors are kind of all over
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.640]   the map. Now from a standpoint of the majority do use olive oil. They use different olive oils
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.760]   from different places and you've got some vendors doing coconut and avocado and sunflower and blends.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.400]   So it's kind of all over the map in terms of what oil is the best oil and so and what one are you
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.920]   going to choose. And so the thing to think about when you're looking at the oil or you're choosing
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.400]   the oil you plan on using, you can either stick to exactly what they did and there's a link below.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.000]   I actually found a place that sells kimlali olive oil from Tunisia, believe it or not,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.280]   $34 for 750 milliliters. By the way, I don't sell it. Or you can go with any other kind of
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.440]   different oil. So here's what you need to think about when you're looking at type of oil.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.840]   First of all, is it certified? Is it real? Really important. I talked about that earlier.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.000]   It's so it's so important now that you look to make sure you do your research, Google it and say,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.240]   hey, is this product certified? Meaning the third-party lab says, yeah, this is really real sunflower
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.280]   oil or this is real olive oil. It's, you know, we certified it in a lab from a third party and,
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.080]   yeah, they're not, you know, it's not a counterfeit, right? And so making sure that it's certified,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.480]   it's a big deal. In fact, when I bought some olive oil I have, I gave, there's a link below
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.200]   for a list of olive oil brands that are certified. And so I bought one of those for the dog.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.680]   Now, there's also the other issue is organic and non-GMO. Obviously, we're doing this for our health.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.200]   So, you know, you want to go with the best oil, the real oil and the best oil that you can get
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.080]   that's for your health and whether or not it's digestible. A lot of people have different issues
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.320]   with different kinds of oil. They might not be able to digest it well. And so keep that in mind.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.000]   And taste is also very important. My dog prefers olive oil. I prefer coconut oil. I'm making both.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.360]   In your family, maybe everybody hates that. Maybe just want to, you know, do sunflower oil or peanut
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.080]   oil or, you know, whatever. But the idea though is that, you know, taste isn't an issue. And the last
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.840]   part is the best saturation. So saturation kind of you saw from the part two is kind of a little bit
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:41.200]   all over the map too. And so, you know, it's the idea is is which one of these oils can hold in
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.200]   the most amount of C60. And right now, based on just what people have claimed, we know that it's
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.360]   a blend C60. The Champion 60 brand says that they have one milligram per milliliter and that's the
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:01.040]   highest. The red study was 0.8 milligrams per milliliter. So apparently one of these scientists
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.880]   have found a way to hold more. Now the carbon 60 guy, he just was on Sarah Westall. And he claims
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.600]   that he didn't say he didn't give the number. I did not reply to my email when I asked. But he's
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.280]   claiming in that interview with Sarah Westall that it's quote a lot and that his oil is black to prove
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:25.040]   it in terms of how much C60 is actually in the oil. And so that's his claim as to why, you know,
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.800]   I would assume this is assumption why his recommended doses are so low because he's saying that oh,
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.720]   my oil has more carbon 60 in it than other oils. So that and it real interesting good or bad.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.600]   I'm not judging here, but it's just something to think about. It is a consideration that you need
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.640]   to think about when it comes down to what oil are you going to use. The next consideration is the
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:53.120]   purity. Now, if you remember, this comes right out of section two of the video series that,
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.280]   you know, not all of the vendors are using the exact well, actually none of the vendors are using
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.880]   the same purity level of C60 powder that the rat study did. Rat study was 99.98 and the highest
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.840]   is 99.95 that's out there on the commercial market today all the way down to the lowest purity level
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.320]   that's for sale 99.90. And so which one are you going to use? And so what's the difference? Well,
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.160]   solvents, solvents, they use solvents. They're toxic. That's how they make the fullerenes,
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.120]   except for carbon 60 number nine, they say they don't use solvents. And so, you know, everyone's
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.240]   different apparently. But the idea here is that you want to keep that level down to the absolute
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:39.200]   lowest. That's why the scientists use 99.98. But if you go shopping, that's expensive. I mean,
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:45.520]   the better the purity, it's not just a little bit more. It's a lot more from low to medium to high.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:53.440]   And so for me personally, I'm going with the 99.95. These vendors went with 99.5. If you did the math,
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:02.000]   the difference between those two numbers, 99.95 and 99.99 is only 0.04%. That's it. That's
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.480]   that much more toxins are going to be in that in that powder as opposed to 99.99. That's four
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:15.600]   one hundredths. And the fact that C60 is what does it do? It's a super antioxidant. It removes
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.400]   toxins from your body. So I'm going to assume that that little bit of a difference is going to be
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.280]   easily taken care of by the C60 once I ingest it. And besides, for the last five months, I've
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:31.120]   been taking 99.95 anyway, because these are the vendors I bought from. So I think that's going to
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.400]   be something you need to think about. One more thing to think about. And a lot of it's the economics
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:42.880]   too. It's it's a money issue. Next one. Number four consideration on making your C60 oil at home is
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:49.360]   are you going to stir or are you going to shake? There are two alternatives. In my research, basically,
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:55.760]   there's most people are stirring. I did find one vendor that one of the manufacturers is actually
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:02.560]   using ultrasonic, you know, mixers to blend and dissolve their C60 in their oil. So there's
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.000]   different ways of doing it. I've been making vitamin C or liposomal vitamin C for many,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.040]   many years. And I use a jewelry cleaner, not a commercial one like that, but a smaller one.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:19.280]   And that's how that's made. So it's not new to the industry in terms of how to mix a water soluble
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:25.440]   powder into a fat. So you know, it's totally, totally reasonable to use this machine to do so.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.280]   So you don't just have to stir. You have an alternative if you want to go that way.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:35.120]   I plan on doing it both ways to kind of compare the two. So the thing that's most important though
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.640]   in this consideration is that, hey, if you stir, you stir, it takes two weeks. If you stick it in
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.040]   an ultrasonic cleaner, it can be as short as 100 minutes. And where I got that number was,
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:51.280]   but I went back to my original vitamin C research. And there's lots of different ways to make liposomal,
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:58.960]   but mostly there's a case for how long you leave it in the cleaner and anywhere from nine minutes
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:05.120]   to 100 minutes, right? So I'm going to err on the side of the maximum and say, okay, well, if
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:11.040]   I could make liposomal vitamin C and I can do so in 100 minutes, then I probably could make lipo
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.240]   fullerenes and do the same in 100 minutes using using an ultrasonic machine like this.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.960]   And then there's also the factor of number five heating. Do you want to heat the oil? Because,
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:26.320]   you know, common sense says if you're going to, let's say, take sugar and mix it into tea,
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.200]   that it's going to dissolve a lot better and a lot faster. If it's hot tea, then ice tea, right?
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:37.120]   Same thing with vitamin C 60 in oil. And so when you look at the study, you know,
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.680]   how did they do it in the study? Well, the study just says ambient temperature. And we know from
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.760]   another part in the study that the rats were kept in air conditioning. So you know, it's a lab. It's
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.200]   an air conditioning lab. So you know, it's probably like around 75, 76 degrees in the lab, most likely.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.160]   And that's what they that's what they mixed it. So they didn't heat it up. So maybe that's
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:01.120]   why it takes two weeks. You know, I'm just just I'm just guessing. But the idea here is I think
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:06.800]   that actually heating up the oil will do a better job at dissolving the C 60. And you know what,
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.800]   it may actually increase saturation. I don't know. I'm just guessing these are all things to
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.760]   consider, right? That's why it says considerations and not these are the facts. These are just
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.840]   considerations. So think about heating it now. And this is so I gave you some numbers here to think
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:24.800]   about. And that is based on the type of oil, they have a different smoke point. And that's
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.640]   where you don't even want to get near smoke point. Because if you do your research on oils,
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.520]   you know that the oils themselves become toxic. If you heat them up too high, right? So keep them
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.440]   well below the smoke point. And of course, if there's issues there with solidity, because you
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.600]   know, specifically coconut oil, coconut oil gets solid at 76. So, you know, one of the good
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   things about these little machines here is that they actually have our heaters too. And so they
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:52.320]   can heat you can heat them up. So the ultrasonic cleaner can you can turn that thing on and keep
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.560]   it as low as 68 degrees or crank it all the way up to 176 degrees, you know, the oil.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:03.920]   So that, you know, your mixture is warmer or hot while you're, you know, basically zapping it with
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:10.160]   with alter waves to mix up the solution. So that's something to think about. I like the idea of
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:14.720]   heating and that'll be definitely part of one of one of my future experiments. Now, number six
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:23.200]   consideration, even though Fati Musa said in the interview with c60.net that it wasn't necessary
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:29.120]   if you weren't doing a science study to filter in centrifuge. When it comes to filtering, here's
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.480]   something that I that I was thinking about was you're taking olive oil or whatever oil. You're
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.960]   putting it on the counter covering it up with something dark to keep it, you know, keep the light
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.440]   out and you're going to let that thing run for two weeks. And first of all, there's the whole
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.560]   issue of, you know, how sterile is your kitchen or wherever you're working. And is it possible
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.960]   that there's some bacteria floating around that could get inside that when you put the stop run
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:59.200]   and let it run. And so there's a consideration and depending on how concerned you are, you may want
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.320]   to consider even though Fati Musa said it wasn't necessary to go ahead and filter it anyway,
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:12.160]   because you can easily get a .22 micron filter. I did my research and it basically comes out and
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:17.200]   this is from Inspired Living, that bacteria range in size from .2 to 2 microns in width or
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.280]   diameter and from 1 to 10 microns in length for the non-spherical species. So for a one micron
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:31.520]   filter, right, it will remove most bacteria and cis. So if you get a .22 micron filter,
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.720]   okay, that's way smaller and you should be able to filter out the majority of anything that's
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   floating around your house. And that's just, you know, an observation. It's a consideration.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.360]   This is what the contraption looks like. It's a pump. You've got your, you put your oil up here
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.320]   in a container. The filter's right here in the middle and then you basically turn this pump on.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.720]   It's a vacuum. It just sucks the oil out of the top and into the bottom and that's how it passes
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.720]   through the filter. And you'll actually see that in a video I'll be talking about here in a bit.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.760]   But that's the idea. It's a consideration. Do you have to? The scientists said no.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.640]   Do you maybe want to? It's up to you. But for me, I'm definitely going to be filtering my oil.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:18.000]   And lastly, how much C-60 powder do you put into your oil? Because
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.160]   if you remember from the RAT study, how they made it? Now they made a claim that says, hey,
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.840]   we're going to put 50 milligrams. This is the RAT study, 50 milligrams, C-60 and 10 milliliters
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:33.280]   of oil. Okay, that's what they said. That was their recipe. And they said that their saturation
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:38.240]   rate was .8. Now that was a consistent .8 because they had to make sure every single batch matched
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:45.600]   the other batch, right? So now if their saturation was .8, that means there was 42 milligrams of C-60
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:53.520]   stuck to the bottom of the flask, on the sides of the flask, but 42 milligrams stayed behind.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.640]   And when they poured the oil out, only .8 milligrams left the flask that they were stirring in.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.880]   Well, you know, if you look at the math on this from the dollar numbers, if you're thinking,
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:10.720]   let's say if it's 100 bucks a gram and you put five grams in there, just to get .8 out of the oil,
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:17.920]   you're leaving 42 grams or, you know, I'm sorry, like 4.2 grams in the flask. That's good. That's
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:25.360]   $400. And so I don't, you know, so what I'm saying is like, you know, when you look at like what
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:32.480]   everybody's doing, and I mean, the manufacturers, and they're not putting five grams per 1,000 milliliters,
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:39.200]   they're usually putting in .8 grams or one whole gram per 1,000 milliliters, you know,
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:45.600]   to make their solution so that they're not throwing the C-60 full arenas away. And obviously,
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.960]   it's very expensive to throw it away. So the formula that I'm going with is I'm, if I know
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:58.560]   that .8 is the maximum saturation rate, then I'm only going to put .8 grams per liter 1,000 milliliters
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.440]   into the solution as, as we're on my starting point. So that's how much I'm going to put in,
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.400]   and that's how much a lot of different folks on the internet are doing is they're putting in about
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:16.000]   a gram or .8 grams per liter to come out with the saturation rate that was in the study. And so,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.400]   it's definitely a consideration because it could cost you a whole lot of money. If you just blindly
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:26.720]   follow the study, you'll be wasting hundreds of dollars in in full arenas. Now, let's take a look
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.720]   at the cost. This is the big, the slide everybody wants to know about. What's the cost do all this
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:39.360]   stuff? Well, here you go. Bottom line, subtotal, $119.33 just for the materials, just for the
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.400]   ingredients. The brand that I buy is Star Extra Virgin olive oil. I get it from Safeway. It's,
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.920]   I checked it out. It is certified. So it's only one liter. It's nine bucks. And then if I bought
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:55.200]   C-60 full arenas and I buy it by the gram, it's 110 bucks. Take a peek over here. The
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:02.560]   research shows that SES sells it for 135. But you can get one gram of 99.95 C-60 for 110
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.000]   if you just buy from a different vendor. So it's cheaper. I buy the lower cost amount. And so now,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:17.600]   it would only cost you and me $119.33 to make one liter 1000 milliliters batch of C-60 oil.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.440]   Now, of course, you're going to need some equipment to do so. So you need a glass flask and a
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.760]   topper. You need the magnetic stirrer and you need a filter kit, which is the filter of the bottle
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:31.280]   and the pump. And so all of that together, your subtotal on the equipment is so $108 and 24 cents.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.080]   So you put on 100 bucks for some equipment. You put 120 bucks out for the ingredients and boom,
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:41.520]   you can make yourself your first batch of C-60. Now, what does that compare? Well, it's pretty big
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:47.360]   number right there, $3.52 an ounce. That's what it's going to cost you. Okay, because at 119.33 per
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:54.880]   1000 milliliters and there's 33.814 ounces per liter, boom, that's your cost. And that doesn't
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.760]   include the equipment now. It's just the cost of the ingredients, but you could be buying, I'm sorry,
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:08.720]   making your own C-60 at home for $3.52 per ounce. And according to my pricing guide,
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.520]   is that a better deal or not? Obviously, it is. You can get it a lot cheaper. And if you're going
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:18.320]   to get seriously into this, you should seriously consider making your own C-60 at home,
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:24.320]   because the cost could just totally wipe you out. So, and one other thing too, for the
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:30.000]   accountants out there, according to GAP accounting principles, you know, any type of capital
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.400]   outlay on equipment is usually depreciated over 36 months. Your overall capital outlay
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:40.320]   depreciation costs would be $3.01 per month for 36 months. Add that into your formula for making
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:45.280]   your own. And it's nothing. It's not even enough to even worry about. So, let's just stick with
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.680]   $3.52 per ounce as the dollar amount. And don't worry about the 100 bucks to buy your stuff,
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.360]   because, you know, you're going to be using it over and over. But what really counts is the
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.560]   ingredients. And that is the number. And there you go. That is the end. So, but I do want to talk
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.720]   about one last thing before I go. And that is, there actually are a couple other considerations
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.920]   in my research that I came up with. And one of them is the power source. If you live in an area
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.520]   that is prone to power outages and you've got that thing stirring for two weeks,
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.880]   and if it turns off, it stops and you forgot about it or whatever and you're, you know,
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.560]   hey, you don't want to deal with it. So, if you have power issues, you might want to get an
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.120]   uninterruptible power supply like you would for your computer and plug your stir into that
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.560]   instead of the wall. Other things are noise levels. You know, this thing is, you know,
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:32.560]   depending on brands of stirs, they can get noisy. And I know that the ultrasonic cleaners are
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.800]   quite noisy. And so, you don't want this thing, if it's going to be sitting around for two weeks,
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.320]   you know, you don't want this thing sitting anywhere that is going to be bugging you because of the
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:45.200]   noise level and then of light. Light, as I mentioned earlier, it is so important to keep this thing
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:52.480]   dark. In fact, after you finish making it, it needs to stay dark. So, your storage issues are,
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:57.520]   you need to store in dark containers. It should be class. So, if you're not already saving your
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:02.160]   bottles from the manufacturers you're buying from, start saving them because you could reuse those
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:08.400]   bottles or another idea which is actually a better idea than just getting an amber bottle from a
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:14.080]   manufacturer is going and buying yourself a Myron glass bottle. You know, for a one-liter Myron
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:20.240]   glass bottle, it's about 14 bucks on Amazon. Very, very cheap. And what Myron is, it's a violet,
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:27.600]   it's a violet-colored bottle. It has special properties in the glass that protects it from UV.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:35.840]   And basically it's the best glass you could use to store anything that's sensitive to light. So,
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:41.840]   I actually have Myron bottles in my house and jars to keep things like my sprouting seeds because
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.000]   they're sensitive to light. I've got one that's just dedicated to my ormis so that I don't,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.520]   there's no light that's going to get to that. And I'm actually going to buy some Myron glass
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:57.840]   bottles to keep my C60 solutions in as well. I've got some leftover bottles from Purple Power
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:03.280]   that I'll be using as well because I saved my bottles. But it's always good that this is actually
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.720]   the best way to store it. And you know, you're spending 100 bucks on it. You might want to store
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.120]   it in the right container. And then of course, even if you get it, make sure you keep it dark,
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.600]   you know, so don't just leave it and leave it where it's dark. I've actually taken my other bottles
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.080]   and wrapped them in foil. Whatever you do, keep it dark. And the last consideration is if you have
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.480]   cats. And this is really important. If you have cats, you know that little bastards get in that
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.720]   room with your stir thing, they're going to knock it off the shelf. And that's a guaranteed, I could
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.720]   bet money on it. So watch out for those cats. The little bastards will knock everything off of
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:39.440]   your counters and they will definitely mess up your C60. So that's it. That's how to make C60
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:46.320]   at home. Now, oh, I'm sorry. One more thing. Right over here courtesy of Todd Olson below in my video
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:53.760]   is a video demonstration on everything I just said on how to make C60. So if you want to see how
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.000]   it's done, you know, I'm not going to recreate the wheel. The guy did a fantastic job of making
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.200]   the video. Please go ahead, go below, click on the link, watch his video. The guy's name is Todd
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:09.680]   Olson. And this video goes step by step, everything I just said on how to make C60 oil by spinning it
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:14.480]   around in a magnetic stir. And then you'll be able to visualize what I'm talking about.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.280]   Great video. Please click on it. And kudos to Todd. Thank you so much for making that video.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:25.120]   Saved me a lot of time. So back to this. Thank you very much, Mahalo Aloha. This ends the three
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.600]   video series. I may do an addendum. I'm not sure there's a lot of other things that popped in my
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:34.880]   head as I was doing this. But for right now, thank you. I really appreciate your time. Thank you for
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:41.040]   stopping by. I'm really glad I could share what I learn with everyone. Because I think together,
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.640]   we're all going to add to this body of work and this body of knowledge. And together,
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:51.920]   you know, we're going to all do well in our future. So hey, you know, great. Thanks a lot. Aloha. Bye.
