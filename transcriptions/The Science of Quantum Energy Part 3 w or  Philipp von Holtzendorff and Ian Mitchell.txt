[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Quontanoneji, the final frontier, these are the voyages of the stosh and BBQ, its five-year mission to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new energies and new frequencies, to boldly go where no non-binary, gender and neutral man has gone before.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   [Music]
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Captain, Commander. Welcome to the podcast. That is awesome. Amazing. [Laughter]
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   That is fantastic man, that's hysterical. I feel like it. Well you know you started working with NASA and this all kind of fit into the science of Quontanoneji.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   So hey I thought I thought I'd just give it a little bit of a different twist in your regular interviews.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Well you're off to a good start. [Laughter]
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Great, well I'm glad you like that. So hey you know let's just jump in. Everybody this is the third year we've done this video where we discussed the science of Quontanoneji and really approaching it and what I'd like to do today is really kind of just approach it with a bridge between mainstream science.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   You know academia, understanding of quantum mechanics etc. And then really what's happening because I see this as really just a whole new level of discovery about quantum that really hasn't you know really that's just really coming up now with all of these different studies you guys have been doing.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   So you know hey thank you very much for coming on the show. What I wanted to do though just let you folks out there listening is that there's been over 60 studies that have been completed now there's even more on the way where you know there's just been these incredible discoveries
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   about quantum energy from a whole different standpoint. Now I'm not going to ask the iron and fill up to repeat themselves. This has really been well documented. You can find all of the studies on various websites. You can find a summary of all the different studies on my web channel here on the benefits of quantum healing.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   There's lectures that Philip has done on his YouTube channel as well as different interviews and so what I'm going to be doing today is I'm going to just kind of you know let's just start talking with iron and fill up about
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   their findings as an add on to the last two couple of interviews I thought were really great guys you guys did a really great job with Luke's story and the wellness mama so
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   but you know just overall though everybody hey you know there's been some great discoveries with ATP production blood microscopy you know EMF food intolerances oxidative potential on substances or you know getting substances and wound healing so
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   if you want to know more about that that's the pre-work with it to this video I'll give you a bunch of links in the video description so let me just jump right in with the questions guys thank you so much for your time today.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   So the first question really is when you start when you're talking about quantum energy and I know you've been asked this a million times but I just wanted to level set something but I think it's really kind of important from an academic standpoint right is the idea of quantum
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   and quantum energy from your perspective you know are we still talking about quantum as in terms of the energy behind the subatomic particles you know from that perspective as shown on the screen are we still talking about that
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   when you are when you're talking about quantum yes we are and I want to and have you know you and I have spoken about this a bunch of times and certainly I and I have what we're doing is not quantum mechanics it has actually nothing to do with that quantum mechanics
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   it's a rabbit hole the people that are dealing with quantum physics right there's there's two layers well there's three layers there's the one layer of people that hear about quantum physics and they have no clue whatsoever what this even means right it's just the random people
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   then you have some that just work on it and they they just follow it without even understanding where this comes from and then you have the people and it's actually an Einstein model that that believe that consciousness can be created out of matter out of grit
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   right and that is the actual narrative of quantum physics and it is absolute BS okay it has nothing to do with the reality because everything is consciousness and matter always comes out of consciousness it is not the other way round it cannot be the other way round and it will never be the other way round
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   so that is the fundamental twist in this whole quantum mechanics and quantum physics world which most people don't understand that that even exists so begin with so that's why you know it doesn't matter too much for the vast majority of the people because they don't understand it anyway
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   they don't understand the one side nor the other side and and for them it just matters that something works but then even then it is important to understand that we work with the real deal
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   because if you look into the quantum physics you find a lot of stuff that's theory you don't find a lot of stuff that's actually working or even a model that you can literally use in practicality
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   so we work with the real deal what does that mean the energy comes out of the ether we're working with little source energy that is what we work with and if someone says yeah you're crazy that you work with source energy
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   no we're not crazy at all we're not claiming that we invented source energy of of course then we would be crazy source energy has always been there we have been able to do is to access that to find a way in how to access it
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   to harness it and to concentrate it and in that sense yes it is the energy behind the matter but it's literally the energy out of which everything happens materializes and exists
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   and I think that's at least important to make that statement
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   one thing I might add is that in kind of the normal human way we look at things from the outside in sometimes and if you look at medicine and science it's always taken the approach of truly working from the outside in because we are getting ever increasing
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   of granularity and we get to go into more and more and more depth as our technology increases and our ability to assess things experimentally increases and primarily with different instruments breakthroughs are made in terms of how granular we can be how detailed can we look at something
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   you know electron microscope you know if you gave that to you know von Leibwenhoek his socks would blow off you know it's a it's one of those things like reality works in the outside in a lot of times you know people think they're a body first and a consciousness second so you know there's been a lot of study done on what is the seat of consciousness where in in the body is consciousness and it's never been able to be isolated and it can't be found in fact even
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   a couple weeks ago in the mensibles and there was a bit about how they were trying to isolate the source of particular thought and they couldn't they weren't able to now can they correlate certain brain regions sure but that's a mechanistic approach after the fact
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   very often thinking of people as things and not more of a manifestation of the underlying consciousness which is you know exactly what Philip was saying is consciousness first material reality second not the other way around
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   you aren't conscious because you have a body you have a body because you're conscious okay so the so in other words you guys are sort of kind of laying down the foundation right of a new understanding of quantum being that
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   not it's not to the Einsteinian model whereas you know Einstein's you know basically taught all of us that energy can only exist with matter you know moving really quickly right that is the definition of energy but now you've taken it to that lower level below that it says hey no actually consciousness creates
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   you know consciousness does it consciousness manifests creates or it you know how would you describe like where does how does consciousness create that reality
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   out of consciousness everything everything that exists comes from consciousness you can say it that way and how consciousness does that it's just
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   you can't even define that with words it just happens it you know but there is still highest intelligence behind it that's that's definitely something and we're also not reinventing anything or so it's just
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   where we're just talking about things how they are and Nikola Tesla for example had the very same understanding that you know that and and and you know what so if the ones that have that understanding those are the ones
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   that actually come up with real inventions the things that you can really apply with things that really move the needle and look at what Nikola Tesla invented it's quite remarkable and
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   yeah so it's nothing new it's it's rather something very ancient that you know I don't know where maybe the narrative the official narrative has changed a little bit for whatever reason and walls are not here to change that right we don't need to convince anyone but but if you ask us you know then then we certainly need to make clear
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   how we see it and then how we even get to this energy right now yeah no thanks yeah thanks for that I'm sorry good I am no I was just gonna say and we're not trying to negate you know I mean quantum quantum theory has given us lots of groovy stuff you know quantum electrodynamics is probably the most accurate theory ever devised in you know physical reality and I mean there's some really really great things that guys like Feynman Einstein have done and I don't think we're really approaching that this is this is a bit different
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   than that it's not looking at the met the mechanistic aspects of how particles are moving or waves that become particles are moving it's one level below that you know the manifestation and truly I think that for me kind of there's I very much love it when you find an experimental physicist because those guys are actually testing things to see what the veracity
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   of the claims are and like can we prove it can it actually work and sometimes it works and you get really neat predictions and then you can actually use those two you know like make CD players and use a laser and do all kinds of cool stuff
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   but then other times you know you'll end up with a bit of a boondoggle where you've got you know multi-string theory and you know so where you've got guys like Minty Okaku and Roger Penrose kind of in a death match because they each have different approaches on how things are working and they can't reach any definitive conclusion but for me a lot of the time it doesn't so much matter if we can help people biologically by doing something
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   that's enough of a proof right if we can yeah we can demonstrably show that there is a Dennis great then then we're doing our job or at least I'd say that's you know I'm doing my job
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I think you know honestly is like you guys have a have you come up with a term yet because you're doing you know this is really a whole new theoretical model of quantum where it embraces consciousness and it makes a lot of sense to me but I'm just wondering have you have you come up with a terminology yet for that
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   because you actually have your own branch at this point you know of understanding the how the universe works I think there have been you know like the Hindu Vedas I mean they're six thousand plus years old and if you read some of those things
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   oh my gosh you with sutras is kind of like the children's manual for how a human is made I think they're far sharper far wiser guys in antiquity that actually put a lot of this stuff together you know hence terms that are not shocking like the atmos you know which is literally the equivalent of an atom and that you know that's stuff that crept in six thousand years ago and when asked where they got that information from you know the people who wrote that down
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   the the rishis who were the seers they just said you know they they kind of intuited it you know or in some cases it was passed on to them from people before them
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   and I don't know that we're really doing anything that new I think we're rediscovering technology that has probably been in higher and more frequently and widely used formats thousands of years ago that's just my hunch because I see too many things
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   that are peculiar that don't line up with us being the penultimate technological society that the world has ever known
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   and I get it because you know like that most recent electron microscope picture of entangled protons turns out to be the union gang I mean that was like if that's not a wake up call the ancient students a lot more than we give them credit for that was a big thing that is such a great that's perfect that's perfect that's it's literally straight up but you're yang for entangled photons
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   okay yeah I'm sure that's just happenstance yeah I just okay cool so okay so this is where we're gonna this is our our where we're starting from folks out there
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   and so now one of the things too that you guys did talk about with the wellness mom when she asked you you know like what is charging mean so I kind of wanted to kind of share with everybody when you guys talk about charging
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   you know I look at it like you're modifying the quantum potential of whatever it is you're charging whether it's a organic or inorganic substance but you're actually modifying that quantum potential which I know in academics you know that has a different definition
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   but it seems to be an applicable term because to me everything has a quantum potential and it's your consciousness is that correct that how you know on how that manifests is that was that be a good way of looking at it
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   I think so yeah I would actually say that yes that's a very good way of looking at it and the degree of you know the degree of development of you know a creature's consciousness dictates how much access to quantum energy they can muster and direct and shift and tweak
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   you know God is not an idiot the universe is not foolish it does not give toddlers pistols so I think I think we're kind of a self-limiting and based on how much kindness and love and goodness we sort of muster as individual creatures
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I think that's actually the primary gating function in terms of how much access we have to to all the things that we can either use for the benefit of other people or to the detriment of other people
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Okay so now in these studies and all of the different studies there's always this difference between either being "charged" right something was charged meant that it was put into the middle of this of a block one of the various different blocks this is an infinity block out there folks if you don't know what it is
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   and also being exposed to the field now I took this toroidal field gift as an example and I do have a question Phillip is is this kind of what when let's say people who can see this energy is this the shape of a field
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   because I'm just taking it from nature I mean everything in nature is a toroidal field right so is this kind of what it looks like and what's the difference between being in the middle versus in the field outside of the block
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   in terms of you know like because all your studies have different ways people have exposed it you know exposed things so but what is the difference and is there one
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Yeah so it actually we don't see a toroidal field if you look at the blocks it's more a quantum sun that doesn't have like a north or south where it's you know here you kind of have that right so it's more really going out into all directions at the same time
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   but literally at the very same time and maybe you somewhat close to a toroidal field but not not exactly that way and yeah so the the difference is really you know if you think of being in the sun
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   like literally being in the sun versus being here and being in the sunshine okay two different things okay so it's kind of so would you describe it more as like an arc field
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Yes I think that that would make sense just for what it's worth if I had to take a wild guess at this one I would say if you thought of it more as a cornucopia inverted on the top so that the small portion were farther away
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   and the larger portion opened up to the top plate and then exiting at the bottom just for sake of random direction you'd have the inverse of that cornucopia folding down moving away from opposite corners
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Okay, just type with me so like a centripetal and centrifugal vortexes are exactly connecting in the connecting right okay with higher reality yet okay okay so that's like Lord Kelvin's atomic vortex theory
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   sort of right yeah or Walter Russell's or yeah yeah there've been some that have popped up I that would be okay if I had to just hazard a guess I would say it would probably be similar to that and then as Philip said
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   as Philip said radiating from the center of the thing with the center being the most intense focus outward in all directions from that okay okay all right so everybody there's gonna be a quiz afterwards
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   No that's fast I'm just one of those people I just want to know you know I just really want to know because I just find all of this fast I mean the results from the studies defy every conventional physics things I've ever been taught
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   and I know it's happening because it's all double blind multi I mean it's just there's this you're you're doing everything by the gold standard of studies right and analysis and we're and you're discovering stuff that just hasn't happened before or not in our current modern day
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   understanding so now one of the other things I do want to chat about is the frequency aspect now there's only been a couple of studies that I'm aware of where there was frequencies involved one of them being with the heel capsule
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   I think Bessa or iGAF was studying that one and then also with the autism study where they use the focus frequency
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   and so when you talk when we're talking about frequencies you know and several just to add and multiple based studies as well in regards to specific frequencies mentioning for example just the latest ones where they studied the heel 360
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   as well as the pain management there were a lot of others that they also checked in the past
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   oh no that's great thanks for reminding me I forgot about those two new ones okay so you know like I was trying to explain to someone in a telegram chat group about the concept of frequencies
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   and I just kind of defaulted to the standard concept of you know in standard physics right there's the theory of the quantum memory matrix and then the concept of quantum and printing
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   you know from one quantum information from one quantum object to another via the matrix is that the right explanation or how do you like when it comes to the frequencies themselves
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   and and you know that are first first question frequencies exist are they carried by the quantum energy first question and the second question would be is copying and when they copy over is it literally quantum and printing
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   you're moving information from you're copying it to you know from one thing to another go I'm sorry go ahead please
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   so all frequencies that exist exist within the quantum field and that literally includes all of the frequencies but whether that's a vitamin C frequency sound frequency
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   arrived machine frequency scalar energy which is that is also just a frequency band that exists within the quantum field so the quantum field you can think of as literally the base layer or the umbrella and within that all of these different frequencies exist
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   now certainly and we've talked about this before the quantum energy itself since everything is vibration and you know that means frequency basically also the quantum field is vibrating right so it sort of is also frequency
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   but to make that distinction we say well we rather call this the base layer or the quantum energy which is sort of neutral and then if it comes to specific frequencies we talk about those
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   now so the quantum field if you put something in a highly concentrated quantum energy field frequency then it automatically copies into anything else that you have in there in the same field right so in the block that's
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   basically what happens because there's it's entangled it's just by nature it's it's automatically entangled it may take a few seconds but it's it's very quick
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   and I'm sorry I probably lost now one of the questions if you could just repeat what I didn't answer here but maybe I'm going too fast no the first one was you know like well I guess the first question really was around you know freak
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   I'm sorry I also I think I forgot my question I'm thinking I'm thinking as you're talking I'm like active listening here and I forgot my own question but it really just but it's really just trying to explain to someone you know what is copying a frequency
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   you know how do you take the frequency like you know you had an example I am in your interview where you're talking about milk and sage right putting in a quantum block and the milk will pick up the flavor of sage if you put the two in together
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   how does that I mean and I was thinking that it's just you're imprinting it you're imprinting the signature it's a quantum signature right onto another item and then now that the other item now contains both signatures I guess is it
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   yeah that's exactly how it is okay yeah okay okay one thing about that is there was kind of on a macroscopic not not a quantum scale but on a macroscopic field there was an interesting study done a couple years ago with horses so there was
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   kind of equine study about how people's emotional states were impacted around horses and one of the really peculiar things they did is they had people hooked up to an EEG and they had a horse hooked up to an EEG
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   and and you've probably seen the study the the horses brainwaves and cardiac rhythms all synced up with the person who was approaching them before there was any physical contact when they were just in proximity
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   they would think and you know which is I think probably why any anybody who's around horses realizes that if you're nervous the horse gets nervous if your horse is calm
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   and it's you know and it's kind of a high stakes event because they're you know 1,200 pounds of their their big critters but but it's when you're in that field there is a particular vibration and you know you say like the idea of a of a vibratory conveyance of information for sage
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   well it has a specific field it's very complex and there are a lot of different components that go into making something tastes like sage but you can just for the sake of verbal communication boil it down to the vibratory frequency
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   is it a frequency yeah in a sense but it's also a very complicated multifaceted frequency but we know that the same thing applies with ponies because you can walk up to one and it will for all intents and purposes mimic the field of the person
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   different thing you know obviously flavor and emotion but you know that's for all intents and purposes a person operating in a certain frequency
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   yeah no you're spot on I'm a I'm actually an old barn dad daughters in a question spent countless hours of my life around horses and I you know I've seen it firsthand and in fact every question you'll ever talk to you they know they know exactly what you just said because the horse will sync up with you
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   and you'll if you have a bad day you're you're gonna have a bad ride
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   hundred percent yeah cool okay this that makes sense now you did mention quantum entanglement fill up so now what I kind of want to understand is like you've you've also quoted in several interviews you know the 2022 Nobel Prize for the discovery of quantum
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   or the recognition of quantum entanglement you know from a academic standpoint but you know when you look at that study you know they I think it was a they split two protons split them up miles apart and then they observe both protons but those were
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   you know they were talking about you know the entanglement of particles that belonged to each other so they had each they had the same signature and then they got split apart by distance and then that's how they proved it but
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   but you know when we look at the quantum upgrade service or we look at let's say putting a picture in a block
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   there's no you know there's no connection there I mean there's they're they're not part of the same it's not like I'm putting my DNA in the block and my DNA is my antenna to the rest of my DNA
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   you know somewhere else but so we're just taking in information you're just correct what's your birthday what's your name where you live
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   and then all of a sudden you're entangled how do you how do you like what's how do you explain that but that it's it's not particle based but it's still entanglement
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   what's brings us to the very first question and by the way you can you could use DNA as you know you know you know you can use a hair or you know something a piece of skin or something and it would still work
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   but then you know we would probably be talking about particle even though it still goes back to the energy signature but the fundamental point here is that
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   again here there's a Nobel Prize which great you know it drives awareness for this topic that there's more than we thought there is right but it's but they they operate under this assumption
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   that a particle is the smallest piece in the whole puzzle right it always goes down to okay smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller particle but that's just not the truth
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   the smallest and the layer below it is just energy and not a particle and so the real deal is actually if you can do quantum entanglement with energy with the energy signature and yeah and the end of the day may not even matter to most people right but it's
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   it's still if you think about it that consciousness is the base layer and it's not just a particle we're not we're not there isn't just matter that is so important and we
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   we have just a we just work with a real deal if that makes sense so I don't know if they were whatever they did it in their modeling could ever do this they probably couldn't do any of this
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   yeah because that's kind of the way I was trying to explain it as well is this is the idea that you consciously identify right you believe your consciousness is absorbed by the idea that you are your name this is your birthday you do live here
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   which makes it like let's say there's three different people with the same name in my town but each one of us are uniquely different because we know and we constantly accept ourselves as a different entity from the other
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   but by just by that identification just by that self identification of who I am that consciousness reach into the reaches into the field and then the information that you have that you're broadcasting that energy from is going to find me in that field
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   because of that conscious connection is that correct I mean that's kind of how it works yeah okay that's so wild I mean it's so wild that you put a name you write a name down and you could put it in a block and that the energy will find that person somewhere in the world
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   or do you need more than just a name well you it kind of it depends because there's a little bit more to it so usually you need more than a name for example for the quantum upgrade certainly you know we we really did a lot of testing and we also wanted to make sure that
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   a John Smith for example is always covered right because there's multiple John Smith yeah and you need to be certainly you may even find some of the John Smith living in the same country or city or whatever right so you need to make sure it really is the correct one that's why we have a bunch of information
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   that that goes beyond just the name so that's that's quite important okay iron what's your take on this well my take is that it we're looking at a
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   the universe is one entire waveform that's conscious and we are very small little fragmented bits of that whose awareness is very safely and kindly gated off so that we perceive things like time and moving through it
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   forward and that you can't the idea that something could be separate from everything else is sort of an inviolate principle like you it's just not going to happen
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   I think that's why you know jumping back to the Nobel Prize that's why that was so interesting is to very very much show that reality for all intents and purposes is non-local you know that distance and space don't really matter
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   and I would posit that one of the one of the misconceptions about looking at that in physics is people think of things as being separate and I think that's illusory I think that's actually wrong I don't think there's any separation
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   in fact I think anything that's a product of going through a big bang is for all intents and purposes quantumly entangled everything everything this entire universe is quantumly entangled and just through a very nifty trick of
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   perception gaining we are broken apart to think that we are in fact separate and to think that we have things that are distinct objects it's kind of like if you have a dream and I know everybody dreams
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   and in your dream you're not the only character you're not the only thing there are other objects there are other settings there's plots there's people there's things happening
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   when you wake up all of that is something that you are cognitively aware of and you go oh I had a dream and in all of these different characters and settings
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   well I would posit that that's probably not too different from the large field that we're in currently it's just we haven't woken up yet
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   which which gets a bit esoteric I know but you know from the the physics of it when you can definitively show that things truly are non-local in space isn't a constraint
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   it kind of does tend that one would have to reason out that we are part of a very complex waveform and so things like a unique identifier
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   well no one has to tell you that you're looking at your thumb you know it's your thumb because you are the totality of your thumb and everything else right and I think when we're tapping into things like the quantum
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   we assume as people that we have to tell it a lot more than we probably do because one of the things that's blown me away in the experiments that we've done is in a double blinded setting it always works and that is mind bogglingly mind
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   that was the data the thing that I would always end with is just tell people to be kind because obviously with the data that we were seeing
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   if you can set up a wave and it propagates freely throughout everything everywhere to simply be nice you know it's going to have an impact
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   that makes sense. Hey, you know, go ahead, sir. Yeah, it's just I think this is really important with what I just said and I wanted to just mention something that in probably five to ten years, we won't have to do a lot of explaining anymore and I don't know how long it takes but
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   it's what we're talking about and what we're doing is it's so natural to our existence actually that we will all move into it again. It's just, we're moving out of a time when we're moving out of a time when we're
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   this actually that we will all move into it again. It's just we're moving out of a time where this knowledge, this axis, the truth about what and who we really are was widely forgotten, right? And now this will, this is coming to the surface again
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   and if we're not doing it, someone else is going to do it and there will be a lot of other people and a lot of other companies that will do all kinds of stuff that's going to be new and in five to ten years, we won't have to do a lot of explaining
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   anymore because it'll be just so logical actually. Right now it's not logical, it's just because we, it's such a new concept to us, if that makes sense.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   No, that makes sense, absolutely. I'm old enough to remember like when my family got the first color TV in our neighborhood and everyone would come over and watch it, you know, and everybody was just aghast
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Oh my gosh, it's color TV. And then everyone was trying to understand like, how did color, you know, how did they make color? You know, it was just, and then now it's like, you know, nobody even thinks about stuff like that.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Nor do they question it. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Same with the internet, right? So I remember I was, I was actually involved very, very early in during the internet times and then, and I was actually in the US and then I came back to Germany
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   and they were way behind, right? And for me, it was already clear. Everyone is going to, most everyone is going to have an email at some point. And all these different applications, people will have phones where they'll use the internet and all of that.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   And in Germany, people would tell me, well, that's all crap. Like, what do I need email for? I can write postcards. I can write letters. I, you know, I don't need that. I will never use that.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   And, and people also said, I will never use it for this or for that. And it will never be on the phone. It's way too slow and all of that. And it's, it shows just the limits people have with something like that, because they can't imagine that, that now that you have access to a certain technology,
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   you'll also have a lot of interesting developments, right? So that it doesn't, doesn't stay awards at, if that makes sense. And we're with what we're doing again at the forefront of technology in a way. Now, it's a different thing.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   It's not for communication per se, but it's the same thing. It's just that in the beginning, just people don't get it. People even try to avoid it and talk it bad and no one needs it and it doesn't work.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   But then suddenly they realize the value of it and, and, and how cool it is that you could suddenly access that.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   No, totally, totally cool. So now here, let me ask you guys about the studies, the results of the studies. And, and I just had this general question because when I was studying the studies, and I, and I actually was digging into each one of the things on the right, which are the results of studies.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   And, and the results that they're, you know, that are produced when items, different stuff is being exposed to quantum energy. And I looked at each one of these things and it kind of like each one of them is driven.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   Let's say, like, like wound healing is driven by an increase in ATP, right, as an example. And so I'm just kind of wondering, like, you know, from your perspective, when something has, and I'm just using my terminology right now, when something is modified, you know, like, it's quantum
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   potentials modified by exposure to quantum energy and frequency.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Is there a, like a domino effect and that's what's producing results, or are the results just spontaneously happening because of the exposure? And what I mean by that is, like in your oxidative potential experiment, you know, you're discovering that, you know, like basically in organic substances such as zinc and vitamin C and so forth.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   You know, there, there, there's a, they actually are being modified.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   And because they're being modified, and if it's inside your body, then it triggers other changes, or the somatic response, like you saw in the emoto experiments where there's a somatic response to the energy.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   And if you take that, and you say, well, if that happens to water in that experiment, then all my intercellular water is also having that somatic response.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   And because of that somatic response, then it's driving other results, or just driving other processes.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Is that sort of like, you know, what you, I mean, just theoretically, like, you know, like, how are these results happening?
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   Is it a one step process, or is there just a baseline set of things changing, right, this, this or section here on the left?
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   It does, because those baseline things are changing, it's driving the rest of the results.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   So is that, I mean, which way do you guys see this as, you know, as how results are happening, or is it just consciousness?
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   So what do you think, guys?
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   So from my perspective, it's, well, it's for me, it's both, right, but there is, there's an initial strong effect that just happens because of it.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   And then, then you have domino effects as well.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   That's how I see it at least, and I feel free to, you know, put in your perspective.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Yeah, I think it's definitively both, but I think what's really happening in terms of how it helps you.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   I think if you look at DNA, it's effectively a string, right, a tuned string that has a specific frequency.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   And I think when you increase the amplitude of a person's own inherent frequency from their own genetic profile and all of their epigenetic profile, it basically makes the sound that they emit the volume of that person in totality louder.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   And so all of the things that are detractors start to get muted, you're basically able to increase the signal strength so you up the signal from the noise.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   And I think in great part, and this is just my theory, I think in great part, that's why so many of the things we see where, you know, the symptoms are ameliorated by virtue of just putting on a helocapsor, putting your hand in a block or something like that, you increase the volume of that person.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   And hence the tracking signals fade in comparison.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Okay, no, it makes sense. So yeah, okay, so thanks for that explanation.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   It's starting all make sense now on how all this stuff works and the results that we're seeing are just remarkable.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   So I do have a question though, and I believe this came up with your discussion with Sarah Westall.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   And in terms of specifically the oxidative potential experiments, and how you had mentioned that depending on what the substance was, the results you were getting were different, but no matter what the difference was always conducive
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   towards greater biological effect or a more harmonious effect on, you know, especially I guess on the food intolerance with, you know, study.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   And so that sort of, you know, like, you know, Sarah kind of went off and question whether, you know, if she took a religious stance to it, I look at it as, you know, like, I just think of it as an, there's an intelligent design pattern.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   We all know it exists, Fibonacci, Golden Mean, you know, all that stuff, it's all related, you know, there's this, there's this intelligent design called nature, and it's an amazing, you see it in the cosmos and you see it all the way down to a snail.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   And so is that, you know, like happening, you know, when you see all those different results, you know, depending on the different substance.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   But they're all that they're all going to be the same thing, you know, they're all going to have the same result, which is going to be, you know, higher intolerance for, you know, higher tolerance for food that causes problems for people.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   I mean, is there, is that an intelligent design process happening there, guys, or is it possibly simulation theory because, you know, it could go either way, right?
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Because simulation theory would just simply say, well, you've just adjusted the code on the simulation, and that the information that's contained in quantum energy, that it's literally, you know, information on code and you tweak the code.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   And the frequency is the language of the code, and or if it's intelligent design and you're looking at nature, I mean, what's your guy, you know, what's your take on that?
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Because I found it remarkable that you were getting, you know, you were getting different results, you know, but it still did the same thing.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   Yes, no, I think it's a great point, and I've seen your three-part video series too in regards to that, where you also bring up the simulation theory.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   And from my perspective, if we're just looking from our 3D point of view, it doesn't really matter whether it's just overall intelligent design or simulation.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   And you're just basically using a piece of source energy, right, if you will, to promote certain changes, both can be possible from this point of view, if that makes sense, right?
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   It doesn't even, I don't even see it as anything way different here. From this perspective, it wouldn't even matter. Yeah, maybe it's a simulation. Yeah, maybe it is not.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   But the effects are the same. You're using something that can override something that's energetically harmful, for example, and it just neutralizes it.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   And now from an overall perspective, I would say, to me personally, it doesn't even matter, because somehow it is a simulation, but somehow it's just also just expression, because it's the expression of consciousness.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   Now we're getting into a round where we're way beyond the 3D level. And the question is, does that help us now in understanding all of this a little bit better? If that makes sense. So from my perspective, from this 3D perspective, it doesn't matter. Both can be the case.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   From mine, I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive. If there is an overarching simulation, it's certainly going to possess a great degree of intelligence, and hence anything it designs will be highly intelligent, and thus represent of inherent intelligent design.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   For me personally, the simulation theory is kind of interesting, because it's really just a recapitulation and modern terminology of the same thing that you see in so many different spiritual and religious disciplines over the past few millennia.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   That it's just a different way of stating the same thing, you know, really, really down the stream, or, you know, merely, merely, merely life is but a dream, it's kind of, or gently down the stream, rather.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   It's one of those things that, okay, if life is a dream, then that's effectively a giant simulation, you know, and things would express in the same non-local capacities where if you're not looking at it, it doesn't exist. Why? Because it doesn't need to.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   That would be a waste of energy, and hence, you know, the universe being very efficient, wouldn't waste the energy.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   I think everything is intelligently designed. That's just a matter of where we are.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   For me personally, I think it doesn't matter. The things that I try and focus on are, you know, how do we help the people while we're here?
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   This used to be my big beef with philosophy versus, say, meditation. Philosophy seemed to be mentally gnashing over thing and kind of trying to figure out different ways to recapitulate and, you know, pontificate on this theory and that theory.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   And ultimately, I found it frustrating because I didn't think that people were actually trying to solve for a specific thing, you know, to solve the equation to figure out how can we make things better, how can we move things forward.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   Meditation was kind of agnostic in a lot of ways, but I noticed that there were inherent benefits, and at the end of it, I had an entirely different set of capacities, so I focused more on the practical, tangible aspects of things like meditating and breathwork and things to expand my cognitive capacity
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   and lieu of focusing on philosophical bantering about what is or what might be. It's kind of irrelevant to me. I mean, we're here.
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   I think it's incumbent upon us to help the other people are here and do things in the best capacity possible because we're a thousand part machine trying to understand a hundred trillion part machine.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   I don't know that we're really going to be able to grasp everything that's there.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   Yeah. Yeah. You know, that's a great way of looking at it. I was just, you know, I was trying to kind of address the debate and I think your perspective is spot on.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   You know, there's clearly an overarching intelligent design in nature and all of this quantum energy that you're experiencing and that you guys have brought to the market and the results that we're seeing from studies.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   It just seems like every single case, every single study, it just defaults back to this harmonious intelligent design of nature, and so that every time you're exposed to the energy or the frequency, you're just harmonizing with what should be, you know, which is the perfect state that nature has given us.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   So, yeah, totally. So now, another, go ahead. Just one other thing that's ultimately very important to me.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   I think also when you look at the world of intelligent design and you see it pervading through everything, I also see a great degree of humor.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   Anybody who's ever looked at a penguin and doesn't laugh a little bit. That's also brilliantly designed to flightless waterfowl.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   It's intrinsically comical and, you know, that's, if I were building in a universe, it would be a lot like that every now and see something utterly.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Yeah, I think they're still trying to debug the code that created the platypus.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   You know, in Chinese word word.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   And to add to that, and I love this discussion. So, in a way, what we can do and what we can all each individually contribute to our own lives and to the greater perspective is to evolve in our own consciousness, right?
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   And to get deeper and more expanded into who and what we are. And as we're doing that, we will just naturally understand more of everything.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   And we also in this process can let go of quote unquote negative or low vibrational energies and blockages and all of that that we have within you that within us that that draw in these more negative things if that makes sense.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   That's what Dr Hawkins called the attractor field. And it's so true. This is exactly how the universe works. You know, if I vibrate in fear and if I'm in fear, then that's pretty much also what I'm calling in.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   And, you know, if I vibrate in unconditional love or enjoy, then suddenly I crawl in different things and certain things don't even apply to you anymore. At some point, they don't, you know, you could, if you're in complete inner peace in complete inner peace, you could walk through a war zone.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   And nothing is going to hit you because you have no resonance to that. Okay, so you may not even end up in this war zone to begin with right because you're so in inner peace, but it really is.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   Okay, how can we change our own vibrational states and that's, that's one of the big tricks in this call it matrix call it, you know, or world that we play in here.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   It's one of the big tricks, right, that you can change your own vibrational state. And as you do that, you call in different things that you actually want to also see in your life.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   And it's just we're not taught that. Right. And so it's such a new concept that most don't, don't buy into this, don't believe it, whatever, but the ones that do and tested and try it out, they, they know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   And, and so that's the big trick. Like, it comes back to what I said, you know, be kind. If you, if you're kind, and in the really in the inside your kind, you're also inviting kindness into your life.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   Oh yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I couldn't agree more. Now, before we go, I just was wondering if you guys could share some of the stuff that's on the horizon. I know Philip, you've kind of dropped in some teasers in the telegram chat group, but just the idea of, you know, the current studies that are underway.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   The one if you, if you don't mind sharing with, with us is like, you know, the discoveries of the animal health study that's underway right now.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   And what you're finding. Yes. Because I, with working with animals just right off the bat, it eliminates that whole placebo concept. And so, you know, we're, when you're working with animals, there's no placebo.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   There's no observer effect. It's just the animals and that's, you know, and, and to me, that's the ultimate way of learning is that when you take the human out. So, what are you finding out in those studies right now?
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   It's an incredible study run by the Basa Institute at the moment in Austria has been going on for a while with 26 animals, a control group and a treated group.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   And they do lifeblood analysis.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   As a second measure, they use the Basa method. And on top of that, there's two more things. One aspect is two veterinarians that are actually one of them is probably the most published veterinarian in all of Austria.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   She's published, I don't know, 14, 15 books. She's very well recognized. There are, I would call it Western medicine oriented veterinarian. So, call them more mainstream, right? So they, they're, they don't know anything really about quantum or bad and energy devices and all of that.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   And that's very interesting, right, because they're, they're using their traditional diagnostics methods.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   They're looking at the animals, they're diagnosing what they have. And then they, you know, the technology is being applied and they report what is happening just in their regular veterinarian terms.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   And then the fourth part of it is that the owners of the animals are also being surveyed before and then, you know, during this study and what is happening all of that.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   And some absolutely amazing things have happened already. One that was just the most heartwarming story of a dog that was half paralyzed.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   And they actually, the veterinarians wanted to put the down dog basically, you know, I killed the dog because it was just in such a state where it's not worth living and you know what I mean, like they, they, it just wouldn't make any sense.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   Well, let's just give it a shot, right, you know, and then I can't remember they told me it'll be in the study then how long they applied the quantum upgrade in this case, but this dog suddenly started running again.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   And in the moment where that breakthrough happened, that dog ran in circles for minutes, literally, I have a video of that, ran in circles and would not stop and would not stop as it was such a burst of energy.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   And, and it was coupled with this, the surprise and the excitement and the happiness of this dog that he could suddenly run and fully move everything again.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   It's just absolutely remarkable. And so that happened. And that was also the first moment where these veterinarians started to be quite humble and said, wow, this is, this is quite remarkable.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   We may not understand how this works, but this works, right, and there's more to it. There's, yeah, I hope, and I'm pretty confident that the study will be completed by the beginning of November and hopefully already in October and will certainly share the results.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   I'm really looking forward to that. In addition, we're moving into brain coherence testing and Dr. Drew Pearson did some initial testing, you know, that's not statistically significant by any means at this point yet, but he found already some remarkable changes.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   In this case, that was with the travel blog, he sent me a picture I think I posted it also in the group. And, yeah, that was very remarkable. Right. I mean, so if this finding continues that would be huge, for sure.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   I would expect it to continue like that to be honest, but we don't have more data, then there's another study that's about to start in regards to a women's fertility that's actually quite a big study.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   Another one looks into the cell danger response and mitochondrial function. Different from what we've, what we've done so far and that's a special. It's a company called me screen that has developed a special testing technique, which is quite interesting.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   And that is starting next week. I think we're, yeah, there's, there's lots of stuff going on right now. I don't even, I almost can't keep track right now.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   But yeah, there's a lot coming. Oh, that's, that's really great to hear about the cell danger response. I just came up in our chat group and there was, we're wondering, you know, like if the increase in ATP, that's, that's a result of the quantum energy, you know, an ATP and in a cell danger response, apparently, is negative, then, you know, would that affect things and my answer was, well, everything's always going to end up harmonious one way or another.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   So I don't think so, but now we're going to have a study. So, all right. Okay, I have one more question before we, before we wrap up. You know, you guys were not you guys, but Philip, you continually produce products that have a stronger level of energy.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   And so my, my question is, is, are you guys ever seeing a difference in results based on the energy of the object or the block used or the, you know, the energy level of the upgrade, you know, like the booster at 2200.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   I mean, are there different results because the energy is higher?
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   You know, are you guys looked into that at all? Because I know why you're putting out higher energy objects, you've explained that in interviews, but I'm just wondering from a, from a study standpoint.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   Are you guys seeing different results by using a stronger block versus a, you know, an earlier generation?
[00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   Well, yes. So one is my personal experience and my observation that is that it really depends, right, because it depends on where the person is at.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   If I take someone that is totally new to a high vibratory environment and hasn't used the blocks before, for example, has maybe not even ever meditated lives on a healthy life.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   And I blast them with a 2200 booster for a while.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   I don't think they're going to do that great. You, you will probably kickstart a lot of positive changes, but I don't know if they're going to feel that great because they will probably have detox effects and all that kind of stuff.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   Now, for me, if I play a tennis match, I'm going to go full on for 2200 for 180 minutes. If I need to play for three hours in the heat.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   I do that. And I know this helps me a lot more than if I put it on 1000 400. I just know it. It just helps me so much more by my, I'm also very used to this.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   And I can, I already vibrate it quite high level if I don't even set it. So I need these high levels to get a lot extra kick, if that makes sense.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   So in these studies, it's extremely hard for us to test all these different levels and also even test all these different frequencies because all these studies are, they're also complicated.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   Right? It's, it's not just that you can do it all the time. And it's also not, you know, there's always a lot of time involved. There's money involved and all of that.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   And, and we just don't have the bandwidth to test everything. So what we do usually, you know, with a quantum upgrade, we, we, we test on certain levels.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   So I, I think the, the, the ATP production studies were done pretty much between the levels of 800 to 1000. If I'm not mistaken, and the wood healing experiments.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   Similarly, maybe they went up to. Yeah, I think around that, more or less. And then the base institute, I think, I don't know which levels they use, but they document the levels.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   So, so it's usually that they, yeah, I don't think they go to anything higher than 800 with, with anything where people are involved that haven't done this for a long time.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   I want to say, by the way, something that I don't know if I've ever said that in an interview, but you know, we wanted to get into some things that we never talked about.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   And, and that's, that's so interesting. It speaks also to this whole concept of consciousness. So, you know, we all know that these, you know, these shots, right, that, that people had to put in their bodies, right, that they contain certain stuff that's quite dangerous.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   Right. Even, you know, you're talking about graphene oxide and things like that. Right. And hydrogel is actually one of those things that has been found a lot in those.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   And, and by the way, also by the base institute. Right. So they, they have been able to verify all of that.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   And now what they did in this one study with the quantum upgrade. That was a lot of analysis study.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   They found, and they, they proved basically that as long as you are in a high consciousness field of the quantum upgrade, none of this stuff assembles in a way that it can basically harm you.
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   And it's, it just starts to assemble at that point where it's out of the body and, and you're not in that field anymore.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:58.000]   So basically, that means that with, with high consciousness, they can put into your body what they want, but, and maybe there's also limits to that, but the stuff they've been putting in it.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   They can affect you because the, the overarching consciousness is overriding that. So that I think is an amazing, amazing story in general and, and, and I want to say again, right.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   So of course, quantum upgrade and the blocks and all of that. These are amazing tools in these times right now where we need bridges where we need help, right, because we can't yet do it on our own.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   Ultimately, we can, and, and we can learn this and over the next years and decades, we will, as humanity, build that out way more.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   And, and it's important that we do because the consciousness, right, is that is, that is what we want to focus on to, to unlock more of that because it'll let us live better.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   Thank you and really appreciate that. I, did you have any final comments?
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   Amen, brother, but I think beautifully said, Philip, beautifully said.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   That is, you know, it's just like that old, that old philosophical saying, you know, is I think therefore I am, I think is the underlying motto of our consciousness.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   So, hey, guys, I was just wondering, you know, I, and I know you're, you're at your one hour mark or passed it on. I'm sorry. But do you have time for one last question or we just skipped this, because I wanted to introduce this as one more new thing that you guys haven't talked about just before we leave.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   Yeah, I mean, I'm good for another question. Okay, great. So, Philip, can you, okay, so now if people haven't noticed, you know, the reports have now, or the studies have been ported over to a third party website.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   And it's called the International Association for the Quantum Technology and Frequency Medicine, and it's a nonprofit. And so you haven't made any announcements as to this nonprofit.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   So I just was wondering if you'd like to just kind of introduce that to everybody for the first time to explain, you know, what this is all about. And where did it come from?
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   Yeah, well, it's actually a good point. I totally forgot that we never really talked much about it, but it came out of, out of two ways. So there's a, it's a nonprofit that sits in Austria.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   And it is focused on research in general, all around quantum technology and frequency medicine. And it doesn't even stop here, right, because there's, there could be stuff from Sherry Edwards, or even from a lot of other people.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   And then we got to write frequencies that end up, you know, on that nonprofit page because it, it kind of owes this type of research. And the, I think the idea there is that research can be also peer reviewed, which is currently not, I don't think it's set up yet for that.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   But it, it will be. That is the goal because a lot of this stuff is, it's just so far away from mainstream that mainstream doesn't take it on for, you know.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   Well, whatever reason, mainstream doesn't really want to acknowledge and talk about frequencies a lot. And then, yeah, naturally, there's then other platforms that pop up that offer that possibility.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   So that is just one thing. And then also there is regulation in the US, for example, where the FDA says, okay.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   You know, as a, if you have any types of products, you can't have research on your own page. You can talk about the research, but the actual studies need to be like two clicks away from a shop.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   That's just like one thing and everyone advises, you know, it's good if it's, if the actual research papers are accessible, but not on the same website. It's just a thing, you know, if we were a big pharmaceutical company, it most likely
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   would be different. We could say everything we want. And we could probably put all the research on our page. And now it's rather offloaded elsewhere. But, but I think it's, it's a neat way, actually, still. And, you know, yeah.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   No, that's great. It sounds like this is actually quite an amazing announcement that you've created a platform for all of this news, but I'll just call it the new science of quantum and frequency and have its own platform that is going to be out there and accessible by not just
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   Layla, but just anyone that's in this space. And everyone starts to come together and share their research. And to me, that's a pretty significant thing you just did. And no one's in no one's mentioned it. I just wanted to mention it to everybody that now, you know, if you
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   want to look at the studies, they're on this third party website. And I know this, I've only got a few dozen or so, or are you going to eventually put like all of them, like all 60 plus papers out there are going to eventually somebody actually should be there.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   If that's, if that's not the case, then I would need to talk to my team that was managing that but I'm pretty certain that all of it should be there. And I hope that at some point this year, the, maybe at the latest in Q1, a peer review process can start.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   Oh, that's fantastic. Which I think this would be extremely exciting because even it would be the new way of doing peer review, because it would even really be available and it would be accessible, it would be public.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   And yeah, so why not doing it this way? And I'm also looking forward to hosting that there's other research as well that's going to be there because frankly there's a lot in frequency medicine that's happening and we don't cover all and we don't want to cover all and it's great if there's others out there that also do great things.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   No, that's that's fantastic. I mean, you're right. I mean, at the end of the day, this is an all new science basically and now you've got your own platform. I think it's just incredible.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   Good job there. All right, so the guys I know you got to run. I want to just say thank you so much for spending a little time with me.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   If you infinity block and beyond captain commander, thank you so much for your time. If anyone wants to reach out and have questions for you, where can they find you.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   I love I like, let's go to the next conference like that.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   If you if you make that. Yeah, this is the field of dreams moment if you build it, I will wear it.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   This is amazing. Yeah, people can, you know, I mean, I and you can speak yourself but obviously wizard sciences and you find me on telegram and you can reach out to me there if you want.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   And everything else I think you you have links people know probably need a calm or quantum upgrade.io.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   Yeah, I'll be busily making that hat so I won't be able to answer any questions for the next next little while. Yeah, you know, I was, I was running, you know, I had to create these AI models of both of you and it was really hard to do you iron because you only got four
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   answers on the entire internet of you. And so I had to go scrub videos and then for whatever reason, you know, the AI came out with, you know, Philip being a NASA astronaut but you came out some kind of weird flash Gordon.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   I think that's somewhat appropriate fair enough. And it made sense that, you know, I was like, Oh, okay, I guess is the this is the intelligent design of the universe telling us something duck Dodgers the 24th and a half century.
