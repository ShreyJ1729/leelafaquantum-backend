[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Carbon Sixty video by me, Kay Omer, and in this video
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.000]   I would like to share with you my research into making and taking C60 MCT oil.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.800]   First, disclaimers, this material is for research purposes only, C60 oil is not approved for
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.440]   consumption by the FDA.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.960]   You understand that making and consuming C60 oil is experimental, and you do so at your
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.960]   own risk.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.480]   I do not endorse any products, I do not get paid in any way for making videos.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.640]   This material is purely my own research that I willingly share with others.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.680]   Alright, let's get started.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.160]   First of all, why even bother, right?
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.440]   You all know what C60 is and what the benefits of that is, hopefully by now.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.280]   But what are the benefits of MCT oil?
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.200]   Well, the first benefit is it's very antimicrobial in terms of being able to fight off bacteria
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.160]   and viruses that help balance your gut flora and support your immune health.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.200]   It provides clean, quick energy, especially to your brain when you take it and you will
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.400]   find that out if you try it.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.760]   It's easier to digest than most other fats, so if you have problems with, let's say, some
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.240]   of the more exotic oils, this might be easier on you, and they can help you lose unwanted
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.120]   fat because of the energy boost and its ability to suppress hunger.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.560]   And lastly, there's some discussions out there that it may actually improve insulin
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.720]   sensitivity.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.280]   So there's a lot of benefits to MCT as opposed to, let's say, just taking coconut oil by
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280]   itself.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.560]   But here's a little bit of a chemistry lesson, keep it short here for you, but what is MCT
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.560]   oil?
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.360]   Well, MCT stands for medium chain triglycerides, which are fatty acids that have an aliphatic
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.560]   tail of 6 to 12 carbon atoms.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.000]   And what that means is, and by illustration, is here's a diagram of the most common fatty
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.040]   acid found in coconut oil called lauric acid.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.960]   It's comprised of two parts.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.200]   The main part here, which is like the root of the molecule, is called the carboxyl group.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.520]   And then there's a chain of carbon atoms called the hydrocarbon chain attached to that that
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.480]   comprise the entire molecule.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.320]   Now it's those number of little Cs here, those carbon atoms.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.360]   It's the number of them that determine whether or not, which is, it's a small, medium or
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.360]   long chain triglyceride.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.560]   And so if it has 6 to 12 of these carbon atoms, it's going to be a medium chain triglyceride.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.600]   Now, MCT oil is most often derived from coconut oil, but it's sometimes made from palm oil.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.960]   And another really great benefit of MCT oil is that it's colorless, odorless and solidifies
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.480]   at 60.8 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.280]   And that's important because coconut oil solidifies at 76.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.720]   So if you live in a colder climate and you don't want to your oil to harden on your countertop,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.760]   then switching from coconut to MCT will prevent that.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.800]   And also if you don't like the taste of coconut oil, MCT is the way to go.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.200]   Now when you're talking about coconut oil in general, there's 13 different fatty acids
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.580]   that comprise coconut oil.
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.640]   And these are all the different fatty acids.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.360]   But it's only these five right here that have 6 to 12 carbon atoms in the molecule and are
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.400]   considered to be the medium chain fatty acids.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.640]   So what's interesting though when I was doing my research on this was that although there
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.680]   are five different MCT oils as shown in the prior slide in coconut oil, the products sold
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.680]   as MCT oil are made up of primarily three of them, caprylic acid, which is eight carbon
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.160]   atoms, capric acid, which is 10 carbon atoms, and then lauric acid, the 12, all right?
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.840]   So that was what I thought was very interesting.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.960]   The other two are ignored.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.720]   I would say that there's probably trace elements of them, but they're not disclosed on the
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.720]   product labels.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.200]   And that's where I got my data from.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.240]   So now let's take a look at these three and to figure out why are these the three that
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.920]   are sold as MCT oil in products.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.800]   The first one, and this is like the gold standard of MCT of all the different MCTs.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.240]   This is the one that has the best benefits when you're taking it.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.200]   And it has a high potent antimicrobial properties that help you maintain healthy gut and of
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.840]   course again, fastest to metabolize in the brain.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.360]   And I want to repeat that.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:23.440]   The caprylic acid, C8, of all the medium chain triglycerides is the fastest fatty acid that
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.280]   will to metabolize in your brain.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.520]   Your liver does not need to process this rare type of MCT, and it only takes three steps
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.440]   for your body to turn it into ATP, which is the cellular fuel you use.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:44.480]   Now sugar as a comparison takes 26 steps to convert from sugar into ATP, which makes what
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.160]   C8 or caprylic acid so good at suppressing your cravings.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.600]   Now as an example, if you wanted to try to take caprylic acid, but you only took coconut,
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.780]   it would take 18 tablespoons of coconut oil to just get one tablespoon of caprylic acid.
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.160]   So it is very, very small part of coconut oil, but when you extract it, it has amazing
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.160]   benefits.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:17.040]   So the next fatty acid in coconut oil that is used in products is the capric acid, which
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.240]   is C10, and it's represented 48% of coconut oil.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.320]   Now it has caprylic, I'm sorry, it has similar benefits as caprylic acid, but it's not as
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   effective.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.960]   It has a slower to turn into energy.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.120]   It's also more affordable.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.200]   It's apparently easier to produce than C8 or extract, I would say.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.840]   And then it is, but it is the only other MCT, and this is a key point again.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.080]   It's the only other MCT that turns into ATP quickly without going through the liver.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.080]   Okay.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.120]   And then you would need, if you want to compare, six tablespoons of coconut oil to get one
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.560]   tablespoon of C10 oil.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:59.920]   So capric acid is like the little brother to caprylic acid in terms of the highly beneficial
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:07.120]   MCT or fatty acids extracted from coconut oil that's sold on products in products.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.320]   So the last one, the other third one I would say, is laric acid, which is comprised of
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.680]   the 12 carbon atoms in the molecule, and like I said earlier, it comprises practically
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.320]   half of coconut oil.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.400]   Now the thing about laric acid though is that it requires a pit stop in the liver rather
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.600]   than getting immediately converted into energy like other MCTs.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   So that's why there's a huge difference in energy boost when you just take plain old
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.960]   coconut oil versus caprylic acid coconut oil or a combination of caprylic and capric.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:41.920]   Now this is why, you know, laric acid is more accurately described as an LCT because of
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.160]   the way it acts in the body.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.320]   And not so much like MCT as marketers claim.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.960]   That's kind of a debate out there in this product chain.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.680]   And the product area for MCTs is that, you know, is laric acid really MCT.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.800]   Now the thing about laric acid too is it raises cholesterol more than any other fatty acid.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.960]   And it's also commonly cited as having antimicrobial effects, which it does, except the shorter
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:14.080]   chain MCTs which are way more effective against aggressive Candida yeast and even gonorrhea
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.600]   and chlamydia as a monoglyce, glyceride, glyceride, I guess I said that right.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.360]   So those are the three.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.920]   And so when I took a look at the different ratios of fatty acids in various products,
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.720]   I went on Amazon, did that yesterday.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.780]   And I looked at only 32 ounce bottles so you get a price comparison apples to apples and
[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.360]   all of these various numbers here expressed in grams.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.560]   By the way, there's a copy of this in the video description below.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.560]   There's a link to it.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.280]   So if you want to just go ahead and pull that up, you can click on any one of these.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.800]   It'll take you right to the Amazon page.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.920]   But this is what I kind of discovered by comparing a bunch of them.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.000]   And I just went down the full page, right, just at random, so there's no bias here.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.680]   And so here's all the different ones that were posted on the page when I did a search
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.800]   on MCT oil, 32 ounces.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:10.880]   And then what I found was there's a wide range of what I would call the blend, the ratios
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.800]   of the different kinds of acids.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.860]   And so as I stated, caprylic acid is the most expensive to extract and the next is
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.860]   capric.
[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.920]   And then of course, lauric is basically coconut oil, half a coconut oil.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.920]   You can see that there's this huge range.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.960]   And literally there's 13 that the first 13 I ran across.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   There's only two.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:37.480]   These two guys right here that have the same blend.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.240]   They have 9.8 grams of caprylic and 4.2 capric.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.240]   And so everybody, other than that, every single other one of these is different.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.640]   And I think that's really important to note that if the best MCT is caprylic, you can
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:56.560]   see by this and I arranged it by the amount of caprylic acid, then you're going to want
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.720]   obviously more caprylic acid.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.240]   And then the thing also too, I noticed in the marketing literature was that everyone
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.760]   really touts how much caprylic acid they've got.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.240]   And if they don't have a lot, then they just tout MCT.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.080]   But this is the best one for your body, capric is next.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:19.320]   So you can see where everyone basically has way more caprylic than capric and some most
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.000]   don't have any loric at all, it's just these two.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.760]   And so when you're looking at shopping and buying MCT oils, keep that in mind, keep the
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.800]   blend in mind.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:33.440]   And then if you just want it only caprylic acid, then these are the only two.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.760]   And one of them is called bullet proof octane, well actually I would say three because this
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.500]   is such a small difference right here.
[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.920]   So let's say there's three that are primarily just pure caprylic acid.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:50.760]   So you've got bullet proof, brain octane, you've got transfer terra formulations, and life
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.760]   sense keto.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:57.600]   Now this is the one I started out buying bullet proof octane, I bought a couple of bottles
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.000]   of those, but I switched over to terra formulations because look at the price difference here.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.480]   You look at bullet proof, it sells for $45.95 as of yesterday.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.520]   I think my first time I ever bought it was like $52.55.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:17.240]   And so I thought that was what it costs, but man, you can get as low as $30 and get literally
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.920]   more caprylic acid in the bottle than you do from bullet proof.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.800]   And that's literally a 34% savings off of bullet proof.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:31.000]   So I switched to this one from a cost savings because it's way cheaper to buy this brand
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.080]   than it is to buy bullet proof.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.320]   Of course then if you want to get the most caprylic acid, it's $36.95.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:43.360]   So these three right here are the ones to go if you just want to get the quote, brain
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.200]   octane level, caprylic 100% caprylic acid.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.920]   And then the rest are just a different blend of the different acids as stated.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.240]   So that's an interesting little data point that I had.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:03.320]   Now in terms of making C60 oil, as I mentioned, I just go with 100% caprylic acid after reading
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.800]   all the stuff that I read.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:11.160]   So that's what I use when I say MCTO from this point forward, which is important to remember
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.160]   now.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.840]   Everybody calls MCT oil, but you got to go, well, what's in it when you buy it?
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.600]   So I buy the 100% caprylic acid MCT oil, okay?
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.040]   That's the standard I've set for myself.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.560]   And so now how to make it, and these are the simple steps, and the thing about it too,
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.560]   the very first thing you should realize is that, and this has been confirmed by practically
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:41.480]   everybody I've chatted with in the telegram group, in that when they make C60 MCT oil,
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:48.120]   when they add the C60 to it, usually everyone's using powder, the C60 just falls.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:55.960]   It's so less viscous, it's watery compared to coconut oil, that it's literally acts
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   like water.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:04.880]   But because it's not thick, it just doesn't hold the C60 in clodal suspension like coconut
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.520]   oil would, or avocado, or olive oil.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:15.360]   And so what happens is, and this is after like, geez, I would say half a dozen or so
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:22.600]   batches that I've done, is that I've found that when I add the regular amount of C60,
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.080]   which is eight grams per thousand milliliters into the first batch I make, I just do the
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.640]   same standard process, which is the rat study benchmark, back to basics there.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.600]   Stir for two weeks, and I let it settle for 10.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.080]   And so that's my first batch, and you get a hundred, it's basically a thousand milliliters.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:47.760]   And then because C60 falls out of MCT, and you don't get as much that stays in solution,
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.040]   I just, what I do, and you'll notice this, and I'll show you the video, you'll notice
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:57.440]   that there's quite a bit of C60 at the bottom of the flask after you let it settle.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.840]   And so what I do is I just filter off the top, you know, 975 milliliters, I leave about
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:09.240]   25 milliliters at the very bottom of the flask, and I try not to disturb it, because I don't
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.240]   want to put it in them.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.240]   I don't want to filter it out.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.240]   It's very expensive.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:17.360]   I mean, you guys realize, right, C60 right now is retailing at five and a half times the
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.440]   value of gold.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.000]   So it is very expensive, do not waste it.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.480]   And so what I do is I gently pour the top off into my filter, and I filter it.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:34.680]   And then when the empty flass has got the C60 in the bottom, I'll add more oil, repeat
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.880]   steps two and three, which is, let's stir it again, settle it again, pour off the top
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:44.360]   again, add more oil, stir it, settle it, and then filter it one last time.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.360]   And what I've successfully been able to do, and I've done this twice now.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.520]   And I'm actually doing it the third time right now, which is make three separate batches
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.800]   out of one attempt.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.160]   And so the process goes like this from a visual standpoint.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.720]   My first batch is 1,000 milliliters, I pour off the top filter.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.800]   My second batch is 500 milliliters, then I pour off the top and filter, and then my
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.720]   third batch is 250 milliliters, and then I just filter the whole thing.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:22.040]   And by the time you're down to the third batch, you can still see this black film on the
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.920]   bottom of the flask, but there's so little left, it's not worth trying to go for a fourth
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.920]   one.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.920]   And that's my experience.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:35.440]   And then when you do it this way, you're totally yelled out of one, I would say one
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.480]   little dose of C60 in the oil.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:48.160]   It comes out that you end up with 1,700 milliliters of C60 MCT oil, if you go with the standard
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.320]   rat study approach.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.720]   And then the estimate, and this is something that I'm guessing, some of the other folks
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:02.040]   on the chat room are guessing, is that the estimated saturation of C60 and MCT because
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:08.000]   of this effect, where it doesn't hold well, is about 0.4 milligrams per milliliters.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   And that's our guess right now, because it's almost impossible to measure.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.640]   And so let me show you how that looks when I did it at home.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:22.280]   So now one of the things that obviously is stir it first, so you can see while it's so
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.440]   watery, it creates this little vortex here, and you don't really see that at all in coconut
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.440]   oil or other oils.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.560]   And so this is, you can see where I've added the C60, the powder's filtering in, it's
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.560]   stirring around it.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.000]   It immediately starts to turn black, and then it just stirs and stirs, and this is batch
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.920]   one at 1,000 milliliters.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.360]   And this is what it looks like when you first add the C60 to it, it turns black, and then
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:51.520]   about 24 hours later, it'll convert into just this beautiful dark purple color, okay?
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.720]   All right.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:59.680]   And so once it's been sitting there, then again, this is where you would stir it for
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.000]   two weeks, and this is after letting it settle for 10 days.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.600]   This is where I was filtering it, and if you recognize the video, this is in my vacuum
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:15.760]   bump video times, and so that's what it looks like when I'm filtering the very first batch,
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.520]   and I just let me back this up a second.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.680]   See this right here?
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.800]   This right here is what's left over after the first batch, and so you can just see how
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:28.320]   much C60 has just fallen out, and this is after stirring two weeks, and letting it settle
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.400]   for 10 days.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.960]   It just all falls right out.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.600]   But this is what you get that's, you know, basically this is your first batch, and it
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.720]   comes out this beautiful purple color.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:41.960]   And so filter out the first batch, take care of that puppy, and then with this guy, add
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.200]   back in the oil till you get around 500, that's kind of me holding it weird.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:52.800]   And so then you pour the oil, you fresh oil, fresh MCT oil, by the way, into the flask,
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.800]   stir vigorously.
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.400]   You got to really, really, really whip it around there to get it all off the bottom,
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.640]   and then you put it back on your stir for a couple of weeks here.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.280]   And so that's what's important.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.240]   Make sure though that this is an important step.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.360]   You've got to pull it off the bottom by just shaking the crap out of it, basically, so
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.920]   that there's nothing left on the bottom.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.320]   It's all in suspension before you put it on your stir, okay?
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:21.760]   And then this is what it ends up looking like the first batch when it was done.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.960]   One thing here I want to add to just on a side note, this is the filter after the first
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.320]   batch, and you can see that it's not black, which means that you got pretty much all
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.480]   of the C60 has floated to the bottom, and then what's left that's suspended usually
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.560]   is always brown for me, and I'm not sure exactly what that brown is.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.160]   It's whatever particulates were in the oil or whatever, but this is what the filter looks
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.440]   like after you finish with the first batch.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.000]   And I get a question I just want to put out here real quick, is that in the chat room,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.160]   I get a question quite often about whether or not people need to filter or not.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:02.120]   And so the answer is quite simply this, if this brown stuff, if you don't mind letting
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:06.520]   your kidneys filter this for you, and you don't have problems with your kidneys filtering
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.600]   it for you, then by all means you don't need to filter.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.120]   But for someone like myself, I've had kidney stones a few times.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:20.320]   I don't want this in my body, and I did have problems with it last year, so I make sure
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:27.280]   they use a filter, so I don't want my kidneys to be the filter for my C60 oil.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.480]   And so I use a filter paper, otherwise if you don't have problems, go ahead.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.960]   But that brown stuff is what's going to go into your body and get filtered by your kidneys
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.200]   if you don't filter.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.880]   Anyway, so this is batch number two.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.960]   It's black again, right, and I just put it on the stirrer, and here we go again.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:52.440]   This is batch number two, stir two weeks, let's settle for ten days, and then we're
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:59.920]   going to go ahead and make batch number three as we filter batch number two.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.680]   So let's see, we've got that vortex again.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.880]   So now I just let that sit, and then once it's done sitting, this is the color it turns
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.520]   and you can see something that's interesting at this point.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.320]   It's not that beautiful purple anymore.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:16.280]   The second one comes out this dusty, something dusty rose sort of color.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.760]   I'm not sure, but that's the color of the second batch.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:25.640]   And then once I pour that in, you'll see the amount of C60 at the very bottom of again
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:33.300]   be very, very, very, very, very gentle when pouring out the C60 oil or MCT oil.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.880]   You don't want to disturb the C60 at the bottom.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.840]   Now that's it right there.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.840]   You see that?
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.160]   This is what's left after this.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.120]   This is literally, that is the second batch right there, the bottom of the second batch.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.300]   So what I'm going to do is take this and I'm going to make a third batch with it, but
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.000]   you can see how much less dark it is.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.280]   It's definitely a lot less C60 in the flask, but there's C60 in there you can tell, right?
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.360]   You can see right there.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.880]   So set that aside, finish up batch number two, filter this guy off.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.280]   Here's my MCT that I bought, terra formulations, and then I'm going to pour this for my third
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.280]   batch now.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.840]   I'm going to fill it back up to 250 milliliters or thereabouts.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.040]   It's kind of hard to do that when I'm holding the camera, so I was guessing there.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.160]   And so I realize right now it should have been up to here.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.760]   Anyway, so again, this is batch number three.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:29.000]   Shake the crap out of it, get the C60 off the bottom, get it into suspension.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.560]   It looks like it needs more shaking right there, okay?
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.400]   That's the main thing though, make sure that nothing is stuck to the bottom because it'll
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.960]   stick to the bottom if you don't give it a good shake.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:44.000]   Okay, and there you go, there's that 250 roughly or whatever, I think I blew that one.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.560]   That would probably be the 200 line.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.520]   So 200 milliliters and there it is and there it just, well, that's a little aggressive.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.440]   I think it turned it down after that.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.000]   And then that's batch number three.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.200]   So this is batch number three now, the 250.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.480]   And it's got, make sure all your 660's in suspension.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.480]   And then there you go.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.120]   Now this is batch number two, I've finished, well, you know, I'm doing two things at once.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.440]   So this is batch number two, filtering away and this is the color it turns out to.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.560]   And so what's really cool is there you go.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:17.000]   That's batch number two, a lot, not a lot, a little lighter than the batch number one.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   And then of course your batch number three is going to be lighter in color than batch
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.160]   number two.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:26.200]   So that's kind of, I kind of tried to display that with these three colors.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.400]   But that's the general idea that you're going to have to go, you know, batch number one,
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.600]   batch number two, batch number three, well, at least you don't have to, but that's how
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.600]   I do it.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.600]   That's what works for me.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.920]   I've done, this is my third time of doing three batches.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.120]   And each time I've had the same results, it comes out really well and you end up having
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.320]   a very nice purple MCT, you know, C60 oil.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.960]   So there you go.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.200]   It's pretty simple.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.320]   Just follow these simple steps and you can go ahead and duplicate that effort.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.920]   I've confirmed it now, you know, with doing so often.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.920]   So that's how I do it.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:04.840]   So the thing about the saturation point, so this is a purple power, if you're familiar
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:11.260]   with the product, the C60 purple power, they're the ones that kind of made it the term famous,
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:16.560]   at least in the C60 environment, is what inside the telegram chat group that we have,
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:23.520]   the C60 group, somebody actually sent an email to the purple power guys and asked them,
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:31.920]   you know, how do you get 0.9, you know, because they claim they have 0.9 milligrams per milliliter.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:37.040]   And as you can see, because of the MCT oil doesn't hold the C60 and it keeps falling out
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   and falling out, you take 0.8 grams and you put it in and then it just, you know, they're
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.360]   still left over and they're still left over, that, you know, we, the people in the chat
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.840]   group, have somewhat estimated that it's 0.4, but you've got purple power and they're
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.400]   claiming that they have 0.9.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.400]   So somebody out there asked them and then this was their reply and I wanted to share
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:01.080]   it with you because it's really kind of interesting from a, from a how much C60 can you get in
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.760]   MCT oil, right?
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.320]   And so this is their response.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:08.720]   Our production, and purple power, sorry, our production people have developed new mixing
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:14.480]   techniques which can get well over 2 milligrams of C60 per milliliter.
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.760]   Now that's 2 milligrams compared to 0.8, which is the rad study, right?
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:23.640]   But that's per milliliter in avocado oil, okay, that's what they're saying.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:30.640]   So it is not a problem for us to get 0.9 milligrams of C60 per milliliter into coconut oil.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.880]   Okay, so this, no, this is the discussions MCT.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:43.520]   So they say you are correct that MCT does not hold as much C60 as the longer 18 carbon
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.960]   chain avocado oil.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:53.640]   We have not been able to get over 2 milligrams of C60 per milliliter for the MCT, okay?
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:24:00.140]   So they're admitting that, that MCT doesn't hold as well as coconut or avocado, and they're
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.400]   saying that they haven't been able to achieve it over two, you know, worse, you're stuck
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   at 0.4.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:11.440]   So that's still, you know, it's interesting to, you know, that they've got 0.9, we're
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:17.320]   getting 0.4, and they can't even get over 0.9 for themselves, obviously, with MCT for,
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:22.960]   you know, for the MCT with this new technique, but can, using regular coconut oil, which
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:29.280]   is what they stated through our product, though our product is only sold using MCT oil at
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.280]   this point.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:36.360]   So they're saying that they're only using MCT oil, they can get over 2 milligrams of
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:41.760]   coconut, but they can't in MCT, and they're saying that their MCT is 0.9.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.640]   So that, you know, so that's real interesting.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:52.160]   So Purple Power is able, per their claim to get 0.9 milligrams per milliliters of C60
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.840]   in MCT oil, but the rest of us get like less than that.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.880]   So, so I just wanted to throw this out there.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.640]   How do you increase the C60 saturation MCT oil?
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.640]   So what are your thoughts?
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.880]   Well, these are what, you know, some of the discussion in the chat groups of my own thoughts,
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.840]   but, you know, clearly it's kind of like the challenges on how do we do this?
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.240]   Because they, quote, have figured it out, but, you know, we have it.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.440]   But the thing is, is I'm using 100% caprylic acid.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:24.240]   So the very first thought I had was what's their ratio, which they do not disclose.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:30.480]   So, and whether or not they use long chain triglycerides, and is that part of their MCT?
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.480]   If you remember from up here, everybody's different, you know, in terms of how much
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:39.920]   caprylic versus caprylic versus laric acid is what they're calling MCT.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:46.560]   So when Purple Power says we've got MCT, what we don't know is what's their fatty acid ratios,
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:51.400]   what's their blend, you know, of the different acids that comprise what they're calling MCT
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.760]   in order to get 0.9.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:58.480]   So that's something that is a thought that, you know, to experiment with different blends
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:06.000]   and to see if you can get a higher saturation of C60 to increase the amount of C60 that MCT
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   will hold.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:14.240]   And also, too, the type of C60, whether it's a sublime, regular, you know, powder, sublime
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.880]   powder or pulverized, you know, it comes in different forms.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:23.600]   So, you know, that could be a factor, obviously, temperature, we know from the one study on
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:29.160]   olive oil that the colder the oil was, the higher of saturation rate it would have in
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.700]   terms of holding the C60 and colloidal suspension.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:38.640]   So maybe, you know, maybe temperature is an issue you can get as noted earlier, you can
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:44.400]   get as low as 61 degrees or I would go 62, you know, with MCT without it getting hard.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.000]   So, you know, lowering the temperature may be a way because it works with olive oil.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.920]   The duration of stirring, one of the individuals on the chat group actually documented his
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:04.120]   MCT effort and it's linked in the description below and did a fantastic job in his experiment
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:09.680]   and his making of MCT C60 oil and he documented it really well, I highly recommend you guys
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.680]   check it out.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:15.120]   He's got his pictures and everything and he's also an individual that thinks it's .4 milligrams
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.680]   per milliliters of saturation.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.080]   And so right now I believe he's experimenting with going three weeks of stirring instead
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.280]   of two and so that's another idea too.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:29.360]   So, you know, these are all different ideas because I know all of you are tinkerers like
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.360]   myself, we're going to probably start trying to figure out how do I get, you know, because
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:38.960]   MCT is such a superior oil, you know, it'd be great if we could get up to .9 or 2 milligrams
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.000]   and get that, you know, C60 held in solution in an MCT oil.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.580]   But for right now, you know, I don't know what else, I'm trying to think of other things
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.040]   that might make that happen.
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:58.600]   So, so, ROG is looking at doing a three week stir, I'm thinking of blending different ones
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:04.080]   and lowering the temperature, maybe trying pulverized instead of powder, you know, that
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.080]   kind of thing.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.040]   The stirring method is also something to consider.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:14.160]   One of the things about stirring is they do make magnetic stirs, right, that go that
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.720]   reverse direction.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:20.380]   And if you know, if you remember your physics class, right, when you do that, it creates
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.000]   this huge energy flux.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   When you're stirring one way, then stir it the opposite way.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.920]   And so they switch back and forth or you can actually stir just counterclockwise or you
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:34.320]   can stir just clockwise, you know, and then structuring is the whole concept of if you
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.400]   understand what water structuring is all about, you can apply some of those same methodologies
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.000]   as well while it's being stirred.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.500]   So these are some of the ideas right off the top of my head.
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.840]   And lastly, you know, if you've got any ideas on ways you think that you can increase saturation
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:53.560]   of C60 than by all means, because that's just something we're all chewing on right now,
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.200]   because we keep running into this really low saturation rate.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.560]   And then lastly, I want to leave you with this idea is that the MCT dosage, and this
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.360]   is something to just remember that if you make it at home, you're gotten home grade, if you're
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:10.840]   buying purple power, that's commercial grade, and pretty much twice as much C60s in it.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:15.360]   But if you take a look at the rat study, which is the benchmark of all, the saturation rate
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:21.440]   is this that 0.8 milligrams per milli, that's how much C60 is in the oil.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.880]   And one tablespoon is around 15 milliliters.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:31.660]   So when you take an olive oil, C60 in olive oil, you take one tablespoon, you are pretty
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.960]   much taking 12 milligrams of C60.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.600]   So you know, everyone always talks about the oil, but what's really important here is how
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.920]   much C60 are you trying to take.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.760]   And so if you're taking regular olive oil or avocado oil, and it's 0.8 milligrams per
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.320]   milliliters, then you're getting about 12 milligrams per tablespoon.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.160]   Now when you make this home grade, and it's only 0.4, it's half of that.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:01.800]   So one tablespoon of home grade MCT oil is only going to be 6 milligrams of C60 in terms
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   of a dose.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:10.240]   And so you literally, if you're going to take C60 MCT oil as your primary source of C60,
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:16.360]   then keep in mind that you want to get the same normal dose that you would get in avocado
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.880]   or oil, you need to take twice as much MCT oil, okay?
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.920]   So keep that in mind.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:27.920]   And the last thing that I want to point out, and this has been reported to me by Jay, my
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:33.880]   buddy from the topical video, and it also happened to me, is that caprylic acid for
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:39.400]   whatever reason, I mean, when I take that and when he took it on an empty stomach, you
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:45.760]   know, and we take like a, you know, like the tablespoon or two at a time, it really just,
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.760]   it hurts.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:49.680]   I mean, it just causes stomach upset, like it's bad.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:55.800]   But so what I do is I put it in my morning smoothie and he's taking it with food and
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.080]   then you don't feel the stomach pain.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:06.920]   So I don't recommend taking 100% C60 caprylic acid MCT oil without, on an empty stomach,
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:07.920]   okay?
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.280]   So take it with food and remember to take twice as much.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:14.760]   Now what I do is, like I said, I put it in my morning smoothie.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:22.240]   I take a tablespoon of C60 MCT oil, I eat 100% caprylic acid MCT oil.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:29.040]   I take one tablespoon of that and one tablespoon of C60 avocado oil to get, to get what I consider
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.360]   to be my daily dose, which as you can see from the math here, that's about 18 milligrams
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.840]   of C60 per day.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:35.840]   All right.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.240]   So that's, that's my research again.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   You know, thank you.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.880]   Thank you for, for listening to this.
