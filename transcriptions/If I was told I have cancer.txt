[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I am your host, Kay Elmer, and in
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:13.440]   this video, I'd like to share with you what my thoughts are if I was told I have cancer because,
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.840]   you know, some of you who've been following my videos for a while now know that I'm a tinker and
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.400]   tinker in the space of health and healing. I've been doing that for a couple of decades. I moderate
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.480]   several telegram channels and, you know, chat groups. And so I see this post come up quite often
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.400]   and over the years. And so what I wanted to do was kind of just share some information that I have
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:44.640]   a collected because I've been researching this for quite a long time now, so that, you know,
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.600]   just to get this information out into the world. But before I get into that, I kind of wanted to
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.800]   just bring you up to speed to a new development. If you didn't catch this in the news, this came
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.800]   out four weeks ago today is September 21st, 2023. And I just wanted to share this with you so that
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.200]   you're aware of what's going on, especially as it relates to YouTube videos. YouTube staff has new
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.640]   marching orders to crack down on medical misinformation. The social media platform has roughly two and
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.240]   a half billion monthly users and now says it will remove videos that promote, among other things,
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.800]   potentially harmful treatments for cancer. CTVs Vanessa Lee explains.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:32.320]   YouTube is cracking down on videos containing false claims about cancer treatments. In a blog,
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.920]   it's Global Head of Health Care says this includes content that promotes unproven treatments in
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.480]   place of approved care or as a guaranteed cure for it. All right. So just as it heads up,
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.440]   YouTube is going to pull any fake claims for cancer treatment and or
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:58.240]   anything they deem not to follow along in the standard American care. So, you know, be aware
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.360]   that if you do post a video like this, it will be removed and most likely your YouTube channel will
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.960]   blow up. So other than that, I just hope that all of you really pay attention to what you're
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.000]   supposed to know and follow along with the party line and do everything your doctor says.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.480]   Aloha.
