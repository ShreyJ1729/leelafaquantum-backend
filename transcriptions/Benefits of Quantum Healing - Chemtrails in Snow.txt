[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and in this video
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.520]   I'd like to address a question that was popped up in our telegram chat group on the quantum power channel
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.160]   And it was involving someone asking about you know
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.960]   Has there been any studies on chemtrails or I guess the question specifically was is do the blocks have any effect on chemtrails?
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.800]   So I just wanted to kind of highlight one of the studies that was done by the BESSA Institute
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.520]   Regarding just that question and so a couple of things here, you know the the Layla quantum tech
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.020]   Commissions a lot of different studies and a lot of their profits are rolled right back into
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.960]   Different studies by different institutes and different doctors and scientists and so forth to evaluate the you know
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.600]   The benefit of quantum energy and not all the studies get published on the website
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.120]   So this is one of those kind of like obscure studies that you know BESSA decided to do
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.800]   It's not on the website
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.560]   But you know here it is in front of you and you can go ahead and take a kind of let me kind of walk you through the details of it
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.960]   And then the idea here behind this one is BESSA has you know
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.520]   They have all the different products because they've been studying them so they decided in the middle of winter
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.520]   Hey, let's go. Let's go find out
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.600]   What the effect of quantum energy is on?
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.560]   Chemtrails because as you for those of you who know what those are
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.000]   You know it's stuff that sprayed in the air and it sinks down and then what better place to then kind of test it
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Other you know other than you know, let's go ahead and test the snow that's on the ground because obviously
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.800]   Common sense wise if you're spraying it in the atmosphere and it's in the middle of winter
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.240]   All of that stuff is going to settle on to the snow and that's exactly what BESSA did
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.240]   So with that said now I usually in every video I like to choose provide context of the study and so
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.720]   This one in particular. I actually did a 10-minute
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:03.800]   I guess you know a review of the BESSA Institute and their practices their materials and methods for conducting studies so who they are
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.400]   What bioenergetics analysis is it's also known as radian stress assessment the science behind that
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.600]   So that if you want to kind of get some idea about who they are what they do and what these results really really mean
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.160]   Then I want to refer you to and I'll put a link in the video description below of the most recent
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.720]   Study that I covered which was on the effects of quantum healing on electric vehicles emf in electric vehicles
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.440]   So if you just watch the first 10 minutes of that video
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.040]   It gives you all of the context for you to be able to understand
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.240]   The you know what the results are for for all of these different studies at BESSA has been doing
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.040]   So, you know, I just want to refer you to that
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040]   I don't really want to you know
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.760]   I don't think it's necessary to repeat the same 10 minutes in every video
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.560]   And I'm just going to jump right into the study. So this is it right here now
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.280]   This is by the BESSA Institute and what they did was they wanted to study again chemtrail chemtrails with an on new snow
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.760]   And then they use the quantum block and so I'm just going to expand this so you can read it
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.920]   Make it a little bit bigger and I'm just going to jump down into the materials and methods section
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.040]   This is the description of the different ranges. I covered that in the other video a bottom line for those of you
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.720]   You know, don't have time to take a look at that other video
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.760]   I'm just going to say
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.600]   This is how it really kind of simplifies it. Okay, so it's kind of a stoplight yellow means caution
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.360]   Blue means bad red means you hit somebody in the inner section
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.440]   Okay, bottom line it's yellow is caution blue is bad
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:44.520]   Red is your red you are it you've already had your accident now your car is damaged green is green green is good green is good
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.480]   So you only really want to see green, you know in terms of the results have been color-coded
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.840]   Okay, so remember that blue red blue bad red really really bad and green is good
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.120]   And so now what they did basically now
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.720]   We just jump right into the methods and materials
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.960]   Okay, the first thing that the BESSA would do in all of their studies is they actually do a baseline measurement
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.400]   So they take a person or persons right the different subjects of the study and then right when they show up at the Institute
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.480]   They'll go ahead and or they you know go out in the field. They'll do a meridian stress assessment
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.840]   Or what they call bioenergetic stress or bioenergetic analysis. That's their term for it
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.920]   I call it a meridian stress assessment. Same thing and so they do an assessment of the individual using their their decovole type device
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.840]   And then take a measurement of all of their different meridians that then indicate all the different
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.320]   Conditions of the various organs and so forth and they'll just go
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.480]   Okay, this is the before picture
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.000]   This is before we do anything with this this person and then the next thing they did right here and in particular to this study
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.880]   Was they brought that person into contact with fresh? No, okay?
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.200]   And so in contact is not clearly defined, but it's either in the room with them or they're holding it
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.320]   They're touching it, but it's near them. Okay, that's typically the methodology that BESSA employed
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.160]   They've done different studies where they're actually holding a vial of some kind of toxin
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.880]   Or they're like in the room with Wi-Fi on that sort of thing
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.160]   So the idea here is that the person is then exposed to the to the substance
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.560]   Whatever that substance might be and then that of course then they do an after and so the after want here now
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.240]   They basically was brought into contact with fresh snow
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.120]   And then the next thing they did was with the new snow
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:31.160]   Is activated in the quantum block so then they took the snow and they put it in the quantum block right and then they
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.680]   Exposed that person to the treated snow, you know treated by quantum blocks
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.880]   And so then we can take a look at what the bio energetic responses were of the subject
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.480]   For this particular study and so I'm just going to jump right to the results now the very first one here
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:54.040]   Is and you know again, you know, if you've seen the other studies that I've covered, you know, it measures the meridian
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.640]   Energetics of all of the various major organs of the body and so you can kind of see all the graphs here
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.960]   But really what we're looking at from a summary standpoint is what was that person?
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.800]   You know when when they first showed up in the field or when they first showed up at the institute and the clinicians measured them
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.240]   You know what what you know?
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.480]   How did they look energetically and in this case this individual before anything happened?
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:23.560]   Okay, it was basically 50 percent in the green meaning optimal health state and then 50 percent in the blue meaning that there was
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.120]   You know stress indicators on the person remember now yellow is just caution
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.000]   So there's not you know, but blue means that the body is under stress and it's it's actually
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.760]   Reacting and it's actually reacting to environmental stress
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.840]   Normally that environmental stress is all of the stuff around you
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.120]   You know, we live in a toxic soup if you truly dig into it and deep dive into
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:53.640]   The normal person's environment you are smothered in electro smog and every single thing you come into contact is toxic to you
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.360]   From everything from laundry soap to shampoo
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.480]   To the water the food everything is there's toxins and everything whether it's preservatives
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:08.040]   Food is just loaded with glauphosphates, which is you know carcinogenic. I mean, you know, everything right smart meters
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.880]   It's just all this stuff
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.280]   So typically every single animal and every single person every single plant on the on the planet
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.760]   Right now because of the environment we've created
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:22.840]   Is suffering from some kind of bio energetic stress on their systems that their body is constantly fighting against
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.080]   Okay to maintain health, but this individual here was 50 percent, you know
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.200]   Hey doing really good the other 50 percent. They were showing stresses
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:36.280]   And you can actually look at where the stresses are occurring, you know in this individual. There was you know definite issues with lungs
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.760]   Skin their stomach looked good the connective tissue looked good, you know, blah blah blah
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.960]   Nerve generation was blue and so you can actually see
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.840]   The different, you know, like where exactly is this person having stress within their bodies?
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:55.080]   Limp kidneys allergies, you know, they're all having this, you know, blue meaning that those areas of their body were under stress
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.000]   And that's your typical picture. It really is
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.880]   I've read
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.640]   Dozens of these studies and the typical picture of anybody off the street is
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.520]   You're doing good and have in mind, but you're still fighting off quite a bit of stress on your system
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.440]   And so that's really why I recommend everybody have a daily detox regimen, you know detoxing
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.840]   Is not something you do once every quarter
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.840]   It is something you should be doing every single day because of the environment we live in
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.760]   Plus you should do whatever you can to mitigate EMF. Okay, so that put that little speech to the side
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:32.600]   Now this is that individual again before they're exposed to the snow off the ground in and this is in austria
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.560]   But if for anybody who wants to just go outside look up at the sky on a blue sunny day in the mornings
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.000]   And you will see that those chemtrails are being sprayed over your head
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   So now and it lands on the snow. So this person is then exposed to snow and look what happens
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.440]   First of all, there's no green zero zero percent green
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:57.160]   Now all of a sudden the toxicity of the chemicals in the snow
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:05.240]   Is now causing their body 72 percent of their bioenergetics is now being subjected to stress
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.840]   Okay, and it's occurring in every one of their major organs
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.680]   You can see right here from the different listings
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:16.600]   Everything from their heart their small intestine you name it that they're measuring stress when they measure their meridians
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.160]   And they're just they're discovering that. Hey, this is definitely having a toxic effect on this person
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:27.480]   Their body is reacting to it and 72 percent of their bioenergetic energy is going towards fighting off that stress
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:33.000]   But what's even more concerning is this red red means damage is actually occurring
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.520]   To your body 27 percent all of a sudden now they're exposed to chemtrails in snow
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.680]   And 27 percent of their body's energy is now or their body
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.080]   You know specific areas of their body are being negatively affected
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.240]   Right here you got there's the issues with the small intestines
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.760]   Specifically the red right there and so that seems to be where it's pretty much concentrated
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.400]   Which is really interesting everything else is blue so there's a lot more stress on their overall body
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:07.480]   But for some reason, you know, it's affecting their small intestines real interesting. Okay, so but 27 percent red is
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.920]   Bad it's really really bad. You're being damaged. You're not just being subjected to toxins
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:17.320]   You're actually you're actually experiencing damage from that bioenergetically
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.320]   Again, I'll go into the whole thing in the other video when I explain the 10 minutes
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.960]   But you know in that in that 10 minute video the first 10 minutes
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.280]   But the idea here is that
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:32.840]   There's damage going on in addition to stressing. Yeah, you're by your body through the toxins in the snow
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:40.120]   Now, lastly now this is step three of the study. They now treat the snow in the quantum block
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:46.840]   And then all of a sudden they retest the individual and all of their markers their bio energetic markers
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:53.320]   Move and just literally reverse. It's a 180 and straight into optimal health in other words
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.280]   The energy the quantum energy it has then removed
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.920]   literally removed
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.480]   The toxic effect of the chemical chemicals in the snow they've removed move
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:09.160]   Sorry removed it so that when your body comes into contact with treated snow then all of a sudden
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.520]   It's like there. It's like there's it's not there. It's there. It doesn't exist anymore
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:18.600]   Your body is not under stress. There's no damage being done. And you're actually showing this is really what's important here
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.000]   Not only did it mitigate the effects
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.600]   Of the toxins in the snow and brought the body
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.280]   100% into the green state, which is optimal health. It's also a healing state. Our bodies are now in a healthy
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.880]   optimal wellness state bio energetically
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.520]   Okay, but it also is your body is now in a healing state
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:47.960]   So it mitigated the effects of the snow, but I also want to point out that the before picture, right? This was the snow picture
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.760]   Here's the before picture
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.280]   Right right here
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:57.000]   I can just center on it. There it is when they were 50/50, right?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.360]   Look what happens when you introduce quantum energy to a person
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:07.320]   Not only does it mitigate the effects of any toxins that you're being exposed to at that moment
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.520]   It also mitigated the effects of toxins in your environment
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:16.040]   So this and all of the other studies all of the other best studies using
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.600]   bio energetic analysis, you know and marine stress assessment again
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:27.240]   reverses the conditions of your environment the negative conditions of your environment on your body
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.320]   And it is it's just a remarkable study. It's just one of many
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.800]   But this is just another example and this is literally the same
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.320]   Results that I've seen in every other best of study
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.880]   And by the way, any of you could go out and get a decavole device
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:50.840]   There's different devices out there decavoles pro scans you name it and you could actually do this own measurement yourself
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.360]   So that if you anyone who questions the results feel free
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.440]   It's really easy decavole devices
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.960]   Don't cost a lot of money and you could literally be doing these studies yourself
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.520]   You could actually see those results happening if people that are wondering like what does a block do?
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.440]   Well, this is what the block does
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:13.720]   It is an incredible tool that energy the quantum energy as it relates to mitigating the effects of toxins emf
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.840]   So forth on your body and it keeps your body in a healthy wellness state
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.680]   So folks keep close to your box. Make sure you're always surrounded by quantum energy
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.800]   For your own health. Okay, that's the end of the story right there
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.040]   So that's the effect right here is one before during and after
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.600]   Effects of quantum energy on chemtrails in the snow
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.000]   And so, you know, I guess I guess people should rethink about playing in the snow
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.360]   If anything make sure you're wearing your heel capsule have your block nearby
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.440]   But you know the whole idea here is that to answer the question the original question
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.680]   That was posed by the member in the chat group is that the block do anything for chemtrails
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:58.040]   And the answer right here in this study by the best institute is yes, it does
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.360]   So there you go. Uh, have a great day and we'll see you on the next study
