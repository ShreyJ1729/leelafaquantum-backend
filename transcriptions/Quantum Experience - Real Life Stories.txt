[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.120]   Kay Elmer and in this video I would like to share with you some real life
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.160]   stories of the quantum experience and what I mean by that are the experiences
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.640]   of users who are using their quantum blocks or infinity blocks for the
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:29.040]   purpose of seeing if they can help someone or help an animal using their
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.640]   block but at a distance and as crazy as that seems you know the the stories
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.520]   coming in these are all unsolicited people are just simply tinkering around
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.880]   but the stories coming back are amazing and it's something so profound that I'm
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.760]   very surprised by it I think other people are surprised by the results and
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.720]   we're all just sort of like trying to understand it and and I want to be
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.780]   really upfront with everybody that I don't have a scientific explanation for
[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.080]   what's going on right now but it's so important that I felt I should share it
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.320]   in this video and document the very beginnings of some of these experiments
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.720]   because the results are simply quite amazing I mean they're not 100% of the
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.080]   time either so there's some there's a lot to learn here but the fact that you
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.760]   can actually affect something at a distance using one of these devices and
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.240]   in a positive way you know I'm just just try to wrap your head around it and you
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.080]   know honestly from a scientific standpoint there's no way to explain
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.240]   this but it's happening and these are real-life stories and I think as a
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.200]   as a tinker and I think as an armchair scientist I think that all science is
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.000]   based initially on on on observation and and and an idea and you know
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.480]   hypotheses and and from there and it goes on and I think that when you see
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.800]   something happen and you even though you can't explain it but you see it it's
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.320]   happening it's real and it's positive then where there's smoke there's fire
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.200]   where there's fire there's knowledge so here you go I just want to share with
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.680]   you so what people are using are they're using these two different devices if
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.920]   you're not familiar with them this is what they look like a company called
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.120]   Lelecue sells these things they're they're basically quantum technology
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.400]   devices they don't look like much but what's going on inside of this that you
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   can't see with your naked eye is pretty amazing and so now what people are
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.960]   doing the actual experiments that people are doing is this and I made a
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.720]   little video and I just posted it on on telegram the other day just to kind of
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.600]   show people this is what I'm doing and everyone's like that's what I'm doing
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.520]   too so here you go just to kind of explain you know what what is you know
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.320]   what are we doing when we say our quantum experience you guys might find
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.080]   this an interesting little tank this is Teddy one of the members dog that I
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.020]   asked for a photo of so I could kind of help the dog with my cube lock so I
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.920]   went a couple of weeks ago I bought this little HP photo printer print right off
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.160]   my phone with a Bluetooth connection then I could just place Teddy in the
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.420]   cube lock and wish him well give set an intent that this helps him of course
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.200]   use some inner piece and may Teddy have some inner piece that's it folks that's
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.400]   awesome and that's really it that's all I'm doing that's all other people are
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.920]   doing placing a photo in a block setting an intent and then stuff happens so let
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.120]   me first share with you some of the things that I've done and the results
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.760]   from that and then let's talk about a little bit about what other people have
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.920]   reported themselves doing and what the results that they're getting so it's not
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.000]   just me it's other people and by the way all of this is like you know non
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.880]   solicited it's just happening grassroots which makes this so amazing now
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.240]   for myself I've just kind of been tinkering around with different people
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.240]   trying different things some people I tell them I'm doing it ahead of time
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.440]   other people I just we coordinate together and so forth and so just at a
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.040]   high level I've done about I'd say you know about I'd say 15 there's some
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.440]   going there's some going on right now that I don't have results back from yet
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.440]   so about 15 different people or critters that I've tried so far where I put
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.720]   their picture in my cube locker my infinity block the yellows are where
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.320]   there was quite an amazing result and it's not always like oh hey you know you
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.600]   know everything got better and kind of result but there was like they felt
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.680]   something that they actually felt something the first one was Jay and this
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.960]   is an individual who's extremely stressful work environment I didn't tell
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.960]   him I was gonna do it is just one of my buddies I knew he stressed out and I put
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.840]   I put him in the cube lock with a stress booster frequency and then checked
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.360]   with him the next day and he was shocked he was literally shocked because he
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.800]   couldn't figure out why he was so calm when there was absolute chaos going on
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.520]   around him I because 100% of the time prior to that moment he'd he would have
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.600]   been you know he'd he knew he'd be feeling all the stress and he'd be very
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   stressed out but he wasn't and he couldn't figure out why he was so calm
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.640]   until I texted him and he's like oh my god you know that's you know that's why
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.580]   and but you know it's it's you know it's just we're we're all jumping to
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.080]   conclusions and I will admit that so you know keep that in mind but that's
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.240]   just that's one example and then here's the thing when you have more than one
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.200]   and you have multiple examples and you start going hmm maybe it's not
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.120]   coincidence right now the the ones that I didn't highlight nothing really
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.880]   happened so I want to point out that nothing happened so this individual you
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.960]   know I mean the response was like me you know nothing really happened one dog
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.240]   did not get better they passed away one person felt nothing my own dogs I put
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.240]   them in in the cube lock and it kind of seems like you know Norman's a little
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.800]   bit more active than normal and Peach is definitely Peach is definitely more
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.040]   affectionate which is weird but you know that I but you know these are my
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.640]   own dogs so I haven't biased and it's really hard for me to judge the
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.120]   difference of something I live with because I live with them and you know how
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.840]   it is right so you know so I don't really don't count like that as as much
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.880]   of a reaction and then of course Chris and I've got some other critters and
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.920]   people that are in the in the in the key blocks now but the other one that I
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.840]   think is more and so I you know that that is just my point that it's not a
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.600]   hundred percent you know it's you're not you're not hitting the bullseye every
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.280]   day sometimes you don't even hit the board all right but you could see on the
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.440]   yellows versus the non highlighted that I'm hitting I'm hitting the board and
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.320]   I'm hitting bullseyes and it's this what's that that's what makes this so
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.840]   amazing now so Ana I put her in the cube lock and she wanted to try the
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.640]   female booster which is that in the woman's booster frequency set that I
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.880]   created there's five different boosters in there right one of the boosters has
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.240]   got a whole bunch of female stuff in there hormonal stuff skin hair nails teeth
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.080]   you know all the stuff that you know women are focused on and and so there's
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.640]   a lot of hormone regulator supplements in that one so I put her in there with
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.080]   that and then she immediately had a retard detox reaction and I had to take
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.320]   it out you know it's kind of like one of those things like I'm having a reaction
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.600]   like okay I'll take it out so we we stopped doing that one that was kind of
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   interesting because Chris I put him in and he wanted to try the men's booster
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.120]   and within 24 hours he asked to beat you know he wanted it's like turn it off
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.840]   because he was having a reaction that he could only describe as too much
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.280]   testosterone so that's kind of a real real interesting aspect of it you know
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.480]   when you're using frequencies and energy not just energy okay so keep in
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.760]   mind that that could happen you know for those of you tinkering around with
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.520]   this and then for those of you who who want to try it to right now here's an
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:53.320]   individual BG BG is a really interesting example this is an individual who is
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.400]   a farmer drives into town obviously every now and then for stuff and every
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.000]   single time because they live out in the world in the Twillies they don't have
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.320]   any EMF right there's like only like one wire coming into their house you know
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.600]   that kind of thing and they don't have that constant bombard of electro smog
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.920]   like all of us living in the city they're not they don't live in a home
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.920]   completely you know just you know just buzzing away with everybody else's
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.280]   Wi-Fi and all that electricity and the cell phone towers and all that stuff
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:30.600]   right he lives out in the Twillies so when he and this is 100% of the time
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.360]   prior to messing around with this right 100% of the time he would report that
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.440]   when he went into the city he would feel fatigue headaches and just didn't
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.920]   feel good right and he could tell the minute he started getting closer to the
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.480]   city and he started driving into the electro smog he could feel it and it
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.080]   happened 100% of the time he knew and he hated going into the city right because
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.640]   he would feel like that so what I tried with the experiment we tried was I put
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:03.040]   him in the infinity block with the EMF frequency and that day he was amazed
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:09.400]   where he could feel no fatigue no headaches and it was 180 degrees how he
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.760]   normally felt every single time he went into the city prior to that moment and
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.840]   since that time I've actually made him a capsule of that frequency and he's
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.360]   wearing it and he has the same exact effect where all of a sudden now that
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.960]   problem is kind of gone so it was not only did I use an infinity block and he
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.240]   lives 3,000 miles from here but now I actually made him a capsule so he's
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.000]   carrying it around with him so I don't have to keep him in the infinity block
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.800]   but yeah that was he's a he's a firm believer now here's individual cue you
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.200]   know and he just was going through a situation where the inner piece helped
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.040]   him you know deal with something that he was really dealing with and he felt he
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.240]   actually felt that inner piece come over him through a situation he was going
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:01.400]   through a Roxy is my daughter's dog and Roxy had some kind of hip surgery thing
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.680]   and you know it's causality right but bottom line is you know I put her in the
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.640]   cue block and she healed very quickly so fast that she had her sutures removed
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.640]   a week earlier than expected and is that abnormal probably not but it's it's
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.000]   something it's like these are all data points of experiments that are happening
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.480]   again you know another dog at the same time that one had no effect put Mandy
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.720]   in there nothing reported put okay this is the most profound and I want to read
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:36.160]   you this person's what happened with this person I put this is a person his
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.440]   name is Adam and I put him in the infinity block with the inner piece
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:48.760]   frequency okay and his father basically you know he wrote up a quick post and
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.240]   then later elaborated to the group now it's all public knowledge you know his
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.520]   experience with what happened with Adam Adam has autism so Adam did not know at
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:03.280]   all zero what him and his father and I were doing in terms of you know doing
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.200]   an experiment to see if we could help him with this quantum technology so I'm
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:13.720]   gonna read you Adam's story in a second and it is the most profound story so far
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:18.600]   and it gives me so much hope on what we could do going forward so you know and
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.840]   this kind this is just an example it's a high-level example I don't want to go
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.000]   through every single one but I just want to point out that I'm trying I'm
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.160]   trying this out on people that I coordinate with I'm trying it out on
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.040]   people who know I can I am doing it but they don't know when and then when I
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.880]   check in with them they're like oh no wonder you know kind of thing I'm trying
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.080]   it I'm just trying it on like here's a horse I got mauled by a dog it was in the
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.400]   paper I felt bad for it and I put the picture the picture of the horse in my
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.680]   cube lock or my infinity block right and then a week later you know and I don't
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.600]   know if it had anything to do with it I'm just saying I did that but a week
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.880]   later follow-up article the horse was healing well you know I did I make a
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:04.040]   difference I have no idea it's just I'm tinkering okay there's a dog at the dog
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.800]   park has a torn ACL I've been I've been putting him in the cube lock a lot or
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.480]   her and you know so far every time I see that poor dog she's still limping so
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.520]   you know it's just it's like I said you're not gonna get the bullseye every
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.000]   time you're not even gonna get hit the board sometimes you know but the whole
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.600]   idea though is that when you do it's pretty amazing and when it's really
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.600]   amazing it's even better than that so that's the point I want to make this is
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.320]   not you know the silver bullet it's not magic but there's something there
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.920]   that's my point and that something there is pretty amazing especially if you ask
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:43.480]   BG you ask you you ask Jay you ask Adam's father right you ask these people like
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.440]   what what you know how did this change your life it's pretty profound so now
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:54.440]   what I'd like to do then is just share Adam's father's I'm just gonna read this
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.880]   out if you don't mind but this is what happened so now this is this is
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.460]   Lone Leaps post on Telegram it's right there in public go to the
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:07.880]   telegram chat group you can read it yourself and he basically says I'm a
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.240]   father with the 27-year-old diagnosed with autism he's the one that K reference
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.520]   I don't know what I was talking about what I was doing his current diagnosis is
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.160]   Autistic Catatonia with cognitive defects the turnaround was now this was
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.320]   after I put him in the first time I put Adam in the infinity block all day long
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.160]   every Monday since then we do it every I do it every Monday I just constantly
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:35.040]   we're trying to see how this could help you know a boy with autism so the first
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.360]   time though this is what Lone Leaps said the turnaround was remarkable as even
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.960]   minor improvements are a huge deal we've seen a huge improvement in the two
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.960]   weeks since K started my son's baseline at that time was some was some explosive
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.000]   rage very low cooperation rates and refusing to go visit his mom three plus
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.600]   weeks it was worse than this there has been no change to his medicine over that
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.800]   time the change has been in a constantly come sorry consistently positive direction
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.480]   he showed a new resilience to pressure to see his mother and new tolerance for
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.240]   discipline for pinching punching ie losing his phone if he didn't respond we
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.160]   were running out of options fast four days after K started he was out of the
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:20.120]   house huge visiting mom very huge and going to a farm where he fed animals
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.920]   mind-blowing doesn't begin to describe it he was initially resistant to some
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.920]   sound therapy that is being donated to him but that resistance has melted away
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.480]   and we are now getting a combined effect hearing him laugh and say sure to request
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.800]   for hugs and it is a million miles from where we were this isn't minor for his
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:45.360]   diagnosis and trajectory in the last few days a result of a generous loan we have
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.480]   been given some access to a Leila quantum tech we are nearing 24 hours with a
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.040]   cubelock updated old tech near him with autism the direction of behavior
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:58.640]   changes are what is important it is a marathon not a sprint but the results so
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.120]   far have been nothing less than a stunning answer to tear field prayers this
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:07.760]   tech is amazing this community is amazing now what's really cool is a
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.720]   couple about a week or so later he lonely provided an update as to how it was
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:17.160]   going because you know as I said I keep doing Mondays and so now this is his
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.560]   latest post from lonely the father of the autistic child we in my home have
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.320]   adopted a word for remote quantum treatments we call it juicing here is
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.720]   some data worthy of a long update we didn't know the day K did his juicing on
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.880]   Mondays for my son I didn't tell him I didn't you know we try to see what
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.520]   happens just you know don't tell people what you're doing and it's even better
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:43.520]   that way and so yeah again he replaced it as autistic kettatonia and looking
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.720]   back over the last four weeks we see my son's Monday afternoons are measurable
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:55.280]   better staff measures seven behaviors daily on a scale one to ten on a bad day
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:02.400]   he may get five tens circled multiple times since K started until today he had
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:08.880]   zero tens on Mondays he got too early today likely before K started but he is
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.760]   in a fantastic carefree mood this afternoon summary by far Mondays are
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:21.200]   his best day before K juicing Mondays were his worst day I haven't coached the
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.080]   staff as to when he is being juiced saying it another way my son's autistic
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:31.360]   kettatonia symptoms come and go life like life which undulates naturally in a
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.080]   frequency of highs and lows are desirable to undesirable my son
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:40.360]   consistently is at the high point of his rage or sorry range on Mondays the day
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.920]   K is juicing his low point has consistently been I'm sorry he's
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.760]   consistently less severe than before K started this remote intervention so
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:54.520]   that's amazing and you know it means that it's not just at the moment that a
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:17:00.400]   person or a critter is experiencing the quantum energy but that it actually has
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.480]   a staying power that it's actually helping in the long run and so you know
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.920]   this is the most amazing story this is this gives me motivation you know to
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:16.400]   keep going to keep doing these experiments to see just how far we could
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:21.440]   take it so I wanted to share with you this is that one story of Adam now the
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.960]   other thing that I do want to share with you it's not just me okay so now if you
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.080]   go out I'll give you the link to the quantum power telegram chat group so you
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.600]   can kind of check in and ask questions if you have but you know the quantum
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.800]   experience is not just me tinkering around by myself with all these other
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.400]   folks but it's other people who own blocks that are starting to tinker around
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.520]   as well and so they've been posting their results so let me just kind of go
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.760]   over some of the results that are that have been popping up on the telegram
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.000]   chat group they can't give you an idea that you know it's it's just not just
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.920]   K armor it's it's several other folks out there and then you know like I said
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.920]   we're either where there's smoke there's something going on and and and I can't
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:04.280]   explain it but you know it's it's beyond cool so anyway with here's some just
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:09.120]   post I pulled off the the chat I'm listen B reports that she's friends dog
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:15.080]   German Shepherd with only 40% kidney function she took some fur a picture of
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:20.240]   him and written intent and put it inside okay and it copied the dog heal
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.280]   frequency in a piece of brass with the doggies name and and then have him in
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.280]   there which is their block he's put him in there every four to five days for an
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:35.600]   hour okay he's nine years old and since she started doing that the dog the
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.640]   owner her aren't sorry the owner's Melissa's friend is the owner Melissa's
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.320]   friend has noticed an increase in energy and that the dog seems more
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.480]   playful the vet is running more tests and hoping the kidneys and the ailments
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.480]   improve and now Philip Holtsendorf which is sort of our quantum sensei of our
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.640]   group he's the owner operative Leila he was kind of jumping into because he's
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.360]   the one that kind of gave us all the idea to do this so basically you know he
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:05.360]   he travels a lot but the other day he said he had he had his own little dog and
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.880]   I don't know if you ever saw Philips videos but he's got those little white
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:13.680]   poofy dog and he had his dog had to be vaccinated so Philip himself had to
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:19.080]   vaccinate his dog and and then but the dog felt awful afterwards and started
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:23.520]   to cry a bit shiver and just couldn't relax and had a high fever so of course
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:29.220]   Philip took a picture and and has an infinity block a second-gen infinity
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.240]   block put her in there for four minutes the picture of her in there for four
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.800]   minutes he did it again and again and and every time that he did it and he put
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:43.320]   it in for a little longer then after the evening treatment then the dog was
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:48.480]   finally at almost 100% recovery started playing and running around so you know
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.600]   he he was very happy to share you know how it helped his dog here's a Malcolm
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:00.080]   in the group he's got a child dog beauty she's 14 and basically you know
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.440]   basically you know 14 year old dog right moves very slowly very carefully you
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.400]   know it's an old dog so he'd been treating the dog with his infinity block
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.720]   as well over over a set period of time and and then after treatment here's
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.800]   Malcolm's quote the last two days beauty has become more active and more eager
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.760]   for attention so it really helped that old dog now here Philip came in again with
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.240]   a testimony from someone else this is all posted in the group by the way right
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:33.080]   like I said so here's Philip talking about a lady who you know is is cool is a
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:38.840]   client of Layla who has a block and she works with people's dogs she does body
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.440]   work on on people and animals okay and so the lady has a hundred year old
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:49.000]   client who comes in for body work regularly and now that this this you
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.800]   know healer has a block she put the hundred year old lady's feet into the
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:57.640]   infinity block for 15 minutes what happened was the hundred year old lady
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.360]   felt so incredibly good after the session she couldn't believe it immediately
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.480]   asked where to get one and quote she felt amazing and never ever had a better
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.600]   body work treatment in her life the hundred year old person pretty amazing
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.840]   and then so now she the lady the healer also worked with four different dogs that
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.440]   same week put them in the infinity block and then all four dogs showed
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.800]   incredible unheard of bettering in their physical issues and their energy level
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.600]   afterwards so noticeable that all owners were speechless and I think what's
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.760]   really cool with this one was that one of the dogs had to be carried outside
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.880]   close to a tree to pee for the last 12 months and then would pee without being
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.280]   able to lift the leg then he would get carried back to the house after this one
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.920]   time in the infinity block the dog was able to lift his leg almost halfway and
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.960]   he walked back to the house on his own you know you know can you imagine the
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:56.440]   reaction okay so what this I just want to point out though this one is where you
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.360]   actually put the dog and the person you know an appendage or something in the
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.920]   block themselves so physically in the block not just a picture but you know I'm
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.800]   just kind of sharing you quote the quantum experience experiencing the
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:13.400]   quantum energy either up close inside of it or at a distance but you know this
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.520]   is amazing this is amazing everybody now Melissa chimed in I think yesterday
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:23.440]   and this is what's funny about this one it was you know she her son told her
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.200]   that Saturday evening he thought he was gonna need to go to urgent care on Sunday
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.640]   because yet you know because bronchitis you just couldn't get over it and was
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:36.520]   coughing now and stop and so she you know he reluctantly you know didn't want to
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.320]   listen to his mom you know who does but she got a picture of him put him in the
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.360]   infinity right late Saturday night for three hours with the intention of healing
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.440]   the infection during the mucus a mucus soothing his throat etc right helping
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.640]   her son and then yesterday morning which was Sunday you know this was their
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.440]   exchange how you feeling oddly better I put you in there this morning so not
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:01.960]   coughing as much no not really still bit when I woke up but the diet but but not
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:07.920]   the dying cough when I lay down now he's a believer he called me this morning to
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.560]   say he slept through the night no cough at all and I was able to go to work in
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:15.280]   the morning this is her son who thought he needed to go to urgent care the night
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:21.540]   before and that's pretty amazing okay and so that's that is just some that is
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:27.220]   just some of the testimonies and the stories the real-life stories of the
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.960]   quantum experience my own other people that I'm working with and other people
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:37.280]   in the chat room and I just wanted to share that with you it's it's it's amazing
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:43.260]   isn't it I mean I can't I can't even describe how utterly amazing it is from
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:47.540]   the standpoint of where we could take it from here and so obviously more
[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:54.800]   tinkering is is necessary and if you have a block I encourage you see where you
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.440]   could take it see who you can help you know you've got an amazing device in
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.240]   your hands you know and and just do whatever you can with it to make our
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:09.680]   planet a better place sales thank you so much you know I don't know where we're
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.400]   gonna go with this but I really am very positive and very optimistic about these
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.200]   early results and I definitely felt they were so important I wanted to share
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.860]   them with you and I want to say thank you so much for taking the time to listen
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.940]   to me and to hear about this and thank you for all of you guys who own blocks
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.040]   that are doing this you know you're helping the world you know God bless you
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.360]   thank you so much and everyone thanks for stopping by appreciate your time
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.740]   appreciate your kind words now if you want to know more about me I'm at the
