[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Okay, well, welcome to another Layla Quantum Tech update.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   Actually, this is our first.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.220]   You know, we've had a bunch of questions recently
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.320]   in the Telegram chat group about different products
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.000]   and about when things are gonna be available.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.720]   And so I thought we would just get quick on the line
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.880]   with Philip and just ask some questions
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.520]   and just kind of see what's going on at Layla
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.720]   for all of you folks in the Layla community.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.520]   So, welcome, Philip, how are you doing today?
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.120]   - Very good, thanks.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.280]   - Hey, yeah, so, you know, I think the number one question
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.920]   I'm seeing in the chat group is the QB Mini,
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.160]   or I, that's what I call it,
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.880]   but you know, a lot of people are kind of excited about it.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.200]   And so, you've mentioned a couple of posts that it's coming.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.760]   Do you know, do you have any more information
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.760]   about when the, like the little travel quantum block
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.360]   is gonna be available?
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.160]   - I think the first batch we may have available
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.720]   in the end of April.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.040]   - Okay, and it's probably gonna be sold out very quickly
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.320]   just because we don't have a large quantity yet.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.240]   We're still figuring out some of the nuts and bolts
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.520]   of the quantum consciousness' levels.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.280]   And we're gonna finish that up probably this week.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.920]   And then, yeah, we can get started hopefully
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.760]   in the second half of April,
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.880]   rather the, you know, probably last week of April.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.880]   And hopefully, pretty soon, this can become a regular product.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.520]   - Okay, so, you know, the question that I saw centered
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.920]   around it is like, like, how is it in strength
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.400]   compared to the regular quantum block
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.040]   in terms of, you know, the dimension of the field
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.800]   and the strength of it?
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.480]   Is it, is it like, would you have you guys
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.720]   been able to measure the field?
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.720]   - Yeah, that's exactly what we're still fine-tuning right now
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.160]   to make a final decision on how strong we want to have it.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.440]   So, I can't give an answer yet in regards to that,
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.440]   but yeah, we will certainly make that available
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.800]   as soon as we can.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.400]   - Okay, and so, but you can still use it
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.680]   as to charge other objects, right?
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.360]   Like you would use a regular block?
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.600]   - That absolutely, you will be able to do, yes, 100%.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.240]   And it's, and you have one, right?
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.080]   - I have the prototype, the smaller one.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.960]   - Yep, and it's gonna be one centimeter larger
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.880]   than the one that you have on all sides.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.120]   - Okay, all right, 'cause yeah, I was kind of thinking
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.440]   that when this is released,
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.320]   that it's probably gonna be different in energy strength
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.440]   'cause it's smaller, which is gonna,
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.000]   which, I don't know, this is what I wanna ask
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.560]   and I don't know if you have the answers yet,
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.120]   but, and then the timings for using that little block
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.480]   may be different than the QB, right?
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.360]   Like, would you need to leave stuff in longer?
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.720]   I guess you're figuring that out,
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.360]   but I'm just assuming that because it's smaller,
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.840]   it's smaller field and that the timings to charge things
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.800]   and to use it to copy frequencies may be different.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.560]   Is that, would that be accurate?
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.080]   That it will be different like you like?
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.440]   - Most likely, it'll be a little bit different,
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.280]   but again, it depends on where we end up with,
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.200]   with the quantum consciousness level
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.040]   and the actual charge that will carry.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.520]   And then, yeah, we'll make it available
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.960]   and we'll tell exactly, is this gonna be comparable now
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.600]   time-wise or not?
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.320]   Sorry, I don't think more information
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.920]   I literally don't yet.
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.120]   - Oh, sure, yeah, maybe we can do a tutorial on that guy
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.160]   when he comes out, 'cause we just finished the one
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.120]   with the QB.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.640]   Okay, so then on the opposite side of that spectrum
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.640]   is this now 12-inch, big thing, you know, big quantum block.
[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.120]   Is it a big infinity block, right?
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.840]   The one that was, that one smoothie stores using?
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.280]   So it's basically a 12-inch by 12-inch infinity block,
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.600]   is that correct?
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.680]   - Yes, that's correct.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.720]   - Is that a new product or is that just a one-off
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.480]   just for that company?
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.560]   - Well, it was a one-off and then we gave it away
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.960]   in the last giveaway and there are a lot of people
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.640]   interested in it, so if we've gotten several messages
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.560]   in that regard, so we're thinking about adding it,
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.280]   but it's, I'm trying to put the brakes on in that regard
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.240]   because it becomes almost overwhelming
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.400]   with the amount of products
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.200]   that the handling is tough, you know,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.800]   because it's all energy products.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.160]   You can't mix stuff.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.720]   You can't, you know, it's not that trivial.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.440]   And from that perspective, I think that will take longer
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.040]   and we were thinking maybe to do a pre-order for this one
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.440]   or, you know, where we say, okay, hey, you know,
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.120]   the ones that are really interested, you know,
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.440]   we wanna, you know, make it available to you
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.360]   and then just tell us, if you're interested,
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.640]   you can pre-order it and then we'll make it once,
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.240]   but we may never have it really as a regular product
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.400]   on the website.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.360]   That's at the moment where I stand
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.440]   because that would be logistically easier to handle.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.840]   But we would then also at least make it available
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.720]   to the ones that really wanna have it.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.480]   - Okay, and then, okay, and then, oh, you know,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.520]   that actually reminds me, for the mini,
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.240]   will there be a pre-order for the mini
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.400]   or is this gonna be, you'll announce it
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.560]   when it's available for sale and it's,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.600]   you're gonna sell it until you run out?
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.560]   - It's a good question though.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.480]   Either way, we could do it, we could just launch it
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.300]   and then we would probably have to tell you this.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.080]   We may just have like 20 or 25 of these
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.360]   and then it's gonna be gone, we have to reorder,
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.040]   but maybe we'll do a pre-order for that as well
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.360]   in the beginning, but that one, we're set
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.080]   that we're gonna make this a regular product.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.320]   - Okay, great.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.960]   And then, you know, the screws, right?
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.480]   We've got, you've just got another product out there
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.480]   that's new is a set of screws that are designed
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.840]   to hold the Infinity Block three plates together, right?
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.680]   So that you can separate the plates without using rods
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.240]   to charge bigger things.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.600]   So you just did a giveaway of some screw sets
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.360]   that are basically the first batch,
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.360]   but are those available for sale yet?
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.320]   Or when will they be?
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.880]   'Cause I definitely need them.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.080]   (laughs)
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.120]   - We'll get them and you're in the lucky position
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.400]   that you're talking to me right now,
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   so I'm committing to send you some.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.240]   - Awesome, yeah, 'cause I do the Jack Newell method
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.800]   with the zip ties, right?
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.640]   But it's just like, I hate dealing with zip ties,
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.320]   'cause when you gotta cut 'em off, it's just such a pain.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.680]   But yeah, yeah, that's great.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.360]   So are those, like, what's the timeframe on those guys?
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.200]   Come in.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.040]   So we have our first batch, and it's not so many.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.040]   So the idea is to add them as an option,
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.840]   when you have your Infinity Block
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.760]   and you wanna purchase it,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.520]   that you can add it as an option,
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.520]   and likely we'll make it as staying the loan product as well,
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.040]   just so that the ones that already have an Infinity Block
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.520]   can also order it, and it's definitely not gonna be
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.080]   expensive by any means.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.600]   We're really trying to just cover the cost
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.400]   of the logistics and the manufacturing and all of that.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.320]   And we thought this is just an amazing add-on
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.440]   for the Infinity Block,
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.560]   because for the people that don't know
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   what we're talking about,
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.600]   the Infinity Block has three plates on the top
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.120]   and three plates on the bottom.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.480]   But if you wanted to put your whole body in it,
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.400]   for example, or charge larger objects,
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.160]   then you need to unscrew everything,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.840]   and it's been a little bit difficult for people to do that,
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.720]   and because you wanna keep the distances of those plates,
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.320]   those three plates on the top and three on the bottom,
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.640]   and people tend to use zip ties and everything.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.920]   But this is what the community is so awesome for,
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.040]   because they had great ideas,
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.920]   and then they started asking,
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.240]   couldn't you make something for this?
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.720]   And that's how we came up with this truth.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.760]   And so thank you to everyone for that.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.960]   And soon, I think maybe in the end of April,
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.080]   we could have the first few that can be ordered,
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.040]   and then probably, I don't know, like the end of May
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.800]   or so this hopefully could become a regular product add-on.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.440]   - Okay, great, and then another similar thing
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.680]   that was brought up in the past,
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.120]   just trying to get an update on a new product,
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.040]   which was the QBlock carrier bag,
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.960]   that you'd mentioned that you were looking to source.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.320]   I don't know, 'cause you were so busy in the last two weeks,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.480]   you might have missed.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.680]   There was this discussion in the chat group
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.200]   about people that are traveling with their blocks,
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.320]   and because they're getting jostled around,
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.760]   that the screws come loose.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.640]   And so we were having a big discussion
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.240]   like how do you tighten the screws down
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.880]   so they don't jiggle loose, right,
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.320]   when they're being moved around,
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.480]   and we were thinking Teflon tape and stuff,
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.240]   but then I reminded everybody that,
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.560]   "Hey, there's a bag, and you could either buy it,
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.880]   "I don't know, Walmart or something,"
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.440]   but you were gonna actually kind of,
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.480]   so is there a status on a bag
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.680]   to carry your Q and I block for traveling?
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.840]   - Yes, we worked on that actually,
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.800]   and that was also an impulse from the group,
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   so thank you, and so we will be getting samples,
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.560]   probably in the next two weeks, I'm assuming,
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.680]   and actually I'll be traveling a little bit,
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   so mid-April, we should have the samples here at the latest,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.960]   and they will already have the mandala on it,
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.920]   so they should look nice,
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.920]   and they're supposed to be exactly fitting for the blocks,
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:49.600]   but I wanna see them really with my own hands,
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.400]   and not just on pictures and everything,
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.160]   and then if I'm happy with that,
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.640]   then I can let you guys know,
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.200]   and then we'll put in a really big order,
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:05.200]   and we may even think about figuring out a way
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.080]   if we could charge the bag in a way
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.840]   where it would contain the fields,
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.120]   not sure that would be something,
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.840]   maybe a question to the community,
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.560]   if that would be of interest,
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.960]   then we can look into that,
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.640]   but maybe it's none of interest,
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.080]   'cause maybe you actually wanna have the full field,
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.040]   even if you have it in the bag, so.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.360]   Oh yeah, that's what I didn't even think about that.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.840]   Okay, yeah, all right, so hey community,
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.600]   when you guys see the video, chime in,
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.720]   if you want the carrier bag to act like a purple bag,
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.360]   which Emma lovingly calls the quantum sleeping bag,
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.840]   I love that phrase, it's a sleeping bag for quantum blocks,
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.520]   so if you wanted to hold it in,
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.200]   so that if it's in that bag,
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.400]   it's not affecting anything around it,
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.840]   or just be a regular bag,
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.040]   so chime in in the chat group,
[00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.400]   and we'll collect the comments,
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.280]   so last product update question is frequencies,
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.920]   right now we've got the full set out there,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.440]   are there any plans to add new frequencies
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.640]   that's coming up in the near future?
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.560]   Yes, a very exciting one,
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.360]   and so we had work actually for many,
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:21.520]   many months already on an ADHD frequency,
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.120]   it's not gonna be called that way,
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.280]   but it's been tested and all of that,
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.320]   but it's been optimized,
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.840]   so it was interesting because,
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.480]   I was always asked to know when can you release
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.560]   this specific frequency and all of that,
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.960]   and I always put on the brakes,
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.760]   and now I know why, because at some point,
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.400]   we figured together with Roman
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.360]   that we actually can significantly improve it,
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.160]   and make it not only for,
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.160]   it's gonna be the focus energy,
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.920]   it's gonna be called focus,
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.040]   and it's gonna be able to serve people
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:01.040]   that have an ADHD or ADHD related problem,
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:07.360]   but also people with dementia, Alzheimer,
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.160]   would be the ones that could benefit from this,
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.000]   and yeah, everyone that's just having issues
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.800]   with focusing and being present,
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.800]   getting into a specific task,
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.960]   or something you're doing,
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.440]   a disclaimer of course, our products are not intended
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.560]   to diagnose, treat, or prevent any disease,
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.200]   I wanna mention that here,
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.000]   is we're not doing anything for specific diseases,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.760]   but we figured once we combined some of these frequencies
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.760]   that really there is benefit that can be seen,
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.800]   and yeah, so it'll be an interesting one,
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.880]   and I think we'll launch it in the end of April.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.320]   - Oh, awesome, okay, so is that different
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.160]   than the frequency set you're working on
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.360]   with the autism study?
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.280]   Is that like a separate,
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.560]   the autism will be a separate frequency?
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.800]   'Cause it sounds like that's something autistic individuals
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.000]   could benefit from having a focus frequency,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.240]   but I think you mentioned in the past
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.680]   that with the study that's being done in India,
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.400]   that there might be a frequency just for that,
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.800]   that particular condition.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.080]   Is that in the works?
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.480]   - That's slightly different, that one's slightly different,
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.640]   and we have that already,
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.640]   not sure if we're gonna put it out there publicly,
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.000]   but we may, I have to think about it,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.040]   because yeah, that one would be very specific for that,
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.920]   but then it would be for a specific condition,
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.800]   and I try to shy away from having something
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.280]   for a specific condition if that makes sense.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.360]   - No, yeah, it does.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.600]   - Don't live in this world where you need to be careful
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.200]   what you do.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.280]   - Yeah, I hear you.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.440]   Okay, yeah, I was just wondering,
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.160]   'cause we do get people asking about it
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.360]   because they hear about the study,
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.040]   which is ongoing, and it's still everything's being tested
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.520]   and evaluated, so a lot of patients
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.960]   are gonna be required on that particular one,
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.960]   'cause it's a one year study, but okay.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.160]   So other than what I mentioned,
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.280]   anything else coming up that you might wanna share
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.200]   with the community in terms of products and frequencies
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.320]   and Layla Q?
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.000]   - Yeah, nothing new except the really big news
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.640]   that'll be out probably in May,
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.960]   and just an update because many people have asked,
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.920]   the DNA and cell protector card has been out of stock
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.360]   for several weeks now, and we've heard you,
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.360]   we've been working hard on it, so also that one,
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.840]   well, that may already be available next week,
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.280]   so we've been producing and lasering currently,
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.280]   so I hope I can get it done relatively soon.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.120]   - Yeah, you need more Phillips in the factory.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.960]   (laughs)
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.600]   - I'm working on it.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.120]   - Your next card should be a clone card.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.300]   Make more Phillips.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.640]   All right, well, thank you very much for your time.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.440]   I thought this would be beneficial for the community,
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.040]   just 'cause so many people asking
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.360]   about all these different things,
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.360]   so this is the Layla Q update today is March 31, 2022,
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.760]   and thank you, Phil, I appreciate the update.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.760]   - Thank you, Kay, I appreciate it.
