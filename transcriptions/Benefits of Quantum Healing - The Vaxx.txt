[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host, Kay Elmer,
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.440]   and this video is another installment in the video series, Benefits of Quantum Healing,
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.680]   where I've been documenting the studies that have been commissioned by Leila Quantum Tech
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.960]   on the effects of quantum energy on various biological systems. This particular video will
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.520]   cover two studies that have been conducted by the Bessie Institute on the VACS. Now,
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.680]   just want to share with you who the principal investigators are. It's Wolfgang Hans Albrecht
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.920]   and Ava Kranke. Now, they are the proprietary clinicians and owner operators of what is
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.200]   officially called the International Association for Bioenergetic Systems Analysis, referred to
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.120]   as the Bessie Institute, and they're located in Austria. They are Europe's largest company
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.320]   that does bioenergetic analysis testing on numerous different products in various different
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.520]   industries. Now, if you'd like to learn more about the Bessie Institute, I have a separate 14-minute
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.600]   video that I'll put a link in the video description below that talks in-depth about who the Bessie
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.080]   Institute is, as well as the process of what bioenergetic analysis is. It's 14 minutes, and I'll
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.720]   just leave it out of this video if you want to learn more about how they do what they do and
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.240]   the science behind it. I'll link that video in the description. Now, I just want to point out,
[00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.760]   though, that in the United States, this process is also known as Meridian Stress Assessment,
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.520]   and also known as Decovole Electro-Acupuncture Diagnostics. And I just want to stipulate very
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.800]   quickly that it is completely science-based, evaluating the flow of energy through our bodies
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.600]   and the energetic state of our various organs and the health of our bodies. And it's all been
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.000]   completely validated cross-referenced against academia science, and there's a lot to it. So,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.560]   feel free to watch this video to further understand how that process was developed.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.480]   Now, the study, the first study I want to talk about is the study on the DNA and cell protection
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.160]   frequency. At the end of the day, quantum healing is several things. It's quantum energy as it relates
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.840]   to biological systems, but it's also frequency medicine. That's another term that's used,
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.880]   and it's in which the frequencies, which are the foundation of everything. Tesla once said,
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.360]   if you want to understand the universe, then look into vibration, frequency, and energy.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.560]   And that's par for the course here in the world of quantum healing, is that there is a profound
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.040]   effect of frequency and vibration in biological living systems. It's all science if you want to
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.040]   look into it. Now, what had happened was back in 2020, if you remember those wonderful years,
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.360]   the Leila quantum tech and all of the energy workers and healers of the planet rushed to do
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:04.320]   what they could do to help people from their perspective on that had either caught the disease
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.600]   at the time and/or further along in that year had subjected themselves to the Vax. And so,
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:20.160]   these healers had come up with a frequency that was meant to help alleviate the biological effects
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.960]   from an energetic standpoint from those two stimulus. I guess I'll just leave it at that.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.960]   Now, how it's described on the Leila Q website is that this frequency called the DNA and cell
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.920]   protector frequency is a carefully crafted combination of frequencies that can help protect
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.720]   your cells from outside stressors, toxins, and other harmful influences.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.000]   This frequency is designed to strengthen your body systems energetically so you can stay vigorous.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.760]   The primary benefit of using this frequency may be that it helps keep your cells in peak condition.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.120]   It may activate the cell's awareness and improves overall well-being by creating an invisible energy
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.280]   field around you that protects against negative influences of any foreign harmful substances.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.760]   So, the study that the Bessin student conducted was incredibly detailed,
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.000]   took a very long time, and I'm going to try to summarize over 200 pages of four different studies
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.120]   that were conducted to the best of my ability and keep it short for this video. So, now,
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:28.480]   this particular study was what Bessin just refers to as Project P74. And it was the study of the
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.080]   DNA and cell protection frequency against specific individuals and specific,
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:42.800]   I guess the best way to say it, is specific components of the VAX that also is represented in the
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.720]   disease had you count it, had you had caught in it. Now, the aim of this test was to prove the
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.680]   functionality of the Leila Quantum DNA and cell protector card by test results obtained by
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.200]   confronting test subjects with stress factors for modern so-called mRNA vaccines in order to
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.320]   significantly improve and compare the reactions without the test object and with the test object.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.600]   The object being this card here, now this card has the frequency in it. Now, subjects were
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   sometimes exposed to and tested with the stress factors in several before measurements and were
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.280]   exposed to and tested with the Leila Quantum DNA and cell protector card in addition to the
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.840]   stress factors in the after measurement. So, in a nutshell, the test procedure was was they had
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.200]   gathered together different individuals who had been vaccinated and unvaccinated. They tested them
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.480]   bioenergetically using what I'd referred to before, marine stress assessments, decivole,
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.000]   electroelectric acupuncture, diagnostics, et cetera, okay. So, they used their tools. These
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.600]   clinicians had evaluated, they were what they call the respondents, also known as test subjects.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.040]   Before, went, you know, like right right off the street and then exposed them to
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:04.400]   these stressors, okay, and then evaluated them during and then after. So, it was a before,
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.360]   during and after, and they took measurements along the way. And so, now, the four different
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.000]   studies that were specifically conducted were detailed in these four specific, you know,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.560]   number group. So, it's the study was P74 and then 1.0 dealt with the effectiveness of the,
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:30.000]   of the, I'll just call it the DNA frequency against various MRNA ingredients, all right.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.600]   Now, the second one was P7420, which dealt with the effect, okay, sorry, efficacy of
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.720]   the Leila Quantum DNA frequency against stress factors caused by the MRNA vaccine.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:51.040]   Now, the, the third study that was done was P7430, which dealt with the efficacy of the
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:58.160]   Leila Quantum frequency for DNA against spike, spike proteins, viral fragments, and graphene oxide.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:06.080]   Now, the fourth one was P7444.0 dealt with the efficacy of the Leila DNA frequency against spike
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:13.120]   proteins and virus fragments. So, it was a very large test, took a very long time,
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.240]   and there, like I said, there's over 200 pages of data that had been put together in these,
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.200]   these, basically these five reports, okay. There's an executive summary here, and there's four
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:32.080]   separate reports that detailed each one of those specific studies that they had conducted to see
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:39.920]   if this frequency would help alleviate the stress on our bodies from, you know, from an energetic
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.480]   standpoint, which ties to the stressors on our, on our organs and our bodies overall.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.440]   So now the respondents that were used in the study, there was seven respondents that were used.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.680]   Now, there were four that had been vaccinated and three that were not. Okay, sorry, there's
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.160]   four that were unvaccinated and three that were vaccinated. I'm sorry, and they were all different
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.960]   ages and different genders. When there's one that there was no gender stipulated, but they were
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:12.240]   all basically tested. The first three was one was unvaccinated, then there was two individuals
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.480]   that were vaccinated. There were three that were unvaccinated that were tested for spike
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.040]   proteins and viral fragments. And then there's an 80 year old individual that was tested who had
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:26.480]   gotten two of them, two of the vaxes, and they were tested for the effect of the test of the test
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:32.240]   object, the card against their spike proteins, virus fragments and graphene oxide. So that was
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.680]   the general idea where you took seven people, some were vaccinated, some were not tested
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.960]   them before. And then during and after now that during part, though, I just want to stipulate
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.240]   was done digitally. So they basically taken the frequency of these of these stressors and
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.360]   exposed these individuals to the frequency of spike proteins, virus fragments, graphene oxide,
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.800]   so forth to see a, you know, what the frequency of these stressors would do to these individuals,
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.800]   because obviously, you know, they weren't going to, you know, give the vax to people who were
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.600]   unvaccinated on purpose to see what would happen. You know, that's not the test. What they would,
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.240]   they would do is they call it a digitized, you know, the digitized spike proteins, or they call
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.840]   it digitized virus fragments in the studies to say, look, we took a person who was quote unvaccinated
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:23.680]   and we exposed them to the frequency of these stressors, right? And then we evaluated what
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.800]   happened to them bio, bio energetically, while they were being exposed to that. And then we,
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.720]   we gave them the DNA card to hold on to, and then see what happens. And the results are just
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.960]   remarkable and kind of unbelievable how well it worked out for them. So now just a real,
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.520]   a real quick understanding of how to interpret the results, because they, and I just,
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.760]   like I said, it's 200 pages. So I'm trying to summarize. So I'm just going to go with
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:55.200]   their color coding of their results for ease of ease of just ease of understanding. So the idea
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.280]   here is that they would use their device. They would analyze 60 different meridians of the human
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.320]   body. Each one of the meridians would tie to a specific organ. And then they, all the results
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.200]   were color coded. We're basically what I want to point out is that green, it just means you're
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:17.120]   in perfect healthy state. Blue means that you're, you're having it's your, your body and your organs
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.160]   are in a degenerative state. That means they're being affected and they're being damaged. And
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:28.000]   then red would mean that it is damaged. Right. So there's the doing really super well. Green,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.680]   blue means you're in danger. You're under, you know, you're being, you know, your body's being
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:37.280]   assaulted by, you know, something that's negative for you. And then red means that, you know, it's,
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.840]   you're past that point of being assaulted, you're now damaged. So I just want to point out,
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:50.560]   essentially green, good, blue, bad, red, really bad. Okay. So the very first one now, which was P7410,
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:56.960]   which where they looked at the effectiveness of the DNA card against the MRNA ingredients.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.240]   And so kind of give you a just a real simple overview of the findings was blue is bad, right?
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.800]   Green is good. They walk in the door and blue is bad. Now I want to point out something about
[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.960]   these studies. And I've been, I've read all of the best studies and I've done all these videos
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.200]   on the studies. And I want to point out something that I think is so important, everybody is to
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:20.240]   realize that every single respondent on every single study, and there's over 60 studies now,
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.760]   where they take a look at a person and just off the street, that's any one of us, right,
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:31.920]   off the street. And we are immediately, and I mean, not immediately, but we are at that point,
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:37.360]   without anything happening, where already most of us are under a tremendous stress load
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:43.040]   from the environment. And that environment, as you know, is food, water, air, all of it's got
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.480]   chemicals and toxins and stuff in it now. And then also to the EMF, you know, we live in this EMF
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:54.560]   electro smog. And then there's this massive assault by our environment now on our bodies.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:00.960]   And then all of us are registering as pretty much in the stress mode constantly at all times.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.880]   So they take the respondents, they take a look at these individuals, and they find that, hey,
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.400]   you know what, this is their profile, green is good, blue is bad. Now, once they basically
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:15.760]   expose the individuals to the M&R and M&R ingredients, then you can see right here that they're
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:21.440]   immediately registering that the organs and the bodies and radiance systems are now under assault
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:27.360]   and being damaged, they are damaged at this point. Blue is stress, red is you're being damaged,
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:33.280]   there's damage happening. And then after they actually are then given the DNA card to hold,
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:39.760]   these individuals or hold on to the card. And after two minutes, okay, this is the conclusion,
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.480]   after two minutes of inserting the card into the measuring circuit, which has been, you know,
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:50.160]   exposed the individual to it, then it just immediately goes to all healthy. So, you know, in terms of
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:57.440]   just 100% reversal of all of these stressors bioenergetically now, okay, and it immediately
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.760]   took the stress off of their off of their bodies when they were holding the cards. Now,
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:08.720]   these are the this MRA, MRNA ingredients. Now, the second test is P742.0, where again,
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.680]   they're evaluating the frequency card. And this time, they're looking at the actual stress
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:20.080]   cause factors by the MRNA vaccine itself. Again, the before picture of these individuals that day,
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.320]   now this happened over a long period of time. So, in different days, they would come in. So,
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:30.480]   now the overall group on this particular day was not doing quite well at their 97% blue.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:35.760]   They measured them now at this point during the exposure to the vaccine frequency. And at that
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:41.360]   point, you know, they were just basically just still stayed in the blue, but then some of their,
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.680]   you know, readings, different organs, remember, there's 60 different readings, 60 different
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:52.320]   radian and different organs. The 7% were starting to show, you know, damage. And then again, now,
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.800]   after two minutes, they were handed, you know, they were basically exposed to the DNA frequency,
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:02.560]   and immediately went to a positive state, meaning no stress. It took all of that stress off
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:11.040]   of their bodies when this study was conducted P742.0. Now, for P743.0 and 4.0,
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.680]   they're extremely complicated. I'm just going to jump over to the study to kind of walk you through
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:22.320]   it. So, these are the five different writeups that are here. Now, this is the 3.0 study. And
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.520]   that study again, I want to point out is they studied the effect of the frequency against the
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:34.080]   spike proteins, viral fragments, and graphene oxide. Okay. So now the test procedures, I do
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.320]   want to point out was that they had the before, you know, they're doing the before meaning before
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:43.440]   they were exposed to it. I'm calling it during. Okay. So there's a before, and then there's a
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:48.960]   during. And here are their questions that they wanted to find out was first step, you know, take
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.960]   up, take a, you know, take a reading of the person when they walked in the door. The second was was
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.360]   they brought them into contact with the listed digitized spike proteins and tested. Now, the
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.000]   questions are that they wanted to know was how does the Meridian system react? How does the energetic
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.320]   status change when confronted with these stress factors? And what are the differences compared to
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.240]   the best of one basic test and before? And that was the basic, you know, was like I had said,
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.320]   basically they want to know, hey, what happens, you know, when you're exposed to this stuff and
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.920]   what happens when you're holding that card? So I'm just going to jump now here. I'm just,
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.040]   here's all the data. I mean, there's so much data. This one particular report is 63 pages.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:30.080]   I'm just going to jump to the very bottom here, where they go over the overall findings of the
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.800]   different respondents. And so I want to point out here, this is the before they walk in the door,
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:40.160]   respondent one, this person's unvaccinated, they expose them to their spike proteins. You can see
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.080]   where they're they're pretty much still in not in a good shape. They're blue, you know, blue's bad.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.080]   Their amount of green is less. So they're less, they're less, you know, it's definitely taking
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:55.120]   that effect. And then even more so, even once they expose them to the virus fragment frequency,
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.520]   then they're now doing less, you know, they're basically getting worse. And then the moment that
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:04.160]   they hang hold on to that card, it goes all the way, all of the negative stressors go away.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.480]   Now I want to point out that the stressors are still there in the test, right? They basically
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.480]   are continuing to send that frequency of all of these different stressors, which show that they're
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.840]   causing, you know, basically stress to the energetics of their body and their organs.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.280]   But the moment that they're holding the card, even with the stressors still activated,
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:31.120]   the stress on their bodies immediately changes and eliminates completely 100% in the green.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:36.560]   So that's repeated here with repondent respondent two. Again, same situation, just different
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.280]   reactions because it's different people. And again, here's respondent three, where you see the moment
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:46.240]   that they hold on to this, the card, even though they're under the effects, right? Frequency-wise,
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:52.080]   bioenergically, bioenergically-wise, they're under the stress of these, you know, spike proteins
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:56.400]   and graph, you know, and graphene oxide and so forth. The moment they're holding that card and
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.360]   they're within the field of that frequency, they immediately go to green, which means that they
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.320]   immediately switch over and all of those stressors are alleviated. Now the fourth one, which is
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.920]   P7440, was again, they did it again. They wanted to keep doing the test over and over to make sure
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.560]   there's, you know, that their findings were, you know, consistent. So they get, they did it again
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:22.960]   against spike protein, as spike proteins and virus fragments. So we go over to number four here.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.720]   Again, this is the test procedure for study four. The same kind of questions is basically
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.160]   take a look at them, but when they walk in the door and then, you know, what I'm calling the
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:37.840]   during, which is the subject is contacted and tested with the listed digitized spike proteins
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.400]   and virus fragments. And the questions are, is how does the meridian system react? How does the
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:48.480]   energetic status change when confronted with the stress factors? And again, what are the differences
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:53.520]   before and after? So again, with stress with test number four, I want to just jump to the
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:58.800]   bottom here and kind of just give you the overall summary. I skipped it. Oh, there we go. And here
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:04.240]   we go. We get into this individual here, walk in the door, not doing well, then completely,
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:10.320]   you know, just not the stressors caused even more stress. And then we see them with, you know,
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:15.840]   there's some before and after improvements with this particular individual where, you know,
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.880]   some of it started to turn green. And then, and then once they have the card in hand,
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.480]   they're 100% green. And that's, this is overall, this is for, you know, the, the overall individuals.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:33.040]   So this is kind of what I kind of wanted to convey. The studies are, like I said, you know, it's 200
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:40.880]   pages of ton of data, but the overall result, okay, was as I have just stated, was under the
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:46.480]   influence of these stressors, whether you're vaccinated or unvaccinated, you're being affected
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:51.760]   by all of these, you know, agents that are now in our environment. And this frequency showed
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:57.680]   on multiple tests, different studies, different ways to, you know, look at it. It showed every
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:06.720]   single time 100% consistency that having this frequency alleviated the stress of the VACs on
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:13.120]   your biological systems from an energetic standpoint. And that is a remarkable finding. And it completely
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:19.680]   validates the claim for this frequency in terms of how it helps you. Now, again, I want to stipulate
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:24.560]   energetically, but also too, if you look at that video about the, the way that they, you know,
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:31.280]   the process that they use, it also ties to the hard science of how well your body is functioning.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.960]   So again, this is a remarkable study that was done by the Best Institute using the DNA and
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:42.640]   cell protection frequency by Leila Quantum Tech. Now, the second study I want to share with you
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:48.320]   today is a separate study that was done by the Best Institute. And this project was labeled as
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:54.560]   P seven five. It was the study on the effect of the quantum upgrade service. Okay, so now there's
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.680]   the first study, which was an actual physical card, a metal card that held that frequency in
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.720]   the card. You could need to get also make capsules out of it and so forth. But this study was using
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:10.720]   the quantum upgrade service, which is a quantum entanglement service that sends quantum energy to
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:17.040]   individuals. Now, this study was just a study on the effects of spike proteins by just getting
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.480]   quantum energy, no frequencies. Okay. So by using just the quantum upgrade service,
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:28.000]   no frequencies and subjecting individuals to the energy, okay, the aim of the study,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.840]   which was consisted of corresponding detail projects, again, was to demonstrate neutralizing
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:39.760]   or harmonizing effects of the test object, right, which is the quantum upgrade service,
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:45.120]   the energy that's being sent to you on test subjects. The main aim was to investigate the
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:50.240]   venom fundamental questions of weather that the field generated by quantum upgrade can have a
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:57.040]   regenerative effect on the exeptopsis on the test subject. I'm sorry if I mispronounced that.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:03.440]   Whether biologically detrimental anomalies from the before microscopies and the effects of the
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.160]   stress factors presented can be neutralized in the period addressed. And whether the effect of the
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.360]   field from the quantum upgrade via the process of quantum entanglement is able to harmonize or
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:19.200]   improve a blood situation or blood alteration that may be detrimental to the health of the test
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:26.960]   subjects. So what I want to stipulate here, this particular study, again done by BESA,
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.400]   but instead of using the physical card, they use the quantum upgrade service. And instead of using
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:38.720]   bio energetic analysis, they used blood microscopy. So they were actually using microscopes. They were
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:46.240]   studying the actual physical blood using microscopes to see what were the changes in the blood,
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:53.040]   okay, physically and not energetically, but physically when individuals were subjected
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.760]   to spike proteins. So now here's the thing that was really interesting. Now the respondents
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:04.480]   there were 24 in this study. Now 12 were exposed to quantum upgrade and 12 were not. They were in
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   the control group. The subscription that each one of these individuals had was the U subscription
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:15.120]   that you can get on quantum upgrade. The time of exposure was 10 days, right? So they would measure
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:21.920]   them. They measured all 24 individuals and then 12 of them after the measurement. They were,
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:27.280]   you know, they had their quantum upgrade subscription turned on. So the U subscription, it was turned
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:33.040]   on for 10 days. And then they measured them again after the 10 days. Now I've actually got the
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.800]   spreadsheet of all the data. And it's just really hard to read. But you know, as I decipher the data,
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:44.800]   every, there were several different groups of the 12 that got exposed in some groups. There's
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:50.080]   not like three people got three, three, three. You know, some got, they had their, their settings
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:56.480]   turned to 600. Some had their settings turned to 1400 on their daytime settings. And their nighttime
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:02.080]   settings, some had 500, some had 900. Okay, so if you have a quantum upgrade subscription and
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:07.120]   you want to know, Hey, what do I need to set it to, to get it, then just realize that the results
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:13.440]   came from different people anywhere from 600 during the day or 1400 at night. And at nighttime 500
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.440]   to 900. That's the settings you would put on the subscription. And that's what these individuals
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.960]   used or told to use on their settings. Okay, now the boosters actually did use boosters was once
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.880]   a day. Some people were doing it at 1100. Other people were doing it at 1800 boosters. So, but I
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:34.080]   think the point that I kind of want to stipulate here is that there's a minimum. Bottom line is
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:40.560]   quantum upgrade service by itself. If you just leave it at the minimum settings, then that's,
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.160]   that's the results they got. Some of the people had them at minimum. Other people tried different
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.640]   settings. At the end of the day, it's quantum upgrade, you service 10 days. And again, there's
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:54.240]   no frequencies used. So those were their settings. And here's the results of the study. Now, the
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:59.680]   before exposure to quantum upgrade, the microscopies of the vital blood of all test subjects showed
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:06.560]   more or less pronounced traces or modes of action on the spike proteins, approximately 30 to 360
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:12.000]   minutes after the blood sample was taken. So they were showing, and that's kind of a scary thought
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.960]   that we're all kind of exposed to this, whether we took a vaccine or not. We're all, we're all
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.520]   affected. Okay, that's a little nervous thought, but keep that in mind. Now, here's the thing with
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:26.960]   the quantum upgrade service, the after exposure, that these the pronounced traces or modes of
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:33.120]   actions of the spike proteins could no longer be detected. All right. And only to a lesser extent
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:39.200]   in the test subjects who are confronted with the test object in the after microscopy. So that is
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:44.480]   profound. Now, they did stipulate and I want to really make sure there's a quantifying statement
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:51.440]   in the study by BESA that says, we cannot recognize the spike proteins as such in a dark field
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:58.000]   microscope. However, based on observations from the electron microscope, we can detect or prove the
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:05.200]   traces of the mode of action of the spike proteins in the dark field microscopy of the vital blood.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:10.560]   So what that means is that the spike proteins and individual, you know, actions of spike proteins
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:18.560]   on cells is so small that just using a regular dark field microscope will not, you will not be
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:25.360]   able to see it. However, you can see the effect of spike proteins at that level of magnification.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.680]   But so they did use an electron microscope to just make sure that, you know, that, oh, yeah,
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:35.360]   this this is actually really happening, but they were going off of the effect of the spike protein,
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.440]   not the actual actions of the spike protein. I know that's, you know, a little bit technical,
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.880]   but I think it's really important for us to understand the level of, you know, just testing
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:49.040]   that's being done. And just how deep that they're looking into these things to kind of make these
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.800]   conclusions. So the summary of this report right here, it's a two page report actually quite short,
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:26:03.120]   was at the end of the day, we're all, we're all being affected by spike proteins. And when you
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:08.400]   are exposed to quantum energy just by itself, there it can no longer be detected. In other words,
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:14.160]   the effect of spike proteins on your cells is no longer being detected once you're exposed to
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:19.120]   quantum upgrade. And that's the results of that study. With that, that kind of wraps up these two
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:25.280]   studies. And I do want to share with you one other thing. This just came out this week. And I was
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:30.960]   talking to Philip, the owner proprietary and founder of the quantum tech. And he was basically
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.040]   telling me that, you know, they are continuing to do studies. Even though there's more than 60,
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:39.440]   there are still a dozen more studies being commissioned and being worked on right now.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.520]   Again, you know, to analyze the effect of quantum energy and frequencies on various biological
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:50.720]   systems. Here's one that just came out. They were looking and this has not been published yet,
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:56.000]   but I wanted to share it because it falls within the realm of this video is that the clinicians at
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   the best Institute using dark field microscopy were studying blood samples live. Okay. And they
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.520]   were exposing the samples to quantum upgrade in a different experiment. Hopefully this will be
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:12.560]   written up and I'll be able to share it separately once this study's been done. But during this study,
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.800]   and this was shared with me and I want to share it with you, the clinicians observing the blood
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:23.520]   samples discovered the exposure to quantum upgrade halted the formation of hydrogel during exposure.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:30.640]   And then but continued to form when quantum upgrade was stopped. Okay. And that is another
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:36.000]   little, you know, it's like another data point in this, this horrible situation that we're in.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.280]   And how do we deal with it? But here is something that I thought was something so important to share
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:47.600]   with you was that not only is there, you know, the issue of graphene oxide and virus fragments
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:53.360]   and spike proteins, but if you any of you who understand what the Vax has done to us,
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:59.040]   there's this other issue called hydrogel. And what's amazing. I mean, this is what they discovered
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:04.960]   when they were watching it was that when quantum upgrades turned on, the hydrogel doesn't form. It
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:10.560]   just stops. It just stops. But when they turned off the quantum upgrade, it kept going. So while
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.760]   it's, you know, so, you know, the conclusions are yet to be, you know, finalized. But that
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:21.680]   observation is very profound, incredibly remarkable about the effects of quantum upgrade,
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:29.840]   quantum energy on our bodies in, you know, in, I guess, in the, you know, against the exposure
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:36.000]   of all of these wonderful things that, quote, trust the science has, has, you know, benefited
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.200]   or basically, you know, bestowed upon us as a, as humanity. So there you go. That's the end of
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.920]   that. There's the two studies and, and the most recent observations done by the Best Institute.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.240]   I wanted to share this with you. And I hope this was educational. And you found some value in it.

[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:07.200]   That's where you can, you know, find that DNA frequency. And then you can go to quantum upgrade.io.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.120]   And that's the quantum upgrade service, which is that's the one that sends energy to you
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.760]   as a quantum upgrade. And then also to, you can find me at the Tinkers Academy, just type in Tinkers
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:22.640]   dot Academy in your URL window. And it goes to my blog, where I have the running series of videos
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.280]   on all the different studies. And it's under the caption of benefits of quantum healing.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.480]   There's many, many studies that have been done. And I've been documenting them
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.360]   for well over a year now, everything from EMF and so forth. So there you go. Thank you very
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.560]   much for watching this video. And have a great day. Hola.
