[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host, Camer,
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.880]   and this video is a further installment in the video series Welcome to Layla Q,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.160]   otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade. This is a video FAQ series
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.480]   to answer the frequently asked questions that pop up in the various chat groups on Telegram
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.160]   regarding the Layla products and the Layla services. This video is to answer the question
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.440]   that we get quite often, which is what does quantum energy do? What does, you know, what does this
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.600]   stuff do? And so for those of you who are interested in the details and I want to just share with you
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.760]   what the source of the information in this video is from. So this is the source and that is that
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.920]   there has been over 60 different studies commissioned to institutes, clinics, universities, independent
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.520]   researchers, and all of these different studies that have been commissioned by Layla Quantum Tech
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.360]   have been done on all of the various devices, so the blocks, the capsules, even the clothing,
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.560]   the frequencies, and specifically also on the upgrade service. So everything, all of the major
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.360]   products and the services have literally been tested by different groups of independent researchers
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.560]   under the literally gold standard of research, which is typically your control group, double-blind,
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.840]   placebo-based types of studies at an NIH level. And all of these studies are totally documented.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.920]   There are literally thousands of pages of reports now at this point. And so that's the source where
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.560]   I'm going to try to give you a short answer in a video FAQ. But if you are someone who likes to
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.000]   get into the weeds of things or you have a particular interest and you actually want to see the study,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.200]   all of the studies are actually housed now at the International Association for Quantum
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.640]   Technology and Frequency Medicine. So right now, this is the repository where all of the studies
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.360]   are now housed. So this is the home page. Of course, all the links to everything I'm talking about
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.960]   will be in the video description below. But basically, you go to the home page of this repository
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.680]   and you just click on go to studies and then all of a sudden you'll have just kind of like this
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.800]   overall just kind of groupings of different studies. And then you just kind of go from there
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.040]   if you want to actually read this specific study itself. Okay. Now, if you are someone who just likes
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.240]   to have just a short summary, this is the short summary. And then there's also longer
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.360]   summaries. I just want to make sure you're aware of the information where I have been doing
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.360]   essentially just on the big studies, I've been doing recaps, where I kind of walk through,
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.800]   you know, the investigator and methods of materials and the results and all that in a video series
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.000]   called benefits of quantum healing. And and that's just been going on for a couple years now. So
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.520]   there's lots of different videos about specific studies in the repository. And also, if you go
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.640]   on the Leleke website or you go on the quantum upgrade website, look under research and you'll
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.960]   have the actual summaries of the studies on the Lelek sites themselves. So you kind of got
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.680]   the answer to this question is this video, which I'm going to go over at a really high level,
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.760]   because the amount of data that supports the answer to that question is huge. I mean,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.920]   it is gigantic. And so we have summarized it basically on the websites, summarized it into a
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.480]   video series called benefits of quantum healing. But if you if you want to get into the weeds,
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.800]   all of the reports live at the International Association for quantum technology and frequency
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   medicine website. So now with that said, let's just jump right in. One of the things that what
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.360]   does quantum energy do? And there's all these different categories, as I showed you, if you
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.160]   look at all the different studies, and they're all kind of categorized, basically animal health,
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.280]   bio, energetic, cytotoxic, food, sensitive, there's all these different categories. And so when you
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.520]   look at the different categories, I've kind of done like just summarize again at the highest level
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.840]   possible to convey an answer to this question is concise as I can. Okay, now that one of the
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.280]   biggest things that the quantum energy has been found to do in the studies is the impact it has
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.920]   on cellular health in a very incredibly positive way. The most incredible aspect that has been
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.880]   discovered this year in 2024 by the University of Tulsa, why by a cellular biologist that did
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.800]   studies and they did multiple studies on cellular health. And the two things that really stood out
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.000]   in those studies was the first one, which was an increase in ATP production. So if you're familiar
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.720]   with cell, you know, biology in general, at the end of the day, you know, we run off of off of
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.080]   something called ATP. That's our body energy, our body actually takes glucose, which is food,
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.680]   converts it into energy molecules and that energy molecule fuels ourselves. And that is,
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.600]   you know, basically, and it's all done in the mitochondria, which is inside of every cell.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.160]   And if you talk to any, you know, you know, cellular person, biologist, they'll always tell you,
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.120]   oh, yeah, ATP or mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, it produces the energy by which we
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.920]   are alive. And so what's really amazing, there's all these different methodologies
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.160]   by which, you know, people that are athletes specifically, they want to increase or ATP,
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.240]   which gives them more energy, right, run faster, you know, do that, all that stuff that athletes do.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:38.160]   And this has been found in the study on ATP to increase ATP production just by being exposed.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.800]   And when I say exposed, all of the different devices and services that I mentioned earlier,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.680]   the concepts of these studies is exposing animals and people and cell cultures and all of these
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.120]   different things to the energy and the energy exposure, it could be whether you're being put
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.600]   inside of a block, you're near a block, you're wearing a capsule, you're wearing some of the,
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.800]   you know, quantum charged, you know, clothing, or you're just subscribed to the U subscription
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.600]   or the home subscription, but you've got that energy coming to you in one way or another.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.600]   Okay, so when you're exposed to quantum energy, there is an incredible increase in ATP production
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:23.040]   anywhere from 20 to 29% increase. So try to imagine, you know, it's just like it's basically a quantum
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.920]   energy drink, you know, it just really gonna boost your energy. And that's what it does
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.600]   at a cellular level. And the other thing on cellular health that quantum energy does is expedites
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.400]   wound healing. In the study on wound healing, wound healing, which was done five separate times
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.920]   to validate the results and consistently across five different experiments on the same with the
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:51.520]   same objective on what is happening with quantum energy on human cells that have been damaged.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.320]   And then they basically observed the healing, you know, the regeneration effect of the cells.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:03.840]   And what they discovered was that the cells are bodies when injured, right, and exposed to quantum
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:12.720]   energy that will actually heal faster anywhere from 46 to 79% faster healing. And that is an
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.840]   incredible, I mean, that is an incredible result. And this has been validated by the
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.840]   University of Tulsa. So quantum energy will give you more energy. I mean, literally more physical
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:30.080]   energy. And it also will help you with your wound healing. And literally could almost up to,
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.280]   you'll heal twice as fast. And that's, you know, according to these studies. Now, the other thing
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:42.240]   that's tied to the cellular health is blood health. And there has been 14 separate studies just on
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:50.400]   studying the impact to blood under a wide variances of different situations. And seeing what happens
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.720]   when, you know, a person, and this is, these are all humans that they're, you know, testing the
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.680]   blood from, you know, human walks in off the street, test the blood, expose them to some kind of
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.120]   stimuli, right, test the blood, and then expose them to quantum energy with or without the stimuli
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.760]   and then take a look. And this is just one of the many examples of someone who just walked in off
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.560]   the street, had their blood taken. And this is just their average. This is how they walked in. This is
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:20.000]   their normal. This is baseline. And then when they're exposed to Wi-Fi, you can see what Wi-Fi does.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.960]   And that's typically, you know, any radiation cell phone towers flying in the airplane,
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:30.320]   et cetera. But the bottom line is it immediately clumps up your blood, it decreases oxygenation.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:36.000]   And it really creates a lot of physical problems to us from EMF, right? But then what happens when
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.520]   you're exposed to quantum energy, is it opens up all of those cells, they completely let go.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:47.120]   And not only are they free-floating and able to, you know, increase, you know, basically intake
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.600]   oxygen better, there's a lot of other factors that are going on. But you can actually see that
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.240]   not only is it better than being, you know, than the condition of being affected by Wi-Fi, but it's
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.640]   actually better than now they walked in the door. So it's so if you just walked in the door and got
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.360]   exposed to quantum energy, you're automatically going to get better. And if you're being, you know,
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.000]   subjected to any kind of stressor on your blood, you're going to get incredibly
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.480]   improvements in your blood. And so now there's a lot of detail on this. So I kind of wanted to
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.840]   make sure that of the 14 different studies, there's one actually really good summation
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:25.120]   on the website. So I kind of wanted to share with you that. And then this is why it's so
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.960]   important because it's our blood. And our blood is what regulates our health, right?
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.280]   So the main thing here is that there was notable changes in blood morphology.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   And those specific changes were a reduction in the presence of parasitic structures and pathonogenic
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:45.040]   organisms. There were improvements in earth and earth or site shape and function. There was a
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:52.160]   decrease in pathogenic activity, lower incidences of ghost cells and agglulinated earth or sites,
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:59.200]   enhanced immune response, and a reduction in science of parasitic infestation on top of
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:08.080]   improved oxygenation. So there's an incredible effect of not only improving the blood from
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.440]   just a, you know, coagulation standpoint, but it also really, really affects the effect,
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:20.160]   you know, the effects of improves the effects of parasites. Okay. And it also really, really helps
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.760]   in terms of just the health of the blood in terms of just, you know, white blood cell count
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:33.520]   increasing of those. So, so the impact of the blood tests and quantum energy, when you ask like,
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:39.840]   what does quantum energy do? The short answer is it really, really helps your blood, which really,
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:45.440]   really helps you in a numerous numbers of ways. Now, the other thing about quantum energy and the
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:51.440]   studies will show is that there's an incredible improvement in overall health from the aspect of
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:58.240]   stress. Now stress in many, in many of its different forms, stress causes a lot of physiological
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:05.040]   changes in the body. And it's depending on the different kinds of stress, but we are always under
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.960]   some kind of stress, and that stress causes physiological changes that are not good for our
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:17.200]   bodies. And so these effects that have been actually specifically studied, and shown and
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.800]   demonstrated that quantum energy in neutralizes the effects of these types of stress. So they've
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:29.040]   looked at cytotoxic stress. They've looked at hypoglycemic oxidative and nitrostatic status stress.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.440]   They've looked at EMF and they've also looked at environmental stress. And they've looked at
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.960]   the stress from trauma because trauma itself has physiological effects, you know, on the body,
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.040]   and from a biology standpoint. Now, when they looked at all of these different types of stress,
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.480]   I kind of want to just go real high level. If you click on any one of these, it's going to actually
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.920]   kind of get into the detail about the study, kind of give you a summary. It says what, you know,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.000]   what the objective was, what the study was, and the results. And then you click right here,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.600]   you would get the actual study itself. So just as an example from the study on cytotoxic and
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:10.080]   electromagnetic stressors, EMF and cytotoxins, they were looking at, you know, the actual effects
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.560]   of the different things that would affect your immune, you know, your immune system,
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.840]   and your immunological responses. And so they were looking at things like cytokines,
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:26.400]   such as firmerins, and inflammation zones, and viproprins. I'm sorry, I can't pronounce all this
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.240]   stuff. But that's one of the things that they were looking at was right here is they were looking
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.600]   at very specific biological effects. And then they studied those effects to see what quantum
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.640]   energy would do. And it reduced them all. It made it better. The other thing too, on the actual other
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:46.000]   types of stress, as I mentioned earlier, hypoglycemic and nitrostatic, nitrostatic and oxidative,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.800]   they also said they also found the same thing. They looked at those specific stress factors for a
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.680]   biological standpoint. This specific one was somebody wearing one of the jackets. And they saw,
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:03.280]   they saw an improvement in the participants bioenergetic status that they were watching
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:09.360]   the actual effects of the stress biologically. And they saw that the quantum energy was neutralizing
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:15.280]   or harmonizing the deregulating effects of hypoglycemic again. So they were actually improving it
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:20.480]   through neutralizing the stress, the effects of the stress, and harmonizing that stress on those
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:26.400]   types of, you know, based on that specific stress factor. Another thing that quantum energy will do
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:33.440]   is its effect on, you know, EMF also on this is an environmental factor. So we are subjected to a
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.320]   tremendous amount of pollutants in our environment, whether we like it or not, they just exist. And
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.880]   there's nowhere on planet Earth, you can't go where you're not going to run into some kind of
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:48.400]   oxide in the environment, which is like aluminum oxide, barium oxide, stronium oxide, you know,
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.360]   it kind of gets sprayed on us if you know what I mean. There's also heavy metals everywhere,
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.200]   and that's just from, you know, industry, you know, living in the industrial age. So there's
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.000]   things like arsenic and lead and mercury and, you know, uranium, all over the planet spread all
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.400]   over. And of course, there's bacteria is anywhere from anthrax, pneumonia, and use earth. There's all
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:14.160]   these things that are either pathogen, pathogenetic, or heavy metal or on oxide that's floating around
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:20.400]   in the environment on top of the EMF. And so they actually specifically looked at these specific
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:27.600]   stress factors. And they also discovered that quantum energy effectively altered the bio energetic
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:34.640]   system, shifting previously deregulated measurements towards optimal ranges, when people were exposed
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:41.120]   to these environmental factors. Okay, that's another really incredible improvement in a person's
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.440]   overall health, just from the environment and EMF. Now, when it comes to trauma, the thing that
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.040]   there was a specific test done on the trauma easy service. And so if you've got that energy
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.520]   coming to your phone and you've subscribed to trauma easy, now there's what does the quantum
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:03.520]   energy do for that. And when they looked at trauma, now trauma has its own biological responses,
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.760]   as I mentioned, that actually kick off different things that are going on. And so when they exposed
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.920]   people to the energy from the trauma easy service, the, you know, the quantum energy, the test showed
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:19.360]   that there was a distinct reduction in stress markers and an improvement in bio energetic
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:26.320]   regulation. They actually measured to the blood serum analysis to reveal a normalized of previously
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.680]   deregulated parameters on the blood serum, suggesting an improvement in psychological status
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:38.480]   of the subject. In other words, they could literally see a physical reduction in the effect of trauma
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:44.400]   on people. So it's all like I said, you know, again, it's just it's every form of stress. You can imagine
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:50.960]   and every single one of them in great deal till we're studied. And it was shown in every instance,
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:59.440]   quantum energy exposure to the quantum energy reduces that stress on your body biologically.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:04.640]   Now there's another study that was quite interesting called the regenerative competence. Now regenerative
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:12.480]   competence was a study basically where they wanted to study the effect of people like people who
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:19.120]   were chronic iron deficiency anemia, people who had pulmonary emphysema, people who had swallowing
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.960]   disorders, or and people who had a hello bacterial infection. So these are individuals who are
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:31.120]   chronically ill and they wanted to see what would happen, right, when these individuals were exposed
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:38.640]   to quantum energy. And so they basically called that regenerative competence. That's the label
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.520]   they put on that specific study. And when they took people who were essentially chronically ill
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.880]   with something, and they exposed them to quantum energy, in this case, they use the travel block,
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.200]   then what they discovered in that study, and this is what quantum energy does for chronically ill
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:58.800]   people, that significant improvements in the physiological conditions, regulatory functions,
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.760]   and energy supply of the subjects. Okay, the travel block or the quantum energy, right,
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:10.080]   influenced the body's regenerative capacity, showing notable improvements in the body's compensatory
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:16.800]   response and overall health. So it was an incredible benefit to these chronically ill people. They
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:22.080]   were able to demonstrate what quantum energy does for you. And lastly, it improves sleep. There was
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.880]   actually a sleep study done with quantum upgrade. And on that study, they demonstrated that there
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:33.600]   was a distinct improvement in sleep. Okay, this is underwater. They definite improvement on sleep,
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.080]   where people slept better, they they fell asleep faster, they stayed sleep longer,
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.640]   just by having the quantum upgrade, you know, running while they were sleeping. And you can just
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.840]   imagine that that effect was clearly just from the reduction of stress on their body. So that
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:55.040]   was the thing with the overall health is it is quantum energy is amazing for helping you improve
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:18:00.240]   your overall health, dealing with all of the different forms of stress, helping your body if
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.160]   you're chronically ill and helping you sleep better. And that is one of the amazing things
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:09.760]   that quantum energy does. Now another thing quantum energy does is it reduces the effects from food
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.880]   intolerances, a separate study was done, where they basically took people who had intolerances to
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:20.400]   glucose, I'm not glucose but gluten, one was done, you know, insulin, so they were diabetic,
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.880]   they had issues with sugar, and so forth, right? And they took people that were they had food
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:30.640]   intolerances, and then they subjected the food, not that people, but the food to quantum energy. And
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:36.720]   when they subjected the food to quantum energy, and then they they basically exposed the people to
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:43.920]   that food, right, they discovered an incredible improvement in the person's ability to tolerate
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.920]   those substances. And in, in, in a lot of cases, it was literally why they were measuring the
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:56.080]   person's histamine reactions, and measuring the person's physiological reactions to the food that
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.680]   they're, you know, they have an intolerance with, they discovered that these individuals,
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.080]   once they had treated the food with quantum energy, they could then consume the food,
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.800]   and it didn't affect them as negatively as as they had been measured earlier. So they would
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:14.640]   measure them once before, and then after, and then after one all the way up to like 80% improvement
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.200]   in their reaction to the food. Okay, in other words, they could start eating stuff that they
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.840]   never could eat again before. Okay, just because they had put it in no quantum blocks. So that
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:30.160]   study is available on the website to take a look at, but it's a definitely one of the most amazing
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:35.600]   things about what can quantum energy do? Well, it can really kind of help you deal with things
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:40.880]   you may be allergic to, or you have a intolerance to. Okay, the other thing that quantum energy does,
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.920]   and this is the most incredible. I know I keep saying that, but they're all just so amazing.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.160]   A study was done on autistic children, and by the way, for those of you who've been waiting,
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.040]   the study has finally been published. It's now on the site. But the study was done on basically
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:02.320]   42 children in a clinic in India, where they were basically helping autistic children. And they did
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:09.760]   this one year long study, using capsules and quantum energy, photos and blocks thing, you know,
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.440]   quantum entanglement, which is like the quantum upgrade service. But the bottom line though,
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.720]   is that they work with these kids. And these clinicians, you know, had approached the quantum
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.040]   tech and said, Hey, you know, would you help us do a study on these children? And all of these
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.480]   children had been, you know, it was completely measured. All of these kids were in a clinic being
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:34.080]   evaluated on a daily basis on whatever scale that they use. For that industry, it was all very
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:39.440]   quantitative, done as a very, very detailed study. It's been written up now and published.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.000]   And so essentially, the study on these autistic kids was what happens when we
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.040]   exposed these kids to quantum energy, and then what they discovered was amazing.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:54.720]   All 42 kids improved in one way or another, and some improved a little, and other kids improved
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.600]   a lot like they started talking. You know, and so this was one of the most amazing studies that
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:08.880]   has ever ever come out was the actual study that shows quantum energy has a benefit on cognitive
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:14.400]   and behavioral health, and that it can help these children's break out of whatever they're
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:19.760]   trapped in, and help improve their physical health, and their cognitive and behavioral health. So
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:26.400]   that is another thing that quantum energy can do. Now, one last thing that I want to kind of convey,
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:31.120]   what does quantum energy do? Is it structures water? So the thing as I was showing you a little
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.280]   second, a few seconds ago, is if you go on the website, there's one study that was done by the
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:42.560]   Emoto Institute. If you're familiar with Emoto, it's Masaru Emoto is literally, if you are
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:49.600]   into structured water or the study of water, his work on water that he started doing in the 70s
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:56.000]   is one of the most pivotal ground breaking work that's ever been done on the study of water
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.160]   in terms of cymatics and all of that. And so one of the things was they submitted the quantum
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:09.120]   block to the Emoto Institute in Japan, and they studied it, and they discovered that the quantum
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:16.000]   energy, the blocks, will structure water. It'll make notable differences in crystalline structures
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   of water. And then the findings suggest a significant enhancement in the water's crystalline structure
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.880]   and energy following exposure to Leila quantum tech products. So if you take a look at the website
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:34.480]   again, you'll see the actual pictures. This is the actual report from the Emoto Institute,
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:40.400]   where they took distilled water, they did it before, they did an after, and then they did an after,
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:45.680]   you know, at basically 10 minutes, they did another one for three minutes. And bottom line was they
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:51.120]   showed a distinct improvement in the crystalline structure of water. In other words, it's structure.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:56.160]   So if you're not familiar with what structured water is, you know, there's a ton of information
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.960]   about what it is, but it's essentially a semantic response to vibration. And the more
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:07.520]   perfect you are, the more structured the water is, the healthier it is for you. And so this is
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.800]   either you can put your water in a block and charge it, or you use try me Z and charge the water.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:18.560]   But the bottom line is if you're drinking quantum charged water, and you put yourself in a block,
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:23.840]   or you subscribe to quantum upgrade, and you are being exposed to quantum energy, guess what,
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:30.800]   you're mostly water. So your water in your body is being structured, which makes it more bioavailable,
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.960]   it makes it more efficient and processing, all those little chemical reactions that happen in
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:40.400]   your body. Structured water is an amazing thing. And now what does quantum energy do?
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:45.520]   It structures water. So lastly, I just want to kind of share with you. There's four new studies
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:51.040]   that are coming out in November. This is November nine right now. So these are coming out later this
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:56.880]   month. And I just kind of wanted to mention this because this is the answer to the question. But
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:02.560]   there's four other things that they've just discovered and they're going to be published.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.240]   And so I just kind of didn't want to touch on them lightly. But these are the other
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:11.360]   things that quantum energy does. And these studies will come out this month. One of us study is it
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:16.560]   demonstrates an actual decrease in parasitic load. Now, when I was talking about parasitic
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:22.640]   in the blood health one, this was a parasitic infections. But these were signs of and incidences
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:29.200]   of and traces of, but this is an actual study looking at parasites themselves, like what happens
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:34.320]   to those guys? What happens? And when you're under quantum energy, right, being exposed to quantum
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.600]   energy, the other one is there's another study on the impact of spike protein. What they're able
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:46.080]   to do is study the blood of people that have been exposed to that. And there's a definite,
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.560]   you know, effect that they can measure, they can't measure, you know, they don't measure the spike,
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.640]   like what's happening to the spike protein itself. What they measured was what's happening to the
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:25:00.560]   blood that's being, you know, in, you know, dealing with spike. So they were looking at the blood and
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:05.200]   people who had it had their blood reacted a certain way that was not the same as people who didn't
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:09.920]   have it. So they could definitely see that there was an effect from spike proteins. And then when
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:15.040]   they expose those people to quantum energy, it reduced it, reduced the effects of the spike
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.520]   protein, just like it would reduce the effects of all that different kinds of stress. It did the
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:25.520]   same with spike proteins. It also discovered that it halted the formation of hydrogel. So it just
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:31.920]   an incredible study coming out this month, all about just the incredible effect of quantum energy
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.400]   on this big issue that we've got now in our society. The other one too, that's another study
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:41.360]   that's coming out is a mitochondrial performance study, where there's this another institute that
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:46.320]   back, you know, had reached out to lay the cue and asked to do a study. And they've done a study
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.960]   now and they're about to produce the report where they basically demonstrate and they're studying the
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:56.640]   mitochondrial or the mitochondria itself. And the performance of the mitochondria with the exposure
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:02.240]   of quantum energy has been it just basically the the high level responses that it greatly improves
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:08.480]   mitochondria performance. And especially in the area of like cell danger responses and things like
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:14.560]   that. So there was an incredible improvement in in your way that your mitochondria is performing
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:19.280]   when exposed to quantum energy. Then the last thing about what does quantum energy do? There's
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.360]   another study coming out again this month. There's four of them. The last one is an improvement in
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.920]   women's health and fertility. They studied a bunch of ladies at an actual fertility clinic.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:33.360]   And they exposed, they, you know, before and after exposure to quantum energy. And the study is
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.560]   going to be showing us like exactly what improved in these ladies health and what improved in their
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:44.800]   fertility. So these are four more things that are what quantum energy does that are that are that
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:50.240]   will be released here this month in terms of demonstrating the incredible, incredible properties
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:55.200]   of quantum energy. So that's it. And sorry for the really long answer. It's as hard. It's really
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:01.680]   hard to summarize over a thousand pages. Actually, it's thousands of pages at this point. But I just
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:07.040]   wanted to kind of give you the highest level I could bullet point by bullet point. What does quantum
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:13.040]   energy do? And that's the answer. And if you want to look at the studies themselves, I'll give you a
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:18.960]   link to the website in the video description below. So anyway, thank you so much for listening to
