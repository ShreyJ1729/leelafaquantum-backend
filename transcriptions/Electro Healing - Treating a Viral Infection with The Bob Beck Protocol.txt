[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940]   Aloha, everyone, and welcome to another ElectroHealing video by me, Kay Elmer.
[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.200]   And in this video, I'd like to share with you how to treat a viral infection with a
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.400]   Bob Beck protocol.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.760]   Before I get into any of the content, I need to go over the disclaimers with you.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.760]   And I do apologize.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.520]   It's kind of long this time due to the nature of the content that I'll be sharing.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.520]   Please bear with me.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.920]   I need to read this, and then we can jump right in.

[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.240]   no financial relationship with any of the products displayed in this video.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880]   Okay, so let's move right in.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.680]   Ooh, that was lengthy.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.680]   Okay.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.760]   The first thing you need to know, and this is where I want to throw this up front, is
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.640]   that there are cautions and warnings about using the Bob Beck protocol.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.400]   And before I describe what it is and how to do it, let me go ahead and cover this.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.560]   This is the most important thing.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.000]   So if any of this applies to you, then you probably don't need to watch the video, so
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   let me save you some time.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.440]   First of all, if you've got an electronic implant somewhere in your body, whether it's
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.760]   in your head, your heart, whatever, if you've got electronics inside you, don't do this,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.840]   because you are essentially going to connect a blood electrifier and pulse voltage through
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.160]   your bloodstream.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.600]   So not a good idea.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.480]   If you're a child, or I doubt if children watch my videos, but if you're children and
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.720]   pregnant women, there's that classic disclaimer.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.040]   There's not enough research and it's just too risky.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.240]   Do not recommend.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.400]   Do not try this.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.020]   I just do not think it'd be a good idea.
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.480]   If you are immune compromised and you need to have your dependent on intraday medication,
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.200]   meaning you take medication throughout the day and you need it all the time, then you
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.360]   should absolutely not do this, because one of the things about the Bob Beck protocol
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.040]   is it uses blood electrification, and that process creates a situation called transfection.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.040]   Because of the frequency and the voltage and the amperage that's being pulsated through
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.540]   your bloodstream in what it does, which is it eliminates pathogens, when that is actually
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.480]   occurring, then transfection occurs through a process called electroporation.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.480]   I apologize.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.000]   There's a lot of words coming out right now that I'm not defining.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.600]   But bottom line is that if you're on medication or if you're immune compromised, you may kick
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   off a detox reaction that your body may not be able to compensate for and it will make
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.920]   you terribly, terribly ill.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.280]   Or if you are on medication and through electroporation, then you will have a massive dose of that
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.400]   medication far beyond what you've actually taken because of that function called transfection.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.680]   So between these two things that could possibly happen, well, actually, not possibly, they
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   do happen.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.760]   If you're on any one of those situations, then you're going to get very ill and it's
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.240]   not going to be a very good thing.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.200]   So, not for you.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.880]   Now I did transfection simply means that if you take, let's say you take a telenol and
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.120]   then you zap your blood, you're going to get a ten times dose of that telenol inside
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.120]   of you.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.840]   And you can imagine what it would do to somebody's liver and/or if you were having problems,
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.840]   right?
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.840]   Or you were on some other medication.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.360]   The Herxheimer reaction is a detox reaction when your body is overwhelmed by and essentially
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.460]   what's going to happen, it's going to basically neutralize all the pathogens that goes past
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.760]   where the probes are.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.720]   And that excess load on your detox process within your body, your immune system has to
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.240]   process it, it has to flush it out of you.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.120]   And if you overwhelm your immune system and your lymphatic system with excess dead pathogens,
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.680]   trying to find a way out of you, then you will go into a horrible detox reaction.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.200]   And it's called the Herxheimer reaction.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   And also last thing is the skin damage.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.560]   There's a possibility of damaging your skin if you do it wrong.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.360]   And so I'll cover that in the tips on how to use the probes.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.440]   But bottom line though is you have to be very, very careful and you could damage your skin.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.960]   You could either burn your skin, you could give yourself a rash, or you actually could
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.800]   cause a little bit of nerve damage if you just use the machine at too high of a volume,
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.000]   you know, at a power level.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.720]   And so there is that possibility as well.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.000]   And I'm sorry, I just want everyone to know, these are all the things you really need to
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.400]   understand.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.680]   You know, I mean, and I would say that, you know, clearly the majority of people could
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.840]   do this without issues.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.740]   But there are some that have problems and issues.
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.160]   And these are the things you need to know about because I want to just be really transparent
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.280]   and really upfront about this whole situation.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.280]   Okay.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.680]   However, let me show you something that I think is quite remarkable.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.040]   I'm a little bit of a nerd.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.080]   And so I do a lot of spreadsheets and things like that all the time.
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.200]   And one of the things I also do is I keep a journal of my sick days.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.800]   And so I went to go look at it because I was thinking about the effect of me doing Bob,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.960]   you know, the Bob Beck protocol, whenever I started to feel ill and since I started
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   doing it.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.880]   So, and then, you know, what was my life like before that timeframe?
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.560]   So I happen to have a minimum, I have 12 years of records going back to 2008.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.040]   So it actually went to like middle of 2007, but I threw that data away.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:08.080]   So I've got full year records of the number of days that I was ill and this does not include
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.080]   getting injured.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   Okay.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.160]   Just ill from 2008 to 2019, that's a total of 12 years.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.920]   And now about, I'd say around around, you know, around 2012 is kind of when I became
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.160]   a little woke about taking better care of myself and self treating and so forth.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.360]   And from that moment on around those time frames, I began using the Bob Beck protocol.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.200]   So I want to just point out, now these are just the number of sick days over the years.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.720]   And I want to point out something I think is very important.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.920]   When you take a look at these 12 years right here and you look at the last six years, the
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.600]   number of days I was out per year was an average of 3.7.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   Now the prior six years before I started doing the Bob Beck protocol, the number of days
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   absent per year average was 6.2.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.880]   This is over a 12 year time span.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.400]   Now what that means is since I've been doing the Bob Beck protocol, every time I even get
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.840]   the little bit of the sniffles or a cough or anything like that, over the last six years
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.880]   compared to the prior six years before that, I've reduced the number of sick days or sick
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.560]   occurrences by 40%.
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.200]   That's 40% reduction in being sick.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.980]   And the impact of that on not calling out, of not having to gel poops to pick up drop
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.560]   off kids, you know, when you're sick.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:33.880]   And it's just a huge improvement in my health and just the improvement in just overall just
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.200]   general efficiency in terms of functioning.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.520]   So I just wanted to share with you some hard data because I actually have data on how well
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.600]   the Bob Beck protocol has been working for me in terms of keeping me healthy.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:51.800]   You can actually see where I have days like three years here with zero sick days compared
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.480]   to all these other years where I never missed a year being sick.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.600]   And so I think this is quite important to recognize.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.600]   Okay.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.160]   So that's just some data just to share with you about the Bob Beck protocol.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.600]   So now what I want to do is share with you something I think is really, really important
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:13.320]   because when it comes to viral infections or any type of pathogen infection, bacterial
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.440]   or I would say more so let's just focus on viral.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.680]   That's the purpose of this video.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   Sorry.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.680]   Didn't mean to go off on a tangent.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.020]   Talk about viral infections.
[00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.960]   This is your typical and courtesy of MN Health.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:34.280]   This is your typical mainstream medical response to a viral infection.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.280]   And I just want you to just hear it firsthand.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.080]   When people have a viral infection, sadly, there's not much to do other than to rest,
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.080]   drink fluids.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.240]   As a parent, when you have a sick child, it's really tough because you want to do something
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.800]   for your child.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.380]   And honestly, the best thing is to give them lots of tender loving care and give them some
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.080]   comforting medications that are over the counter just to help take care of the symptoms
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.600]   that we're suffering from.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.520]   But antibiotics won't help in those cases.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.520]   So there you go.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.640]   You know, it's kind of true.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.040]   There is no, the most that they can give you is antivirals like Tamiflu.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.200]   But at the end of the day, they're going to just treat the symptoms.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:19.720]   This is mainstream medical science basically saying when people have a viral infection,
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.440]   sadly, there's not much else to do.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:29.080]   Go home and take some drugs that will treat the cough, that will treat the sinus issue,
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:35.520]   but not do anything to eliminate the virus infection that you've got in your body.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.520]   So is that true?
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.600]   This is my question to the world.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.120]   Is that a true statement?
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.080]   Well, let's take a look.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:48.880]   In 1990, two doctors from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York filed a patent
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:56.840]   number US 5139684A that basically was titled electrical, electrically conductive methods
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.680]   in systems for treatment of blood and other fluids and/or synthetic fluids with electric
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.080]   forces.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:09.280]   So what these two doctors had discovered back in 1990, okay, 30 years ago, was a new process
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.520]   in system for treatment of blood and/or body fluids and/or synthetic fluids from a donor
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.480]   or recipient or storage receptacle, or in a recycling system using novel electricity
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:24.160]   conductive treatment vessels for treating blood and other body fluids and/or synthetic
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.760]   fluids with electric field forces of appropriate electrical field strength to provide electric
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:35.300]   current flow through the blood and other body fluids at a magnitude that is biologically
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.120]   compatible but is sufficiently.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:48.960]   To render the bacteria, viruses, and/or fungus ineffective to infect normally healthy cells
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.280]   while maintaining the biological usefulness of the blood or other body fluids.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:11:00.680]   So what this patent proved because they had to prove what they're saying in a patent.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.360]   So they proved it, they filed a patent for it, and they got the patent for it that said,
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:13.840]   hey, guess what world, we found a way to make pathogens, bacteria, viruses, and fungus ineffective
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.940]   to infect healthy cells but maintain their biological usefulness.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:25.720]   Now the patent that they had filed essentially says you need to take, if you take the blood
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:32.000]   out, run it through this blood electrifier device and then pump the blood back in, you
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.360]   know, you're going to kill off everything, you're going to actually not kill off, but
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.800]   you're going to render them ineffective or let's say neutralize.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:45.520]   This patent is the beginning of what is called the Bob Beck protocol.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:51.240]   So this is in 1990, so a gentleman by the name of Bob Beck decided that he read that
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.480]   patent and he decided he was an electrical engineer and he held several patents of his
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:01.600]   own and he decided to take it one step further and he developed a different type of blood
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.920]   electrifier that did not require you to take your blood out of your body.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.280]   So this is something that you could literally, and because he was an electrical engineer,
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.560]   you could do it home if you have this little device and then what he did, which was the
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.000]   most remarkable thing that he did, and this is back in the early 1990s, like 30 years
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.360]   ago, was he open sourced it.
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.560]   He decided that this was so important in the world that you could have a little tiny device
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:30.160]   that could basically kill all different kinds of pathogens in you and cure you, right?
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:37.240]   There's that amazing word cure of you of any bacterial virus or fungus mold infection with
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.960]   just a tiny little electrical device that he open sourced it.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.640]   He put the schematics out in the world and said, "Hey, here you go, world.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.120]   Go ahead and build these own."
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:52.120]   And for the 1990s, he basically went around to multiple different medical conferences,
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:58.000]   I guess, they're not really medical conferences, but hackers and tinkerers of the day, and
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.640]   he went around and he did a bunch of lectures.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:07.520]   And I want you to hear Bob Beck himself speak about this incredible discovery that he made
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.160]   and what it meant to him.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.600]   So now this is a really old video from back in the day, and I want you to just hear the
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.920]   very beginning of this, okay, so that you can hear from his little words.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:28.720]   They present in the cure for AIDS, and it was immediately suppressed, quite.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.120]   This is a package of Wrigley's chewing gum.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.000]   When I was a kid, it cost a nickel.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.440]   When I bought one at the John Wayne Airport before I was flying these traditionally, it
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.840]   cost a dollar eight cents.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:55.800]   This package of chewing gum represents the entire cost of curing HIV, cancer, Epstein
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:01.900]   Barr, hepatitis, even herpes, that takes about five months.
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.880]   These others take about three weeks, and this is proven, and we'll prove it to you before
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.040]   you leave the room tonight.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.880]   So my one problem is show.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.520]   All right, I'd like to just leave it right there if you heard what he said.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.680]   It included HIV, which is a virus, obviously.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:23.080]   So back in the day, Bob Beck toured a bunch of different conferences, and he gave this
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.760]   speech, all of these videos are on YouTube.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.160]   In fact, just as a reminder, every single thing I'm going to walk you through the ton
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.160]   of leak.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.120]   There's more research in this one video than any other of my videos except for maybe this
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:47.240]   other one, but I cannot stress enough how incredible Bob Beck's invention was.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.560]   And he's talking about the cost of the parts where he would basically give you a schematic
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.620]   and you would go and buy electronic components for a buck and then build these things yourself.
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:58.580]   This is obviously 30 years ago.
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.400]   And then he actually had a handout when you would show up to one of these, and somebody
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.600]   was, you know, by the grace, right, of angels.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.600]   Somebody held on to one of those handouts, and they made a photocopy of it, and they're
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.360]   floating around the web right now.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.480]   And it's literally the actual handout from their lecture, and it's the Bob Beck lecture,
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.800]   and he named his lecture, "Take Back Your Power."
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:24.440]   And now, of course, there is a link to this handout in the video description.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:30.920]   So what this simply means is that he developed a way using the idea in the patent from the
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:37.040]   Albert Einstein Clinic Institute, and he used that, created a device that could do what
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.680]   he just described, which would neutralize any pathogen in the bloodstream.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:47.120]   And so this is the story of how that's going to work and how to go about doing it.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.620]   Now the first thing you need to understand about the Bob Beck protocol, it's actually
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.240]   four separate protocols combined into one.
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:00.320]   So when, and then if you actually watch his videos, or you watch his, you know, his lectures,
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.960]   you know, they start in the early '90s, and they end around 2000, and I believe he passed
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.720]   away in 2008 or 1998 or something like that.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:15.200]   But as he went along in time, from the moment that he discovered blood electrification, as
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:20.520]   he progressed through time, he added on more and more different steps so that originally
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.880]   he just started with blood electrification, and then he added on Clodal Silver, and then
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.880]   he added on Ozone, then he added on PMF.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.720]   And then this bottom part here is just, is what I do as well.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:37.240]   But the four major steps is what ended up becoming the Bob Beck protocol.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.180]   And actually, somebody, there's another book out there called "The First Aid Kid of the
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.540]   Future" that somebody wrote a book about Bob Beck and his protocol.
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.940]   If you want to go and find that, I think there's a link in that too as well.
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.000]   So let me describe to you what the four are.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.580]   Now this is blood electrification.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:57.140]   I did a full video on this, and what blood electrification does in step one of the protocol
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.700]   is it neutralizes pathogens, just like that patent set.
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:06.700]   So if any virus or any bacteria, any mold or fungi comes into that field of where the
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:10.500]   probes are, it'll neutralize them, it'll make them ineffective, they will not be able
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.820]   to latch onto healthy cells, and will not be able to infect you.
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.020]   And then your lymphatic system will then flush them out of you.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:22.420]   And it does also, and what it also does too, because it's electricity, it actually kicks
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.780]   off a process called electroporation.
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:29.820]   And electroporation is when you have a normal cell, and the cell wall is kind of like a
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.620]   membrane, like let's say a ping-pong ball, right, it's really smooth all the way around.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:42.780]   Now when an electricity passes through that cell, it basically morphs into what you would
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:47.860]   look like visually as a little golf ball with all these little divots in it, and the
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:53.940]   divots on the outside of the cell are just where the cell wall has thinned.
[00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.060]   And it just does that, it just kind of spasms for a short brief time, and it kind of opens
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:03.340]   up and it becomes more porous so that anything that's floating around that cell is now able
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:07.540]   to kind of penetrate that cell through those little divots in the cell wall, and then it
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.060]   closes back up again.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:15.060]   Now because of electroporation, what Bob Beckdette did, and this is the thing too, if you listen
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:20.020]   to his lectures and you read his writings, he really started trying to get people to
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.380]   understand how important this was.
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:29.060]   And so people obviously were not receptive to the idea because you couldn't patent it,
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.940]   and it's not a drug, and that seems to be the way everything goes nowadays, but he was
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.500]   adamant, and he literally spent over $100,000 of his own money.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.580]   He went out of the country and he did his own human trials, and this is how he learned
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.300]   what the protocol should be.
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.740]   And you'll hear that, you'll hear him talk about that in his lecture.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:51.740]   So when he added Clodal Silver, because silver has the properties to be able to kill pathogens,
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:52.740]   and so he added that.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:58.020]   So the idea was, is that when the blood electrifier is working, it's neutralizing pathogens, but
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.660]   at the same time, it's electing parading the red blood cells and the white blood cells.
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:05.640]   So then if you have Clodal Silver in your bloodstream at the same time, because it's
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:11.740]   electro-parading, it'll be able to absorb the Clodal Silver, the ionic silver particles,
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:17.180]   much easier into the cell, and then eliminate any viruses that are inside the cell.
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:21.460]   And so it really gave it a boost up and really made the protocol that much better.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.940]   And then he added on Ozone.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:30.420]   Ozone is, as you know, there's a huge warning about Ozone, but it's always about breathing
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:37.060]   Ozone gas, which is 03, Oxygen, three atoms of Oxygen in 103.
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:42.900]   But if you bubble Ozone in water and then drink the water, what happens is when that
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.940]   water comes in you, you know, there's three Oxygen atoms connected together, and it always
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.900]   wants to go back to being a gas, it's very unstable.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:56.980]   And so one of the Oxygen atoms will release off to create an 01, and then the gas is the
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.980]   02.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.340]   That little 01, well, it's a free radical.
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.860]   It's what we always try to avoid.
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:07.260]   That's what we're taking C60 and it causes aging and all this other stuff.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:15.660]   But what it also does is it kills pathogens because oxygen will kill any type of pathogen
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.660]   that it encounters.
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.980]   So if that 01 hits a, you know, like it does as much damage to your healthy cells as it
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.980]   does to pathogens.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.820]   So if you've got a heavy pathogen load and you release all this 01 into your system,
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.300]   you know, while your body's dealing with the free radicals, it's killing off all the
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.740]   pathogens in your body at the same time.
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:37.020]   And it's also something that's really amazing is that it's an immune modulator, a scientist
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:42.580]   that have discovered that by drinking ozone water or doing ozone with the call in suffocation,
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:48.220]   which is essentially, you know, putting ozone gas through the bottom half of you to put
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:54.780]   it easy, then your body then actually has an immune response to the ozone and it actually
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:21:00.380]   kicks off different processes in your body and actually is good for trying to motivate
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:05.860]   and actually stimulate your immune system and beef you up a lot more about being, you
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.680]   know, having a stronger immune system.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.300]   So that was the second thing that he had added to the blood electrification protocol.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:18.060]   And then eventually he went to using the, which is a magnetic pulser, which is also
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:25.380]   PEMF and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy, and so what PMF did or these magnetic pulsers,
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:29.020]   what he did was, and this was the thing, he started all off with trying to figure out
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:33.340]   how to cure AIDS because back in the 90s, for those of us who are old enough to remember,
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:38.500]   that was the, let's say the coronavirus of the day, right, it was like, oh, it was AIDS
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.940]   was the big, the big thing before anybody worried about anything else.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:50.180]   And so he was trying to treat AIDS patients and kill the HIV virus and what he discovered
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:55.140]   over time, which was several years into it, where he had been building together this protocol,
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:00.820]   he discovered that the AIDS virus, just like, let's say the chickenpox virus will lay dormant
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:05.180]   in different parts of your body and kind of hide from, you know, it's self protective.
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.340]   These things are not stupid.
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:12.340]   They've evolved with us as a species and so the virus, the HIV virus, would lay dormant
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:17.260]   in the lymphatic system in certain parts of the body, so what was happening was he would
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:22.020]   treat people with the Bob Beck protocol, especially HIV patients, and they would get
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.300]   way better and then they would go away, would come back months later and they'd be sick
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.300]   again.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.300]   And they were trying to figure out why are you sick because we basically wiped everything
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.300]   out of you.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.700]   We did the tests and you showed none, but what happened was they showed none because
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.700]   they were testing the blood, but what they realized was that the HIV virus was able to
[00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.460]   hide out and literally go to the farthest reaches of the lymphatic system.
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.180]   So what Bob Beck decided to do, and this is what worked for him, and this is what worked
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:49.300]   in the protocol through his human trials, which by the way, it's so terrible, he never
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.780]   published because he wasn't a scientist, you know, he was an engineer, so he didn't
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.020]   publish his results, but he talks about them in his lectures.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:02.180]   So with the magnetic pulser, what he did was he added a fourth step to the protocol,
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:08.380]   which by, you would use a magnetic pulser and you would pulse the six major lymphatic
[00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:13.900]   glands on your body, and by doing that, he discovered that that would completely eliminate
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:18.820]   the HIV virus and that people would actually be cured.
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.340]   Interesting how you've never heard that before, right?
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.140]   Yes, there's a cure to HIV.
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.820]   So that was the Bob Beck protocol, and these are the four steps.
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:31.380]   Now I've done a, I've done my own type of modification where I've just, I've just some
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:36.100]   tinkering around, and I've discovered that in the area of the step two, which is you
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:41.060]   want another, you want an element that will kill off the pathogens, not just neutralize
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.060]   them.
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.820]   I've also learned that vitamin C because of the tremendous and credible value of vitamin
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:52.180]   C, vitamin C will also work very well, and it's interchangeable with Clodal Silver.
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:57.020]   So for those folks, you know, because the Clodal Silver or ionic silver world, there's
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:01.580]   kind of like two fields of study, one group really believes in it, another group doesn't
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:06.540]   think it works, no problem, then just substitute it with liposomal vitamin C, and you will
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:07.540]   see the same results.
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.940]   Okay, so I've done that.
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.300]   As a tink, I've tried to see, you know, well, can you substitute these?
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.900]   And then if you are really sick, and this is what I call mega-backing, if I'm really
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:20.980]   really sick, I mean, like, like there was just one part where I was literally bronchitis
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:25.180]   coughing blood, you know, kind of that sick about to have pneumonia.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:30.780]   And so I decided I would do a quote mega-back where I actually did all five of these, plus
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:36.340]   I upgraded, I have a medical grade ozone machine with an oxygen concentrator, so I used not
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:41.140]   my regular ozone generator, but I used a medical grade ozone generator, added liposomal
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.740]   C, I did all of this all at the same time, twice a day.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:50.500]   I mean, it was like full-on, just go for it, and I was perfectly fine a week later.
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.700]   So this is the actual protocol, and this is how you do it.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.860]   So let me walk you through how to do this, and then for those of you that want to stick
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:03.460]   around, we can actually go through the research on what it does specifically and how it works,
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.180]   but I just wanted to kind of cover this with you, all right?
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.420]   So now, the very first thing that, you know, that everybody really should know is what
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.180]   this stuff costs, and so I want to point that out.
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:17.820]   Now, if you wanted to do the blood electrification, the ozone generator, you know, basically
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:25.900]   your basic package, your basic four-step, Bob Beck protocol, there's different ranges
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:30.060]   best based on what equipment you buy, what supplies you buy, and so forth.
[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:35.860]   So for a blood electrifier, it's anywhere from, you can buy just a good enough model that
[00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.780]   works just fine as low as 8850, or you could just go and just go all out and get one that
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:45.660]   does multiple different things, and it has little fancy armbands in the whole bit, right?
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:50.460]   So it could get expensive, the ozone water generators, if you go on Amazon, anywhere from
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:56.180]   50 to 100 dollars, magnetic pulses are the most expensive thing you're going to run into,
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:01.180]   which is, and this is like eBay use prices versus buy brand new prices, anywhere from
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:05.000]   177 to 440, and these are all prices as of this week.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.060]   And then to make the colloidal silver, you'll need some equipment, and that's basically
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:15.300]   nine-volt batteries, leads, volt, and TDS meter, and of course, pure silver wire, and
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:19.020]   that just as a straight package is about $82, I priced it out.
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:23.500]   So now, the cost to do the Bobback protocol could be anywhere from 397, all the way up
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.420]   to 972, depending on your equipment.
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:30.620]   So you could literally do this for less than 400 dollars, and the thing is, okay?
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.720]   It's a 400 dollar one-time investment, because you're just going to be able to use this over
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.140]   and over, if you've got a large family, then everybody can get treated, you don't have
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.460]   to keep going back to the drug store, stand in line, get your prescription, go on, you
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.900]   know, none of it, you don't have to keep going to the doctor, you have this thing and you
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.260]   use it, okay?
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.140]   And unless when your pieces of equipment break down, and you need to replace it, you're good
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.140]   to go.
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:55.460]   You can keep making colloidal silver, you can keep making ozone water, you can keep pulsing,
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.660]   you know, the batteries I'll have are all rechargeable, I never got to buy anything
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.660]   more.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.140]   It's a one-time investment, and you can use it over and over and over and over.
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:06.540]   Okay, in fact, the one that I'm using right now was the original one I bought eight years
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.860]   ago, and I bought other blood electrifiers, because I'm just a tinker and I want to try
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.300]   different products.
[00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:17.780]   But the original one that I started working with, I still use that one, and that thing's
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:22.780]   got rusted screws on it, it's just old and beat up, but it works, and it works great.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.020]   So that's the cost, okay?
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:28.780]   So now let's walk through the how-to, and I just want to first of all just kind of mention
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:34.220]   something where I'm using other individuals' videos of how to do these things because there
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:39.820]   is so many videos on how to make colloidal silver, how to do ozone water, how to make
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:40.820]   liposomalcy.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:45.380]   There's just so many of them that I just felt like it was completely unnecessary to kind
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.380]   of re-record yet another video doing the same thing.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:52.540]   So I'm just using other people's content, which I really try not to do, but I just want
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:57.380]   to just say, "Hey, sorry, this is how I'm doing it," because I think it's just pointless
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.140]   to make another video that somebody else has already made.
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:06.660]   And then secondly, I really, really, really wanted to get this out as fast as possible,
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.460]   and this was the fastest way to get this video out in the open.
[00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:13.620]   I think it's so critical given what's in the news right now, okay?
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.900]   So now how to make colloidal silver with 9-volt batteries.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.900]   If you've never done this before, it is very simple.
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.820]   It just sounds complicated, okay?
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.660]   Basically, these are the materials you need.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.300]   So you need a jar with the distilled water in it.
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.420]   You need two silver wires for the positive and negative electrodes, the two electrical
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.820]   leads that have alligator clips on both ends, four 9-volt batteries, a voltmeter to make
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.740]   sure you've got the right voltage and a TDS meter.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.020]   So now when you're doing this, and I'm just going to go ahead and kind of walk you through
[00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:48.260]   it, basically you take this guy, in fact, he's not using silver wires, using silver bars.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:52.660]   And so now you can use silver bars or silver coins, but you've got to make sure that they're
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.660]   pure silver.
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:29:00.100]   It's got to be 99.99, just absolutely must make sure that it is the purest form of silver.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.260]   Do not compromise.
[00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:05.580]   If there's any other metal in that, like, let's say you used a silver liberty versus
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:11.980]   a silver maple, well, the liberty's got some other, it's not pure, you know, 99.99% silver,
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:16.100]   but the silver maple, the Canada sells, you know, their one-ounce coins are.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.820]   But you know, or you can buy the wires, okay?
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.260]   You can buy pure silver wires, you can go on eBay, Amazon, so forth.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.180]   All right, so you've got to make sure it's pure silver.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.820]   So now you just have the jar, you put the water in it, and then this is what this individual
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:29.820]   does.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:35.700]   Using like this, basically, you know, plastic chip bag holder to hold the two alligator
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.820]   clips right there, and that's going to hold the wires that he puts into the jar with the
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:40.220]   distilled water.
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.220]   And then so that's really it.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:45.440]   You can see where he's using, instead of wires, using the bars.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.740]   So then he's got the silver clamped on with the alligator clips, and this is what he's
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.740]   using to hold it.
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.740]   No, I don't use that.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:56.780]   I just, you know, connect, I just have the wires hanging off the side of the jar.
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:01.300]   And then so the next thing he does, or that you would do, is you fill it up with distilled
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.300]   water.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.820]   You must use distilled water.
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.300]   There is no compromise on that.
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.020]   There must be nothing else in there, okay?
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:12.180]   And then of course, then you make sure that it's clean.
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.180]   It's clean distilled water.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.020]   You have a TDS meter meter, which measures the parts per million.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.500]   There should be zero.
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.820]   So you put your TDS meter in there, make sure it's zero.
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.820]   There's nothing else in there.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:26.740]   Now all you've got in there is silver, you know, and just water.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.740]   That's it.
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:28.740]   There's nothing else in there.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:29.740]   There's no salt.
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:30.740]   There's nothing else.
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:31.740]   Okay?
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.580]   And then you go ahead and just jump back up there.
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:38.620]   And then once you have the water in there, then you would then connect the four batteries.
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.100]   You connect them together, just like that, in series.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:48.580]   And if you take four times nine, you get 36 volts, then you connect it up to the wires
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.860]   like that.
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.980]   And this guy's kind of doing it a little clunky, but it's the idea is the same.
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.140]   And then you set your timer.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.380]   Well, he's setting a timer, but you don't need a timer.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:01.140]   You just kind of watch it and you keep measuring it with your TDS meter.
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:05.620]   Do you just keep watching it and measuring it with the TDS meter to see what your parts
[00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:06.620]   per million is?
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.620]   That's what a TDS meter is right there.
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.460]   So then I would just check it every 15 minutes.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:15.500]   And then when you see this thing go up to 10 parts per million, boom, you're done.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.180]   That is the Bobbeck protocol.
[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.620]   It's making Clodal or it's essentially ionic silver.
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.780]   I don't really want to get into this discussion between ionic and Clodal.
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.100]   I know what you're all thinking of those.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:30.140]   You guys understand that Bobbeck didn't worry about it and I'm not worrying about it.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.060]   So it, but it's essentially I got it.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.060]   Okay.
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.020]   But anyway, so you've basically that's it.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.140]   You've electrolyzed water with silver in it.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:42.180]   And now there's silver ions floating around in that water and it's being picked up by
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.540]   the TDS meter.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:47.140]   And once you get to 10 parts per million, 10 PPM, you're done.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.220]   That's what you need.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.060]   And that's what the Bobbeck protocol calls for.
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.060]   All right.
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.860]   So there's that.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.900]   So now this is ozone.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:59.980]   Now the ozone in order to make ozone water, okay, this is actually the model that I have.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:04.300]   I got like two of these, one in my kitchen and one is a backup and then I've also got
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.300]   my medical grade one.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.660]   But this is the one I use.
[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:07.660]   It works great.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:08.660]   It's just fine.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.300]   It's like, I don't know, 70 bucks or something.
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.220]   And so now what you need is an ozone generator.
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.460]   It comes with the tubing, the bubbler, you need a glass and you need water.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:19.140]   Now when making ozonated water, you don't need to have distilled water.
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.900]   Just any regular water will do and I recommend you always filter.
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.780]   So just have a glass of filtered water.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:28.420]   And then what you would do is you obviously take it out of the box and we get past that
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.420]   point.
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:30.420]   And there we go.
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:35.380]   And so you take it out of the box, you take your bubblers, they have this machine comes
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:40.420]   with two bubblers, one's for making ozonated oils and then once meant for water, the white
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:41.420]   ones for water.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.700]   So then you would basically set your machine.
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.500]   It has multiple settings on it.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.500]   And then I usually set it for 15 minutes at the highest that I can set it for.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:54.380]   And then you just take the bubbler, you connect the tube to the bottom, to the white one,
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.780]   and then plop that into a glass of water and just turn it on.
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.380]   And then it starts to bubble ozonated water.
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.380]   That's it.
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.820]   And then once it beeps and it's done the 15 minutes, there's your ozonated water.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:07.380]   It's as easy as that.
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:12.340]   This thing is so small that it does not create enough released ozone into the air to cause
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.940]   any concern.
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.620]   If you're in a large room, there's no worry about that.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.620]   You'll be fine.
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.100]   You will smell it, but it's not going to be harmful because it's not a lot of ozone.
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.860]   And that is how you make ozonated water.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:24.860]   Okay.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.340]   So now this is the how to do blood electrification.
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:32.620]   So in order to do blood electrification, you need to have a bloody electrifier, a little
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:37.100]   electronic device, and if you know, obviously there's links in the video description.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:41.420]   And I made a separate video all about blood electrification and went through all the different
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.460]   websites that sell it.
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.020]   So take a look at my video list.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.900]   You'll find it in there, but you need a blood electrifier.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.300]   That's the little device that Bob Beck invented.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.020]   Lots of different folks, not lots, but you know, there's about a half a dozen folks out
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.860]   there that are making these things for sale.
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:02.540]   soda is the actual real full on commercial, you know, producer of blood electrifiers.
[00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.220]   There's soda instruments in Canada.
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.820]   So you need one of those devices.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:10.300]   Now it comes with two electrodes, two cotton sleeves that cover the electrodes, two lead
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.300]   wires.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.980]   It comes with all this stuff, a wrist strap.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.260]   But what it doesn't come with is it doesn't come with a little dropper bottle.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.980]   And then you need to make a little bit of salt water.
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:23.140]   And the reason you need the salt water, and I'll show you this, is this is the actual gentleman.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:28.420]   I think his name is Ross and he actually was a partner of Bob's in terms of just parading
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:32.020]   around the country talking about blood electrification back in the day.
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:34.140]   He was a real young man at the time.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:36.300]   And so this is him describing his product now.
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:41.620]   He took Bob Beck's idea and made it commercial, so he's been doing this and selling this longer
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:42.940]   than anyone else has.
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:46.580]   And so, you know, kudos to you, you know, Ross for doing that.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.500]   And so now this is how he's basically describing how to use his product.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.340]   And then here's your cotton sleeves that he would put over the probes.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.180]   There's the probe right there.
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.380]   And then there's one on each side.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.820]   There's two, right?
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:00.580]   And then you have the two different probes, positive and negative.
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:03.020]   It plugs into your blood electrifier.
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.420]   You have a wristband right here.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:09.780]   And then so what you would do is, well that's the armband to hold the device, sorry.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.380]   So then you have the armband to hold the device on your upper arm and then you have a wristband
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.820]   right here that would hold the probes in place.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:20.180]   And so you can kind of see where he's showing right now the placement of the probes.
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.980]   There's two basic ways to do this, okay?
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.700]   We have two different arteries on both sides of our wrist.
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:31.980]   And so in the typical Bob Beck protocol, he originally would just basically put one on
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:36.100]   one artery and one on the other vein, like a vein artery, artery vein.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.700]   I'm sorry, I get confused.
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.340]   But there's one on each side, you can take a pulse off of each side of your wrist.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.740]   And that's just how our bodies are are meant.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:46.660]   So you can take a pulse on this side or a pulse on that side where the pulse, you feel
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.580]   the pulse, that's where you need to put the probe, okay?
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.420]   So you would put the probe right up over those two spots.
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:58.620]   So when you actually watch him do this, you basically, you need to set the probe spacing
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:03.640]   on the strap so that they go over the right places on your wrist.
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.620]   And that's how you have, that's probe placement right there, okay?
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:09.620]   So that's proper probe placement.
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:15.080]   And then the thing about the salt water now is in order to remain conductive, then you
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:20.420]   want to wet the cotton sleeves that go over the probes, you want to keep them moist and
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.460]   you need to use a conductive fluid which is simply salt added to water.
[00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:30.840]   And that will remain, it'll become conductive and it'll go from the probe through the cotton
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.080]   sleeve because it's been moistened with salt water because it needs to have some minerals
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:39.140]   into your skin right above where your vein and artery are.
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:45.780]   And because it's so close to your blood flow, that's how the electrical signal, the electrical,
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:50.940]   you know, pulsing voltage will actually pass through your bloodstream.
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:55.860]   Now one of the things, I'll get into the tips and things like that, but this is one way
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:56.860]   to do it.
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:00.540]   Now there's another way to do it where you literally could just do one side of you.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:06.420]   So on this side of your wrist, on the inside side is, for me, and for a lot of people,
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.660]   it's the only place they can find a pulse, for whatever reason, they just can't find
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.140]   a pulse on the outside of their wrist.
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:17.100]   And so if that's you, then you can use this one on this side and then on your other arm,
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.100]   you could use where you can find a pulse on your other.
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:21.660]   So you could do wrist to wrist or two per wrist.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:22.660]   Okay.
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.660]   There's different ways you could pulse.
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:27.500]   There's another way to use legs, but I have never seen anyone have any great success, except
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.180]   there's one character on YouTube, but I don't recommend trying to do legs because then you
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.980]   got wires going down and up and it's to be, that would be nuts.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:39.820]   But you can at least do either wrist to wrist right on the outside or on both sides of the
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:40.820]   wrist.
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:41.820]   Okay.
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.820]   And that's how you place it.
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.660]   And then when you turn that machine on, the key to it is you turn it up to where you can
[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.100]   feel the pulsing, and then you just turn it down.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.340]   I'll cover that in tips.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.180]   And that's how to use the blood electrifier.
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.180]   Okay.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:56.160]   Now, let's talk about the actual protocol itself.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.500]   This is straight out of the Bob Beck protocol.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.500]   The way you do it.
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.260]   Now you do it over a two hour span.
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.100]   This is when you build up to it, let me just back up.
[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:11.740]   This thing will work and it will cause a Herxheimer reaction.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:18.540]   Remember that detox thing, if you are heavily full of pathogens, okay, so it is highly
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:23.420]   recommended that you take baby steps to build yourself up to the full two hours.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:28.480]   So anyone who's never done this before should only try it for 15 minutes and see what happens.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.060]   And then do 30 minutes and see what happens and so forth.
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.300]   Don't all do it in the same day.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:33.300]   All right.
[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.980]   You just got to make sure that your body can handle the amount of detoxing that's going
[00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.060]   to occur once you turn this thing on.
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.060]   All right.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:41.780]   Make that very clear.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:46.500]   So now once you can build yourself up toward the two hours and I would suggest that you
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:51.860]   do that before you get sick, okay, you know, make sure you've got a tolerance for this
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.860]   thing.
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.940]   And that way when you get sick, you can run the full protocol.
[00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.300]   So now it's a two hour protocol.
[00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:59.940]   And the two hour protocol is where you would basically start.
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:04.620]   You would drink eight to 12 ounces depending on your size and it's all up to you of Clodal
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.620]   Silver.
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.900]   You drink it and you start zapping.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:12.580]   And then every half hour, okay, you drink another of the, yeah, you just kind of switch
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.580]   back and forth.
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:14.620]   So you can, and this is the thing.
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.980]   You can start with ozone and switch to Clodal Silver and you know, or you can start with
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.420]   Clodal Silver and switch to ozone.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:20.860]   It's not really specific.
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:25.700]   So I just put it out here like this, drink eight to 12 ounces of Clodal Silver and then
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.180]   start zapping, okay.
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:32.220]   And then half an hour later, drink again, another eight to 12 ounces of ozone water.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:39.060]   And then again, half hour, drink some Clodal Silver, eight to 12 ounces, half hour, drink
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:42.260]   ozone water, half hour, drink Clodal Silver, okay.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.260]   You get how that works.
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.260]   It's just every half hour.
[00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:45.260]   Just keep drinking.
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.260]   Okay.
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.260]   From start to finish.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.300]   And over two hours stand point of time.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:56.420]   Now one thing to know about that is that the actual forces of electroporation where it pops
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.940]   open your cells and you're able to suck in, you know, anything that's floating around
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:03.580]   that, you know, your permeability of your cell walls is greatly extended and you're
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.580]   able to absorb better anything that's floating around.
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:11.620]   Well, at this point, you've got a lot of Clodal Silver and ozone or radical oxygen is floating
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:16.420]   around in your bloodstream and the effect of electroporation will last for two more hours.
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:20.580]   So that's important to note so that during these two hours, it's basically a four hour
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.140]   time window that you should not take anything else.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:28.340]   I mean, I've eaten during this time period because, you know, and it didn't affect me.
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:32.820]   But I would just absolutely don't take anything else, okay, for those four hours because then
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.420]   you will get a mega dose of it.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:40.220]   I mean, Bob Beck has stories in his lectures where one person was doing blood of electrification,
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.940]   didn't pay any attention to the warnings.
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.540]   He had one beer and basically was on the floor, you know, because it was just his body had
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:51.540]   been electroporated and he just absorbed all that alcohol way more than he would normally
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.740]   have because his cells have paraded.
[00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:54.740]   Okay.
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.260]   So it does last for four hours.
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.260]   Okay.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:02.220]   Two hours during and the two hours afterwards, but the protocol itself is just for two hours.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.940]   You drink Clodal Silver, ozone, Clodal Silver, ozone, Clodal Silver and then you start zapping
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.660]   and stop zapping at the two hour mark.
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:12.340]   The protocol, this is the protocol and then you do it once daily for seven days.
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.340]   That's it.
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:19.700]   And then all of his human trials that Bob Beck had done showed that this will eliminate any
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:24.380]   pathogen in your bloodstream, viruses, bacteria, molds and fungus, anything that's alive other
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.900]   than you.
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.140]   You want you.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.140]   You don't want the rest of those guys.
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:29.140]   Okay.
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.340]   So that's the Bob Beck protocol and that's how you do it.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:35.000]   So now here are the tips and these are the points that I really want to get across to
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.220]   make sure everyone's really clear on what's important here.
[00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.620]   Sufficient mineralization and hydration is absolutely essential.
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.780]   If you are not hydrated and you don't have enough minerals in your body, then the current
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:50.260]   flow between the probes and through your blood will not occur because you just you don't
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:52.140]   have enough conductivity and it just won't work.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.620]   You need to be hydrated and you need to be mineralized.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.620]   Okay.
[00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:58.620]   The only thing is, is do not do this on a full stomach because why?
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.820]   Well, you're going to drink a lot of fluids and you're not going to be able to pee it
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:05.700]   out fast enough and don't do it late at night because otherwise you're going to be getting
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:06.820]   up a lot at night.
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:07.820]   This is all.
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:08.820]   Believe me.
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.820]   This is my experience.
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:10.820]   Okay.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.140]   So make sure you, you know, you can eat a little bit but don't eat too much because you're
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:16.940]   going to fill up with a lot of fluid and you need to drink all that fluid and that that's
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:17.940]   what takes precedent.
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:18.940]   That's why you're doing this.
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.380]   So just don't have a full stomach when you start.
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.380]   And the other thing too.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.940]   No, this is something new.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:27.700]   And I've kind of played around with it, Bob Beck said, do not take any medications because
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:32.300]   people were asking him, you know, well, what if I'm on, you know, I have to take my hypertensive
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.300]   medicine or whatever.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.540]   And then he would say, well, our test showed that you should not take it within 12 hours
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:38.900]   of doing blood electrification.
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.900]   Okay.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.300]   But so I have actually kind of just messed around with this to tink with it.
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:47.100]   And I've discovered that I actually can go and like within two hours, but I don't want
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:50.620]   to say that out, you know, as a recommendation, I would just say anywhere from six to 12
[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.620]   hours prior, do not take any medication.
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.620]   All right.
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:58.900]   Because again, you will have the transfection reaction and then you will have a bigger
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.300]   dose of the medication.
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:05.300]   So within six to 12 hours, you know, do not take any medication before you do the Bob
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.300]   Beck protocol.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.900]   And then this other thing that I think is really kind of important.
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:14.940]   The more I learn about C 60 antioxidants, radical oxygen, you know, scavengers, so forth,
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:19.060]   because you want ozone to work and you want those radical oxygens, you don't want anything
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:23.220]   up in else in your body that's going to be scavenging them up.
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:26.340]   You don't want anything mopping them up for right that moment, okay?
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:28.300]   So don't take any antioxidants.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:32.860]   Don't take your C 60 and then do your Bob Beck and then you could take it later.
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:37.220]   But you want you want those radical oxygens at the moment in time that you're doing the
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.380]   Bob Beck protocol.
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:44.300]   So do not take that stuff, okay, six to 12 hours prior to doing Bob Beck protocol.
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:48.140]   Now the eyedropper is to keep the sleeves moistened.
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.220]   Like I said, you should check every 15 minutes.
[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:52.620]   You will be amazed how fast those things dry out.
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:53.940]   You need to keep them moistened.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:57.740]   What's really you will notice right away that when they dry out and you put a drop in there
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:01.620]   and it moistens, boom, that pulse, you're going to feel that pulse 10 times stronger
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.620]   than it was before.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:07.660]   You don't realize how much that cotton sleeve being moist makes a difference to the strength
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:08.660]   of the pulse.
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.860]   So keep your probe sleeves moistened, okay?
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:15.300]   Now one of the things too, if you have metal probes, different machines have different
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:16.300]   types of probes.
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.960]   If you have metals, make sure you use a scrubby brush and you clean that thing thoroughly
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.620]   before you use those probes.
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.940]   Because anything that gets, that's between the probe and your bloodstream is going to
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:28.740]   interfere with the conductivity of the signal going through your bloodstream.
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:29.740]   Same thing with your skin.
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:34.420]   You need to wash your skin thoroughly before you place the probes on and you also need
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.220]   to keep your skin dry between the probes.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.220]   Now this is what's really important.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.540]   You saw that picture where he was holding up his wrist and the probes are on one side
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.540]   of his wrist.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.820]   Well, that space between the probes, you want to make sure when you're keeping your sleeves
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:51.860]   wet that you do not leave water or your skin cannot be wet there.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.540]   It needs to be as dry as a bone.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.460]   Because if you have any moisture between those probes then the current is going to go from
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:04.100]   one probe to the other probe across the top of your skin and you will not get the proper
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.140]   signal through your bloodstream, okay?
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:09.860]   So it needs to go into your body, not across your skin.
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.340]   So keep that area dry.
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:12.840]   Very, very, very important.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.140]   Now you need to maintain the power.
[00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:17.640]   Now when you have to turn up the dial, you put the probes on, get the sleeves wet, turn
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:21.260]   the electrifier on, turn the power up.
[00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.260]   Now you're going to be able to feel it.
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:25.820]   You'll turn it all up and then you'll feel this pulsing, right?
[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:29.900]   Then you want to turn it down to where you can just feel it, okay?
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:30.900]   Don't go too high.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.900]   Don't try to superman power struggle through it.
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:36.020]   Just go down to where you can barely just feel it and good enough.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.580]   That's good enough, okay?
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:40.060]   Because you may damage your skin, talked about that.
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:44.340]   Now again, one more time I got to say this is so critical, start slow.
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:48.300]   You ramp up in 15 minute increments until you reach two hours a day, okay?
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.300]   Be really careful.
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.860]   I have had herximer reactions doing different types of things.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.780]   They're not pleasant.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:46:00.900]   They manifest themselves in everything from flu-like symptoms to full-on rashes and illness and
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.220]   just, you know, it gets bad.
[00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:08.460]   So be really careful about detoxing too quickly because this thing will neutralize your pathogens
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.820]   and then your body will have to deal with it.
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:14.460]   And you don't want to overwhelm your body's ability to do so.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.460]   Okay.
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:21.500]   Now, for the, how to use the magnetic pulser, the magnetic pulser is just a paddle connected
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.500]   to a little box.
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.460]   And so really that's all you need.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:28.140]   And then what you need to do, and this is the thing about, depending on what virus you're
[00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:32.700]   treating, you know, who knows whether or not it acts like the HIV virus and goes and hides
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.020]   out in your lymphatic system.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:37.980]   I'm just covering this part because I want to be thorough because this is quote the official
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.220]   Bob Beck protocol.
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:42.580]   And I don't want to make a video that follows it to the letter.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:46.300]   So now these are the points on your body that Bob Beck said you needed to zap.
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.340]   And so then right here under your armpits, right here in your groin area and then right
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:52.300]   here behind your ears.
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.300]   Okay.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:54.300]   So there's six points on your body.
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:58.740]   You would take the paddle and with the north side of the paddle, always north.
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.740]   Okay.
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:04.020]   And you use the north side facing your skin, you zap for three minutes in each location
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.300]   and you do three times each.
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:10.100]   So you hit these, you just go, you know, go full circle three times, three minutes each.
[00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:14.340]   And that's how you do the magnetic pulsing as part of the Bob Beck protocol.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.340]   All right.
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:20.020]   Now, the last thing I wanted to do is just kind of talk about the liposomal vitamin C.
[00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:22.060]   And this, this would wrap up the how to.
[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:27.360]   The liposomal vitamin C as an as a substitution for a clodal silver.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.360]   Like I said, it works.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.360]   Okay.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:32.900]   So now if you wanted to do that, it's, it's $70 for all the stuff you would need.
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:34.940]   And it's very, very simple to do.
[00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:38.500]   So all you need is an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner like this.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:42.460]   You need some asorbic acid, some sunflower lethicin and distilled water.
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:44.300]   This one, you need distilled water.
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.300]   Okay.
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.900]   I know it gets complicated, right?
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.380]   But this is what you need to do.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:50.380]   And the recipe is quite simple.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.380]   This is my recipe.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.900]   She's done it differently.
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:56.980]   My recipe and this video actually does it differently than my recipe, but it's just there
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:57.980]   for show.
[00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:58.980]   I'll walk you through it.
[00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:03.980]   But it's three tablespoons of lethicin with eight ounces of water and I use hot water.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:07.780]   And then one, it helps, you know, basically dissolve everything much easier.
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.500]   And then one tablespoon of a sorbic acid for ounces of water.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:14.940]   So what I do is I basically take these two, I, I make them separately, each one in its
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:18.420]   own glass, dissolve the lethicin, dissolve the sorbic acid.
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:22.620]   And then I pour it into the ultrasonic cleaner and I son of Kate for six minutes.
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:23.620]   That's it.
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:27.420]   And then you've got liposomal vitamin C, which is exactly like lipofluorines.
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:31.420]   Basically you're creating a, you're using a fat, which is a lipid.
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:35.020]   And you're, you're basically surrounding a another molecule.
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:39.780]   In this case, it's a sorbic acid molecule for C60, it's the, it's the C60 molecule.
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:46.860]   So when you're doing liposomal C60, then you're creating liposomes out of C60, which is called
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.260]   lipofluorines.
[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.420]   And then if you do it with vitamin C, you get liposomal vitamin C. Same concept, the
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:54.940]   exact same concept using sonication as opposed to stirring.
[00:48:54.940 --> 00:49:00.300]   So now here's this guy's video basically walks through the different, you know, different
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.580]   tools that you need and the different materials.
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:05.860]   He actually, which is really cool about this video, all the links here in the video description.
[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.380]   He actually uses a microscope to show you the liposomes when he's done.
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:13.500]   So basically he does it where using, he's using a cooling, a cooler water and he lets
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:17.380]   it sit for a while, it's faster and his, his measurements are a little different.
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:20.620]   But bottom line is he mixes it all together.
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:23.900]   And he just has a different mixing, you know, way he does it.
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:27.500]   But bottom line is you put it all in the ultrasonic cleaner.
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:31.500]   And then he, then when he's done with the ultrasonic cleaner, then he then mixes it up
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.340]   with a blender, which I think is excessive, you don't need that step.
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:35.340]   And then he does a check.
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:38.940]   And when he does the check, it's kind of cool, where you can actually see right there, you
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:41.380]   can see the liposomes have formed.
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:45.060]   So that just kind of shows that, hey, it worked, you know, and I made liposomal vitamin C.
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:49.140]   This would also probably work, I guess, I don't know, I don't want to go into a C60.
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.660]   So, but that's, that's kind of it for that.
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:55.220]   So you can definitely, like I said, substitute this for the Clodal Sover, all right?
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.180]   So that's that, that's the video.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:02.820]   Now for anyone who wants to know more, learn more, this, you can keep going on with me.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:04.900]   But you know, it's already gotten to 50 minutes at this point.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.500]   I wanted to keep it as short as possible.
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.540]   But that is the Bob Beck protocol.
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.060]   It works.
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:14.660]   It works really well for me.
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:20.460]   And I just encourage everyone to not just focus on everything that I'm seeing in the
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:24.060]   news about, you know, how to avoid it and how to avoid this and how to avoid that.
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.060]   But you know, you need to kind of plan for like, well, what would happen if you did catch
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:31.340]   it, you know, and if you're reading the news, you know that if you did catch it, you're
[00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:36.780]   going to be very, very hard pressed to get any attention from medical authorities because
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:40.780]   of just the onslaught of all the other people that need medical attention as well.
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:45.500]   So to be able to self-treat at home is critical in these times.
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:49.860]   And I just highly encourage everybody to do whatever you can to make sure that you and
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:52.700]   your loved ones are going to be able to write out any storms.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:53.700]   Okay.
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:58.220]   Now let me walk you through one other thing before I let you go and get into the research.
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:02.700]   This is the, this is all of the links in the video description.
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.740]   And I just want to show you that I did all this research and there's a ton more information
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.980]   than what I've just discussed with you.
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:10.680]   So here's going to be the links.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:14.260]   It's going to be all the different equipment for blood electrification equipment.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:17.140]   The research, all the videos I've showed you, the patents, everything.
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:20.780]   And if you click on any one of these links that'll show you the actual research behind
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:25.100]   blood electrification and Bob Beck and his book and all that, Clodal Silver, same thing.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:30.420]   Here the supplies for Clodal Silver, the research behind Clodal Silver, ozone, the supplies,
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:33.460]   the research, pulse-electromagnetic field therapy.
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.140]   Here's the Pulsar, the research.
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:39.360]   Clodal liposomal vitamin C, again, the supplies and the research and then some information
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:40.580]   about the Herxheimer reaction.
[00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:41.580]   Okay.
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:46.660]   So, oh, there's a ton of links, a ton of research in the video description so that you
[00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.620]   can go ahead and do what you need to do.
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:49.620]   All right.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:50.620]   Well, that's it.
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:51.860]   So, you know, thank you so much for watching the video.
[00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:57.060]   Now the rest of this video will be basically the research material, the validation and
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:58.420]   the science behind some of this stuff.
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:01.300]   And it's, I find it quite interesting for those of you who want to stick around, come
[00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:05.460]   with me, probably be another 10 minutes and then we'll wrap this whole thing up, okay?
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.620]   So for the rest of you, Aloha, thank you very much.
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.140]   I really appreciate your time.
[00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.540]   So, now let's get into the research material.
[00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:17.340]   Now, I basically wanted to just validate how these, each one of these separate components
[00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:24.220]   work using a direct testimony from different doctors, different institutes and so forth,
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:29.180]   so that you can see that these are valid academic and they're not just, you know, you know,
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.180]   crazy woo guys in the interlands, okay.
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:37.700]   So now I did show you the patent for blood electrification and that is a proven methodology
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:41.740]   for nullifying viruses, pathogens and so forth.
[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:45.380]   Now let's, let's just, I just want to play a little bit of this video so that you can
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:50.180]   kind of hear how ionic silver works and why it works, okay?
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.340]   So let me go ahead and start this and then I just want you to hear it.
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.340]   What is it about silver?
[00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:59.700]   I'm seeing silver coins kill bacteria even in a water jug.
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:07.620]   I'm seeing silver in many different forms destroy stink and odor, viruses, bacteria.
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.380]   What is it about silver and why does it work?
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:14.980]   I'm Dr. Gordon Pedersen and I'm the medical director of the Silver Health Institute and
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:18.500]   this is why silver works.
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:23.280]   In a chemical diagram, this is what silver looks like.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:31.820]   We have two electrons in an interorbital, 8, 18 and then in the outer orbital we only
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:35.160]   have one electron, I've signified it right there.
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:38.780]   This is significant and this is why silver works.
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:46.480]   It has only one electron here and it rotates like a wheel that's out of balance.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:55.000]   It can't ever get itself even as dense as it is in balance until an electron is placed
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.120]   into this placement.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.260]   Where is it going to get an electron?
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:01.220]   One single electron?
[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:03.520]   It's going to steal it from bacteria.
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:05.460]   It's going to steal it from viruses.
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.340]   It's going to steal it from yeast.
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:14.780]   Yeah, here's a single layered cellular organism meaning there's only all these little teeny
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:19.640]   electrons around here and that makes up a cellular wall.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:25.020]   It is an incomplete cellular wall because it's only one electron thick.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:32.580]   As soon as this silver particle which is magnetic gets anywhere near this bacteria, it's going
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:38.260]   to steal that bacteria and make silver completely in balance.
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:43.500]   Stealing an electron from bacteria, viruses and yeast balances silver.
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.060]   That's why silver works.
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:52.340]   There's other mechanisms of action but silver steals an electron to balance itself out thus
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:57.700]   destroying pathogens.
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:00.580]   And they said that there's no treatment for viruses.
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.500]   Now, let's talk about ozone therapy.
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:06.260]   Again, here's the courtesy of the American Center for Biological Medicine.
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:09.580]   I think this is a profound video that you should listen to as well.
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:15.580]   One is blood ozone therapy which is actually IV ozone and the other one is rectal ozone
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:16.580]   therapy.
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:18.620]   What ozone does is exactly what it sounds like it does.
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:24.580]   It oxygenates the blood but it's also a wonderful way to get your immune system stimulated
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:25.820]   and to fight infections off.
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:30.180]   So whether you have a long-standing infection or chronic fatigue or you're going on a trip
[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:34.660]   and you don't want to get infections, doing a form of ozone is one of the best ways you
[00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:39.180]   can to stimulate your immune system and kill off pathogens.
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:43.020]   To draw the blood out, the inject ozone into your blood and then it goes back into the
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:44.020]   system.
[00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:45.020]   It's very safe.
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:46.020]   It's very hygienic.
[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:49.220]   And what the ozone does is it stimulates your cells to produce some things that fight
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:54.980]   infection and then of course the ozone itself has a wonderful ability to sterilize any viral
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:59.620]   or we'll say pathogenic infections in the bloodstream and that also gets into the tissues.
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:03.580]   Ozone therapy in whatever form we deliver it, whether it's for me.
[00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:04.580]   Just stop it right there.
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:11.780]   If you heard him again, you can hear why did Bob Beck choose Clodosilver, why did Bob
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:17.980]   Beck choose ozone and in both of these situations there's a reputable doctor basically explaining
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:22.020]   to you very clearly that these things will kill pathogens.
[00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:26.820]   So he put that in the combination of blood electrification for obvious reasons.
[00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:27.820]   And surprise, surprise.
[00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:32.620]   Here's another way to kill viruses that you don't hear about from the mainstream media.
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:39.180]   Okay so now how does pulse-electro-magnetic field therapy work and this is courtesy of
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:41.620]   Dr. Steven Stokes.
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:47.180]   The technology is called Pulse-electro-magnetic field therapy or PMF for short.
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:49.860]   What it does is nothing short of remarkable.
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:55.620]   Using a high amount of voltage in the tens of thousands, it creates a man-made lightning
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:57:03.140]   bolt that is then projected through a wire system to create a strong magnetic field that
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:05.260]   is intense but brief.
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:11.100]   So brief that the magnetic field safely slips through the cellular membranes to activate
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:17.580]   and charge the cell's DNA, the very essence of the repair mechanism of that cell.
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:23.420]   Studies show that pulse-electro-magnetic field therapy assists stem cells in your own body
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.700]   to differentiate into the damaged tissue.
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:29.980]   So the healing potential for this treatment is limitless.
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:35.500]   The FDA in the United States has already approved PMF therapy for bone regeneration.
[00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:42.020]   And as mentioned before, there are over 600 studies online at the pubmed.gov website that
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:46.540]   show its validity in treating everything from Alzheimer's, back pain, digestive problems,
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.100]   anxiety, and yes, even cancer.
[00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:53.900]   PMF therapy is changing medicine at a quick alarming rate.
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:55.380]   Paul.
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:58:02.260]   So I just want to point out there, it's treating, quote, cancer and the whole issue about pulse-electro-magnetic
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:07.820]   field therapy is, you know, he doesn't mention electroporation but that's obviously one of
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:09.740]   the other effects from it.
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:15.700]   But the aspect of not only electroporation but it also, like he was mentioning, it stimulates
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:19.260]   the ATP production in the cells which induces healing.
[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:24.780]   And so if you've got damage being created by viruses, pathogens and so forth, not only
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:30.700]   does PMF, you know, kind of basically stun the viruses, it'll also kick your cells into
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:37.940]   a repair mode just like ozone is a immune modulator that'll kick in your immune system.
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:42.740]   So this was the fourth protocol that was added to make, you know, the fourth step to make
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:44.260]   the bot-back protocol.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:50.460]   So the last one is I wanted to just kind of introduce you to Dr. Andrew Saul, he's got
[00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:52.300]   a PhD.
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:57.620]   And if you've never heard of Andrew Saul, I can't, you know, this is just a lecture.
[00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:01.320]   There's no, you know, really good sound bite that I could grab from this lecture but I
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.260]   did put this in the video description.
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:05.900]   And what I want to point out, and this is probably one of the most important things I
[00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:16.060]   could ever share with you is that Dr. Andrew Saul is the, he's the individual behind the
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:19.540]   website called DrYourself.com, okay?
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:25.340]   And so if you will see, he's got a page and what DrYourself.com is, it's basically an
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:33.060]   encyclopedia of how to treat numerous different ailments, diseases and problems using nutrients.
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:38.940]   Okay, and so he's created this encyclopedia of studies, of knowledge, of protocols and
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:43.420]   just a huge base of information that I literally have used as my Bible for my own personal
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:44.420]   health.
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:48.020]   And so I think one of the most important things that, that you could see right on, this is
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:51.700]   the SARS-Pays Coronavirus SARS page.
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:57.380]   This is obviously in the video description and how to treat it with vitamin C. Then here's
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.700]   a quote that I just want to just share with you.
[00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:04.980]   And it's a quote by Robert F. Cathhart MD, "I've not seen any flu yet that was not cured
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:10.460]   or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C. And then he goes on to have all
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:15.500]   these different links to different places in his encyclopedia called DrYourself.com where
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:22.140]   he talks about how vitamin C is incredibly powerful tool against any type of virus to
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:23.140]   wipe it out.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:28.900]   So you can see why for myself and my recommendation that it is a equitable substitute for collateral
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:33.620]   silver vitamin C, especially liposomal vitamin C. And just for those of you who are not familiar
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:37.980]   with liposomal vitamin C versus vitamin C, I just want to point out that vitamin C is
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:43.820]   water soluble, which means when you take vitamin C as a capsule or a tablet, the efficacy
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:47.460]   rate or your ability to absorb the vitamin C is about 19% of it.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.540]   And the other 81% of that vitamin C will just eliminate through your urinary tract.
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:54.580]   Okay, because it just, it just, you know, it's water soluble.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:58.220]   And so you don't really absorb much and you have to take a lot because you're only, you're
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:01.860]   only absorbing, you know, 19% of whatever you take in.
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:08.200]   Now when you create liposomal vitamin C, that, that 19% goes all the way up to about 92%.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:14.420]   So it really makes it that much more bio available, like four to five times more bio available.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:19.100]   And so that when you take vitamin C as in a liposomal form, which is exactly the same
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:25.060]   concept of taking vitamin, I'm sorry, C 60 in a liposomal form, it becomes bio available.
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:29.500]   And that's why, you know, it, that's why I, you know, I'm, I'm basically recommending
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.980]   that you take it as a liposomal and not just as a vitamin C. Okay.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:37.940]   But in a pinch, you, if you were taking vitamin C, Dr. Andrew Saul, I think there's a one
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:41.620]   of his articles I read on there that basically said, well, if you're going to just take tablets
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:45.940]   and just take one of these, take a thousand milligrams every six minutes or 10 minutes
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:50.260]   or something like that, until you have loose stool, so which you can take thousands and
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:53.700]   thousands and thousands before you get there, because you're only, you know, 19%.
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:57.420]   But if you take liposomal vitamin C and you take like four ounces and four ounces and four
[01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:01.860]   ounces and you're drinking it and by the way, two caveats about it.
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:04.020]   One, it tastes really horrible.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.220]   So that's just something you have to overcome.
[01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:12.700]   Number two is if you do this and you're doing blood electrification, I will remind you again
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:15.060]   that there's that thing called transfection.
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:21.860]   When you take in a lot of liposomal vitamin C and you do blood electrification simultaneously,
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:27.980]   you will reach maximum saturation way quicker than you normally would.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:32.220]   So if you've done a vitamin C flush before and you know what to expect, this is not like
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.220]   that.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:39.060]   You will reach it so quickly that you'll be very surprised and you need and I'm not trying
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:43.060]   to be humorous, but you need, if you're going to do this, if you're going to take liposomal
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:51.620]   vitamin C and do blood electrification, very serious warning, you need to be very close
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:54.020]   to a toilet the entire time.
[01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:56.780]   Do not go and leave the house.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.140]   This is personal experience.
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:04.100]   You will need those toilet trips and you will not have a choice whether to use the toilet.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.980]   So you better have one around, okay?
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:09.060]   So that's, that's, you know, because it's a vitamin C flush and you're going to be saturated
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:12.380]   because the worst thing that could ever happen with too much vitamin C is you have loose
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.860]   stools or you have diarrhea, okay?
[01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:16.100]   That's the ultimate place where this all goes.
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:22.740]   So heads up on that vitamin C is powerful, doctoryourself.com.
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:25.580]   This one of the best sites on the internet for staying healthy.
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.580]   All right.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:29.460]   So lastly, that's it.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.100]   That's the last slide.
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:33.900]   Thank you so much for your time today.
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.940]   It's an hour of your time and it's, it's so valuable.

[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:48.500]   And if you have any questions at all, come on to the Tinkers Academy, go on to the Telegram
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.700]   chat group and just, you know, ask questions.
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:53.860]   I'm always available on either one of those platforms.
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:58.660]   And I just want to say thank you and, and, you know, we are facing some uncertain times
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:02.660]   ahead of us with what's going on with China.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:06.140]   And this is, this is one way to bring some peace of mind.
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:08.460]   And personally, I'm not, I'm not even worried about it.
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:09.460]   I'm prepared for this.
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:11.900]   I've done it so many times I can't even count.
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:16.180]   I've had some serious, serious illnesses that I've treated with a Bob Beck protocol and
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:21.020]   come back from, you know, you know, near death pretty much.
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:22.940]   And so I'm, I'm not worried at all.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:25.300]   I'm ready for this and I know what to do.
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:30.300]   And I, I, I hastily put this video together so you would also know what to do.
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:33.180]   And, and I hope that, I hope that it, nothing happens to you.
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:37.380]   I hope that you have good health and, and take care of yourselves.
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.860]   And if you've got any questions, you know, where to find me?
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.800]   Hey, thank you so much again.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:42.640]   Have a great weekend.
