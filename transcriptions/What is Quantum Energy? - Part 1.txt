[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host, Kay Elmer. And in
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:11.120]   this video, I'd like to share with you my theory on what is quantum energy. Now, if this is going
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.880]   to be part one of a two part series, part two is going to be how does it work? Now, just some
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.320]   disclosures before we start getting into it, this video covers my theoretical interpretation
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.040]   on what quantum energy is as defined by Leila quantum tech and how it works. So that's really
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.840]   important. We're going to be really focusing on what we have learned over the last three years
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.200]   of Leila quantum tech and all of the different studies that they've done and take those results
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.880]   and then try to fold that into a working theory on really what is quantum energy and how does it
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.400]   work? Now, this theory is based on observation and a simplistic common sense approach towards
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.520]   understanding the nature of our universe. All content provided is done so through fair use.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.120]   And I wanted to say we learn something new every day. So I reserve the right to change my mind
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.720]   as time goes forward. So first things first, let's level set. And what I mean by that, for anyone
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.440]   who's not familiar with what Leila quantum tech does, they make products that they claim are infused
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.160]   with quantum energy. And that when you use these devices or not necessarily use them, let's say
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:27.840]   you expose yourself, people, plants or animals, or you expose substances to the quantum energy
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.040]   that is contained in their devices and or they have a at distance service that projects the energy
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.640]   as well, then certain things are going to happen. Now, there's been over 60 studies that have been
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.400]   done over the last three years. And these are all NIH level studies. And what I mean by that
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.000]   is that they have been commissioning third party, independent researchers, different scientists
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.440]   and different professors and different institutions in Europe and in the United States to evaluate
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.040]   the claims that they're making as to their products and what it does, what the results will be when
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.160]   you're exposed to them. And the studies are literally following the gold standard of scientific study.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.360]   They are using basically, you know, sham devices. They're negating the observer effect by, you know,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.840]   the clinicians don't know when they're using an actual real device that's charged and when that's
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.320]   not. They're also doing it in double blind, where the actual participants, when they used humans,
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.520]   that the humans themselves didn't know when something was actually a real device versus a
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.240]   effective, I say they call it a sham study. So these double blind independent third party
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.480]   sham studies have been being conducted for the last three years. There's over 60 of them.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.920]   There are still more studies that are being done now. Today, this is May 2024. So, you know,
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.480]   the research continues, but there's been enough evidence now for basically us. And when I say us,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.240]   I mean, you know, the people that study this, you know, I'm not a employee of Leyla quantum tech.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.880]   So when I say us, I mean, the humanity, okay, you know, we're learning from this company who's
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.560]   paying for all these studies. And so what we're learning, what we are learning is that when you
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.600]   expose people, plants and animals, what the results are showing in these gold standard and
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:29.200]   double blind NIH level studies, okay, is that it improves the bio energetic markers of the
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.040]   individuals against 60 various meridian points along their body, all tied to different organs.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.960]   And in other words, the bio energetics is the ability to, you know, to evaluate and measure
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.400]   whether there's stress on the body and when and or, you know, obviously when the stress is
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.080]   relieved, it improves heart rate variability. It improves white cell count. Okay, so white
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.800]   blood cell count, it increases that when exposed to this energy, your body produces more white
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.120]   blood cells. That's what the studies show. It improves oxygenation. It improves ATP production,
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.160]   which is a the powerhouse microchondra in your cells produce energy that your entire body runs
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.120]   off of. If you didn't have ATP, you wouldn't, you wouldn't exist. You would just fall down dead.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.520]   So it literally is the energy by which our bodies function and it causes this energy causes
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:31.680]   our mitochondria to produce more ATP. Now it also decreases blood clotting. And it also expedites
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.760]   wound healing. It actually has been proven in multiple double blind studies that it actually
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:45.680]   causes the cells to repair themselves faster by up to 100% faster. So twice as fast wound healing
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.480]   when exposed to quantum energy. And that's the exposure to biological living organisms, right?
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.800]   Now it also has also been tested on substances, which is one of the more remarkable studies that
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.120]   have been done. There's one going on right now. There was a prior one. And what they're showing
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.760]   and what these chemists are doing, there's a chemist right now doing studies in Europe. And
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.960]   they've determined that it alters the redox potential of a substance. And what that means,
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.720]   and specifically the substance that they're focusing on right now, is zinc. You know,
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.320]   the mineral that we all take and the world needs, your body needs it. And so when they take zinc
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.120]   and they run it through every single possible laboratory instrument that they have, and it
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.680]   registers as zinc. And so then they expose it to these devices, these quantum energy devices,
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.280]   and they run it through all these different laboratory tests again. It still shows as zinc,
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.760]   but it's changed. And it's changed in the redox potential, which is the electron. I won't get into
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:55.360]   it, but that's the thing. It actually changes substances at a quantum level, at the atomic level.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.840]   And they're now able to actually measure the changes in substances using the redox potential
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.120]   evaluation. So with all of that said, that's the level set. That's what this incredible thing is
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:14.080]   doing that later the quantum tech is, you know, is manufacturing and selling on the market. They've
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.760]   got the studies that really back up all of their claims. So when you're trying to understand,
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.440]   okay, well, you know, that sounds really cool, right? But, you know, like, what is it? I mean,
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:30.960]   what is this energy? So let's take a look at classical physics in, you know, according to modern
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.520]   day as to like, Hey, you know, what? Okay, so what is this energy? You know, because, you know,
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.720]   if you were to listen to any of the interviews done by the founder of Leila Quantum Tech, his
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.960]   name is Phillip von Holzendorf. He always refers to it as pure quantum energy. And they've adopted
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.840]   in and he's adopted the word quantum. So if you say the word quantum, then you're talking about
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.440]   particle physics, okay? And so the first thing that you would think if you are familiar with physics
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.880]   is, you know, the idea of quantum field theory, you know, if you're going to use the word quantum,
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.400]   that means subatomic, right? So then that means quantum field theory. And so what that is in physics,
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.400]   it's a theoretical framework in physics that combines quantum mechanics, special relativity,
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.320]   relativity, and classical field theory. So what are those three things? Well, quantum mechanics
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.320]   is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy on an atomic
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.120]   and subatomic scale. That's what I just described. And then what is special relativity? Well,
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.720]   special relativity is the famous formula developed by Albert Einstein to kind of describe the
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.280]   behavior of spacetime and motion at high speeds approaching the speed of light.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.160]   So if you're familiar with this equals mc squared, you've probably seen that your whole life all
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:53.040]   all over the place, right? Is that energy, according to Einstein, equals mc. So m stands for mass. So
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:59.280]   anything that has mass, whether it's an atom or a locomotive. Okay, so if it and then it's multiplied
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:07.600]   by c, which is a c stands for constant. And in this formula, constant is the speed of light squared.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:14.800]   So in other words, it's energy is mass, something that has mass moving really, really, really fast.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:20.720]   Okay, you know, and so, and so that is what Einstein came up with as, hey, what is, you know,
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.280]   what is the special relativity? He tried to describe spacetime, you know, reality, right?
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.840]   And he said, hey, it's energy is mass moving really fast. And then you've got classical
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.800]   theory theory. And again, all of this is part of quantum field theory. So classical field theory
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:40.720]   is a theoretical framework in physics that describes the behavior of classical fields
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.560]   and their interactions. So what I've tried to do is like, okay, you know, according to Leila Q,
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:55.040]   you know, this, this energy exists all around us and their devices are able to hold a higher level
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.720]   than the normal, quote, ambient energy around you. And instead, these things are like amped up and
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.360]   they're charged is the phrase that's used. And that when when they're charged, because they're
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.200]   so much stronger than the ambient energy around you, that they can do all these incredible things.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.240]   And so that's some of the part where you would think, okay, well, if that's true, then, but here's
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:20.640]   the deal. There's no particles, there's not like it's not like electricity, there's you don't touch
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:26.080]   it, you just near it. So there's nothing that's coming. In other words, there's nothing moving
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.960]   from this thing to you or your pet's plants. Okay, so it's not moving. But in classical
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:37.440]   theory theory, there are forces that are maybe what, you know, Philip is describing, which is,
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.800]   but when you look at when you look at the physics, okay, classical physics, when you look at classical
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.960]   field theory now, the four forces that comprise classical field theory are gravitational,
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.800]   electromagnetic, strong nuclear force, which is the force of the, you know, basically positive
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.520]   attractive to negative, you know, the electrons being attracted to protons. And that's what holds
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.240]   the atoms together. And then the weak nuclear force is what holds the protons to the neutrons
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:10.720]   in the center of the atom. And so these four fundamental forces, again, are particle base. So
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:16.480]   what is quantum energy? Well, if there's no particles, then it doesn't fit. And that's the
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.680]   point here I'm making is it just doesn't fit into modern physics or classical physics
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:29.120]   understanding of energy. However, there's a non mass form of energy that's accepted in quantum
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:35.040]   physics. And that is something that doesn't have mass moving fast. Okay. And that's like your
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:40.640]   electromagnetic radiation heat, potential energy. That's like, you know, energy stored in a spring
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.640]   when you compress it. It's got all this energy so that when you release the, you know, whatever's
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:49.120]   holding it, it springs back. And that's called potential energy, of course, sound waves and
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.440]   electric and magnetic fields. So that explains like, Oh, hey, there's, you know, they, you know,
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.960]   of course, physics has to recognize that, Hey, there is a form of energy. It's not a force.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:07.360]   It's an energy that that can permeate right from one place to another, but that doesn't have any
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.000]   particles involved. However, if you look at the list, you don't see anything says quantum. If you
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.720]   actually look up quantum energy, according to classical physics, it'll talk about particles,
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.280]   you know, how the particles, the theory of how particles interact with each other. And when I
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.480]   say particles, I mean atomic and subatomic particles. So, you know, classical, you know,
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:32.240]   chemistry or physics right here, you know, these are, this is what a typical diagram of an atom
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.320]   looks like you've got electrons circling around protons and neutrons as the center of the atom.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.680]   And so when you look at physics and specifically quantum physics, it's the study of the atom and
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:50.640]   everything that comprises an atom. And even what comprises the particles that comprise the atoms
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.000]   themselves, right? So right here, the list is pretty short. So there is, and this is my point,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.240]   there is nothing in classical physics, modern day physics, that explains what's happening
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:09.360]   within the definition of Leila quantum text, use of the term quantum energy, thus I'm making the
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:15.360]   video. However, I do want to give them credit. And this is the modern day physics, physicists,
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:22.080]   and classical physicists, that they're actually did back in the late 1800s. There was an attempt,
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:27.600]   right, to recognize that for, you know, for thousands of years, you know, there's all these
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.640]   different cultures that have recognized that there's this thing, there's this energy all around us.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:39.520]   And you know, like the Asians call it qi or qi, you've got the, you know, the Indians call it prana,
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.720]   you've got, you know, Hawaiians out there, I'm from Hawaii, and they call it mana. And there's
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.200]   all this, you know, basically, it's energy that, you know, that, that surrounds all of us. And
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.640]   there's all these different words for it. And so, so back then, they recognized that there was
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.760]   something. And the actual original person who created the first periodic table of elements
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:08.320]   in 1869 was a guy by the physicist by the name of Dimitri Ivanovich Mendeleev. Okay. And he theorized
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.800]   by when he first put together the very first periodic table of elements that, you know, became
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:19.920]   the mainstay of science. He included in the group of noble gases, this comp, this concept or this
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.520]   element that he called aether. And it's now also called ether, but ether gets confused with the
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.080]   chemical ether. So, you know, aether ether either one. But the whole idea, though, is that that he
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:35.360]   basically said, hey, the concept of aether was used in several theories to explain several
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.440]   natural phenomenon that they couldn't explain. So they kind of said, well, we can't explain it.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:45.520]   So let's give it a name. We'll call it aether. And this, this aether would be the thing, the
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:51.600]   element that would, that would allow the propagation of light and gravity in the late 19th century,
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.640]   physicists postulated that aether permeated space, providing a medium through which light could
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.840]   travel in a vacuum, but evidence for the presence of such a medium was not found in this famous
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:08.800]   experiment that was done in 1887 by Michelson and Morley, and because they could not validate that
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:16.880]   this quote aether existed, then it was taken off the periodic table of elements. So again, you know,
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.840]   they did try the and they actually had it on the periodic table of elements, ether, but they took
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:27.920]   it off because they couldn't prove it, but they couldn't prove it 164 years ago. So can you imagine
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.720]   what these guys would be able to do if you gave them some Leila quantum tech blocks,
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.120]   signed them up for the upgrade service and let them have at it? I think they would come up with
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:42.640]   way different results because now there's a lot of studies that prove a it exists and b it does
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.280]   something. And of course, we're here trying to figure out what is it exactly. So that
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:54.160]   brings us to where I think that the best way to understand what is quantum energy is to understand
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.240]   the nature of the universe. In other words, what's the context by which you're trying to define
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.520]   something? So the very first thing, and I've kind of come down my theory is that there's three models,
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:08.000]   you know, there's three models that represent the nature of the universe right now, if you were to
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.040]   review what modern science is offering us, right? And the first one again, as I just went through
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:19.360]   is particle based, you know, the universe is comprised of particles, everything's particles
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.920]   and everything I just explained to you all defines exactly how they think and what they think about
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:30.080]   the fact that at the quantum level of existence, it's all particles, all atomic and subatomic
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.880]   particles, and all of that stuff combined creates what we see everywhere around us and including
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:41.680]   ourselves. And so that's one model of, you know, of context and a model of understanding how,
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.280]   you know, what is quantum energy? And I want to just kind of say that, you know, I've kind of got
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:52.560]   two more. Let's talk about that. So here comes another theory that was postulated back in the 1870s,
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:58.320]   all the way through 1890, by a gentleman called William Thompson, who also became better known,
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:03.840]   better known as Lord Kelvin. And so basically, he was the first one that says, you know,
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:09.760]   this is why Mendeleev was creating the, you know, the theory of, you know, of ether. And of course,
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.960]   it was later disproved. But all during this time, the late 1800s, there was all these different
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.360]   physicists trying to understand the world, right, understand the universe. And he, and so what
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:26.080]   Lord Kelvin did was he came up with this theory, and he conjectured that atoms might be vortices
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:33.680]   in the ether that pervades space. And so why that's so important is it means that, you know,
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:41.360]   below the, you know, the atomic level below the level of, okay, what is a molecule? What is an atom?
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.240]   Atoms are clustered together, the four molecules. Well, what's, what's an atom? Okay, atoms comprised
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:51.840]   of three basic elements. Okay, what is those when like, what makes an electron? We asked what makes
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.400]   a atom? Okay, so at atoms comprised of three different things, protons neutron electrons.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.720]   So what makes up an electron? What, you know, what is that thing made out of? And so right now,
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.440]   if you look at classical physics, it says, well, you know, an electron, let's say, as an example,
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:10.560]   is an elemental physical particle. But what is it made out of? And so that's kind of what
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.040]   they tried to figure out. Now back then, you know, they just kind of were, you know, basically
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.840]   theorizing all of this. And they've come a long way since then, in terms of being able to identify
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.760]   atoms and all of the different things that comprise atoms and molecules and so forth and
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.520]   atomic particles. However, you have a different way of thinking about it now. You've got the
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:35.760]   Mendeleev, not the Mendeleev, but the classical physics way of looking at quantum as particle-based,
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:42.320]   and then you've got the Lord Kelvin way of looking at the, you know, the structure of quantum,
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:50.880]   the world of quantum is not necessarily particle-based, but it's, you know, basically made up of vortices.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:56.400]   Now, in current modern day physics or modern day science, it's also, you know, there's other
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.360]   individuals that are out there promoting that concept and basically saying, hey,
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.920]   this is, you know, this is their theory as well. They think that Lord Kelvin was correct. And one
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.080]   of those individuals is a Dr. Jerry Tennant. And he's the author of a book series called
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:19.920]   Healing Is Voltage. This gentleman is, since 1965, has been working on microcurrent therapy. And he
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:27.600]   is literally the godfather of microcurrent therapy. And he's also the individual who's credited for
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:33.040]   literally figuring it out, figuring out how bioelectrics operates and how our bodies
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:40.080]   are bioelectric machines. And he's basically, he is the godfather of microcurrent technology and
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:46.320]   microcurrent therapy, extremely well respected in his field. And he's actually just most recently,
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:52.080]   two years ago, wrote a book. And up until two years ago, you know, he had a little bit different
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.440]   view. He looked at like basically healing his voltage. It's all about bioelectricity and about
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:02.000]   polarity and, you know, in terms of bio-magnetics of your body. But now within the last couple of
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.280]   years, he wrote a book, he's been lecturing on it. And he's come up with this in theory of how,
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:13.120]   you know, the reason that he's getting the results he's getting and the reasons that all of the things
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:20.560]   that he does in his research is because, and this is his theory, that the atoms themselves that,
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.760]   you know, like electrons and all of themselves are not particles, like, you know, and this is,
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:31.680]   you know, what he deduced, but they're actually vortices of energy and that the actual protons
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:38.560]   themselves are microscopic black holes and electrons are vortices of energy that, you know,
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.440]   obviously circle that. So in other words, that the lower you go, the smaller you go along the,
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.720]   you know, the, you know, as in terms of, you know, drilling down into what makes or what comprises
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.640]   matter, the smaller you go, eventually you get to a point where the particle is not a particle
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:01.840]   anymore, but it's a vortex of energy, just like Lord Kelvin had theorized 160 years prior.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:08.960]   And so this is what's interesting with this theory about, you know, is the, is quantum, is the nature
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.880]   of our universe energy based, right, is it's all comprised of these little energy vortices that
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:21.280]   comprise everything that we see. And that means that everything is energy and it's not physical,
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:27.120]   which is, you know, hard to wrap your head around. But I want to point out something that the jury's
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:33.040]   out. You know, there's nobody that can say that it's right or wrong right now, because most recently,
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:38.480]   you know, according there, well, not according to, but thanks to Cornell University, they came up
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:47.120]   with a new process by which to use an electron microscope to basically view atoms. The picture
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:56.480]   on your screen is an image of a crystal zoomed it at 100 million times magnification. It is the
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:04.160]   most, it is the, I guess I guess the best way to say it is, it's the closest picture of an actual
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:10.240]   atom. And the best picture we can get with the technology we have today. And that those little
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:15.440]   little lights you see are individual atoms, you'll see some of them are paired up, you'll see some of
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:22.720]   them are singular. But this is what an atom looks like. And this is the best we can do. We can't tell
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:28.400]   what this little glob of light is. We know it's an atom that's as far as we can get right now with
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:34.080]   today's technology. But we cannot answer what is beyond this, like what, you know, looking through
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:40.400]   a microscope at an atom like what, what, what is this? It's just this little, little bit of light.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:46.080]   And so that's where we're at right now. So we can't say that we're not energy based. We can say we're,
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:51.360]   you know, we can say, is this a particle? Or is this a little glowing vortices of energy? We can't
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.800]   tell you right now, we meaning, you know, humanity. And so that's what's really interesting about the
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:02.320]   theory that, you know, maybe the world or the nature of the universe isn't necessarily particle
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.920]   based. But instead, maybe those particle base, those particles are actually energy vortices. So
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:14.320]   we've got that second theory here, you know, the second nature of the universe idea in trying to
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:22.000]   define like, what is quantum energy? And maybe, maybe theory is that quantum energy is based on this,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.400]   you know, this model that everything is energy and quantum is that energy. And so there's a very
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:34.160]   highly probable answer right there. But again, you know, just like any other theory, it's not set
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.960]   in stone right now. It literally now, what I want to do point out is that even under particle
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.840]   physics, you know, even though the definition of particle physics and what Layla is doing,
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.520]   you know, they don't match up because there's no particles. But I want to point out, though,
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:52.960]   we just don't know if there are particles that we just haven't been able to detect. Okay, so,
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.440]   you know, we scientists learn something new every day. If you ever want to think that, you know,
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:02.320]   we know everything that there is to know, just Google scientists discovered, and you will get
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:07.280]   pages after pages of stuff they discover every single day. So, you know, we're always learning,
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:13.040]   we're always growing our knowledge base. So maybe it is a particle. Okay, maybe quantum energy
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:18.000]   is particle based. We just haven't been able to measure it. We haven't been able to identify,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.560]   you know, all that stuff that they do. And so it, it may or may not be particles
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:28.480]   highly suspected that it's just that maybe the nature of the universe is energy. And it is that
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:34.160]   energy that that energy ether, right, that they tried to define earlier is quantum energy. And
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.440]   so there's a highly probable explanation as to what quantum energy is when you look at the world
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:45.600]   in terms of energy, vortices, comprising atomic, semi subatomic particles. So, but there's a third
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:49.840]   one. And I want to share that with you, because this one is where it gets really interesting.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:55.040]   And you know, I've been noodling on this for a very long time. And so one of the things that
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:01.840]   popped up in the research I've been doing is that, you know, is there another possible explanation
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:10.720]   that's even better than the energy definition that would basically be able to answer the,
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.760]   you know, how is all of this happening? You know, how is all of this happening when you've got this
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.760]   little aluminum plate thing with rods on it? And then this incredible reaction happens
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:29.280]   to people, plants, animals, and substances, right? And is there something else going on? Now,
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:34.400]   energy could explain it, but there's actually another model I run across that I think even
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:42.400]   explains it even better. So the idea here is that in 2003, a philosopher Oxford University,
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:49.680]   his name is Nick Bostrom, he came up with something he came calls the simulation hypothesis. Now,
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:55.520]   that's going to that was proposed by philosopher Nick Bostrom in 2003. And it's the idea that we
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.640]   might be living in a computer simulation created by a more advanced civilization.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:06.400]   Yeah, obviously, when he published that, it took the, you know, the world of physics by storm because
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:12.800]   nobody could even imagine that it would, you know, like, that's just sounds crazy. But the idea was,
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:21.040]   was that we today, our technology, CGI technology, today, if you look at any really, really advanced
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:27.040]   video game and all of the experience of the video game with VR, and all of those types of things,
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:34.240]   you know, it's almost to the point now where if you watch a video that it's so realistic,
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.960]   it's incredibly realistic and the characters and all of that, it's becoming realistic. Now,
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.360]   imagine a thousand years from now, where we take where we're at today, and we go a thousand years
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:48.960]   in the future, and we're able to then create holographic 3D representations of characters with
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.120]   built-in AI. And so that, you know, you've got, and then, you know, and so that you've got these
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.840]   characters that are just basically, you know, autonomous, you know, individuals out there with
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:04.320]   their own personalities through AI. And you can imagine a thousand years from now,
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.200]   what video games are going to look like. And maybe one of those video games is us. And that's
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.880]   what's really bizarre. It's like, we are we a sim character, just incredibly advanced sim character
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:21.680]   thinking that we're human. And that's what his theory was. And so that is pretty wild. However,
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:29.200]   what's interesting about simulation hypotheses is now this was 2003. Now, in 2016, at the,
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:34.960]   you know, I want to introduce with you a gentleman by the name of Dr. James Gate. Now,
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:40.800]   he is a theoretical physicist with the University of Maryland. Now, he was working on string theory.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:47.280]   And so this is another little piece. String theory is a theoretical framework of in physics that
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:52.560]   attempts to unify all fundamental forces of nature, gravity, electromagnetism, strong and weak
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:59.440]   nuclear forces into a single consistent theoretical framework. So in other words, he's a physicist,
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.920]   he's a theoretical physicist. And one of the biggest challenges in physics, right, is they've
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:14.000]   never been able to basically tie together the things that happen in large things like the
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.560]   universe itself, the solar system, gravity, right? And then when they translate that down to the
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:24.240]   quantum realm of atomic particles, where there's almost no gravity, you know, they've never been
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:30.000]   able to reconcile the two between large and small quantum and, you know, the universe, right? And
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.960]   so they, you know, Einstein's greatest regret was he was not able to solve that before he passed.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.600]   James Gates, just one of many, many incredible physicists that's working on, hey, you know, like,
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.200]   you know, how does, you know, what's the answer to all that? We, you know, human beings, all we've
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.840]   ever asked is, you know, what is the meaning of life? And this is all these people do is try to
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:53.680]   figure that out. What is the meaning of life? What is the nature of the universe? And so James Gates,
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:28:00.000]   Professor Gates, was working on string theory and mapping out all of the different, you know,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.280]   equations that come up with this theory on trying to explain the universe. And what was
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:09.920]   interesting was, is he also came up with this new discipline called supersymmetry, where he
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:19.120]   basically was trying to create the visual representation of the equations in a geometric format. Okay.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:28.400]   And so in 2016, at the Isaac Asimov, Asimov, memorial debate held by the American Museum of
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:35.680]   National History, the presenter or the host of the event was Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, you might
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:41.520]   recognize him. He's one of the more famous TV personalities in physics today, was just basically
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.760]   dialoguing with the panel. And they were talking about simulation, they were talking about the
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:51.680]   simulation hypotheses during this discussion in 2016. So, you know, 13 years later, they're,
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.760]   you know, physicists are still trying to figure out, you know, are we living in a simulation?
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:00.800]   And so he discovered something that I just want to go ahead and play to you to give you an example
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:06.880]   of or, you know, of the possibility that, you know, are we living in a simulation? So it's best in
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.680]   his own words. I'll go ahead and share that with you now. Part seven, well, partly it's taken to
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:17.200]   these very strange images that are behind your head right now. These are pictures of equations.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.080]   I've been, for the last 15 years, trying to answer the kinds of questions that my
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   colleagues here have been raising. And what I've come to understand is that there are these
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:31.520]   incredible pictures that contain all the information of a set of equations that are related to string
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:36.000]   theory. And it's even more bizarre than that, because when you then try to understand these
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.920]   pictures, you find out that buried in them are computer codes, just like the type that you find
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:47.680]   in a browser when you go surf the web. And so I'm left with the puzzle of trying to figure out
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:53.520]   whether I live in the matrix or not. Right, you're blowing my mind at this moment. So you're saying,
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:30:00.320]   are you saying your attempt to understand the fundamental operations of nature leads you to a
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:06.640]   set of equations that are indistinguishable from the equations that drive search engines and
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:13.360]   browsers on our computers. That is correct. So, wait, I'm still, wait, I have to just be silent
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:26.640]   for a minute here. So you're saying as you dig deeper, you find computer code rich in the fabric
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:33.760]   of the cosmos. Into the equations that we want to use to describe the cosmos, yes. Computer code.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:40.640]   Computer code. Strings of bits of ones and zeros. It's not just sort of resembles computer code.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:46.320]   You're saying it is computer code. It's not even just is computer code. It's a special kind of computer
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.920]   code that was invented by a scientist named Claude Shannon in the 1940s. That's what we find very,
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:57.920]   very deeply inside the equations that occur in string theory. And in general, in systems that
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:08.880]   we can say are supersymmetric. Okay. Time to go home, I think. I mean, where are we going to go out?
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.480]   So, yes, you really said that and you really found that. And the idea here, as you stipulated,
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:20.320]   was that not only did you find code, actual computer code buried within the equations of
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:27.920]   string theory, which is the theory, the mathematical equations that define space and time and nature
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:33.280]   and universe. But there's actual computer code buried in it, but not just any computer code.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:38.560]   And what I want to kind of point out, and this is really important, is that they're error-correcting
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:44.720]   codes. Now, what is that? So, error-correcting codes, if you're a programmer, is basically computer
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:50.160]   code that's embedded in all code. Because when information's transferred from one computer to
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:57.040]   another computer, the information, the data packets, get corrupted a little bit either through lag time,
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.960]   you know, all sorts of different reasons why, you know, that you're not going to get the same
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:05.840]   information you send from one place to another. And so, what the code does is a double, it does,
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.880]   you know, basically it does checks along the way so that at the end, when it receives it,
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:16.160]   it checks to make sure that if there was any errors, it fixes it so that the receiving end
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:21.280]   gets the exact same version of the information that was sent to it from the sending end. Okay, so,
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:26.080]   error-correcting codes is a very important aspect of this discussion. So, now, let's talk about the
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.880]   next piece that collaborates that. So, that was in 2016, and scientists are like, "Whoa, there's
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.920]   computer code." And so, they've been working on that now. And so, now, in 2024, just this last month,
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:42.400]   in April of 2024, University of Portsmouth scientist, Melvin Vopson, who formulated the
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:48.400]   second law of infodynamics, which establishes that entropy. A measure of disorder in an isolated
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:54.000]   system can only increase or stay the same, but it will never decrease. And so, kind of, you know,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.080]   that's a complicated subject. Just keep in mind that entropy is a measure of the disorder
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:06.320]   and randomness of uncertainty of a system. So, any system you have, if you leave it running,
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:10.720]   okay, for, you know, for a very long time, think like, you know, any one of your computers,
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.200]   after a while, you're gonna have to reboot it, right? And that's the whole idea is that, you know,
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:20.080]   it's just chaos, right? Anything that just goes on and on and on and on, for way too long, it's
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:24.480]   eventually gonna have some kind of weird, you know, thing with it. And you just have, you know,
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:29.200]   it's just called entropy. And entropy increases over time, you know, the randomness and chaos and
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:34.400]   disorder, okay? And that he came up with this law of the second law of infodynamics, which
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:39.360]   basically, you know, validated that through all of his research and his, his, his mathematics and so
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:45.520]   forth. But what he discovered, and this is what's real important and how it ties to Professor Gates,
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:51.520]   is that based on the famous law of the second law of infodynamics, Vopsin,
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:57.680]   similarly expected that entropy in information systems, which is previous research defined as
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:02.640]   the fifth, the fifth state of matter, should similarly increase over time. Okay, so that's,
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:07.280]   you know, he studied it. He said, yeah, it should increase over time. entropy in anything is gonna
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:14.880]   go up because, you know, but when he started really looking at information systems, he found that it
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:20.720]   doesn't in, in, you know, according to his mathematics. And that instead entropy, you know, entropy,
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:27.200]   it remains constant or even decreases to a minimum value at equilibrium. So Vopsin claims
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:33.520]   that the decrease of entropy in information systems over time, by that by itself, right,
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:39.840]   now they're not doing anything, proves that the universe has a built in data optimization and
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:46.240]   compression, which speaks to its digital nature. So this individual is working separately. He wasn't
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:52.160]   necessarily working on Gates's theory. He was working on his own theory and separately discovered
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:35:00.560]   when it came to information systems, that it has the universe has a built in data optimization and
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:05.920]   compression. And so what is that? Well, that's error correcting code. Right. And so this is what's
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:13.040]   fascinating about the idea. So when you think about this possibility, the simulation hypotheses,
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:20.560]   then you've got your third model of understanding your third framework by which to try to understand
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:26.560]   and for me to try to explain to you what my theory is. And my theory here is that, hey, you know,
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:34.960]   it's either a particle based energy that we have not discovered and or defined in modern physics,
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:41.280]   or it follows the work of Lord Kelvin and Jerry Tenet. And it's actually energy based and the
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:47.600]   particles themselves are made up of energy. And so we either all particles or all energy. Right.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.920]   But there's this third thing where it might be that we're actually living in a simulation.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:36:00.240]   We're not real. And that everything is code based and information based. Now, in the next video,
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.120]   when I get into like, what are we finding? And how does it fit into one of these three definitions?
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:10.320]   I think what we're going to find is that it's not any one of these three, but it's probably
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:15.200]   all three of them in one form or another. And it's combined. So but then, you know, what is
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.760]   my theory? Right. So I'm just walking you through the thought process. And so my theory, as I went
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:25.440]   through all of the research, I think it's probably one or all of the three. I really do. I think that
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:35.040]   quantum energy is an energy that exists in the simulation we're living in. But you know, I want
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:43.120]   to point out something to that in the research. When you look at Ayurvedic philosophy, there's this
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.920]   thing called the Pancha Buddha. And so when I was looking at this, and you know, and that's your
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:52.480]   typical, what are the elements that comprise reality of, you know, of the universe, right? So
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:58.720]   there's earth, water, fire, and air. And then the Ayurvedic philosophers, and this goes back
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:04.400]   thousands of years, right? They also have this fifth element called space, or they call it Akasha.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:10.080]   And they define it as the subtle and expansive element that represents consciousness, awareness,
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:15.520]   and potential. In other words, it's basically this element, right? That comprises all of these
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:20.160]   things. And I'm going to get into consciousness in the next video. But that has a lot to do with
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:25.840]   this, you know, in terms of the energy, and they're very much tied together. And so with the idea of
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:33.760]   Akasha, then the idea here is that there's five elements to the nature of the universe. And that
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:41.760]   ether is one of the five. And that either that this quote quantum energy that permeates reality
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:49.680]   is a fifth element of nature. And it's actually exists because we, we, you know, like you proved
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.800]   it exists. Everybody's been trying to figure it out since, you know, since it first was even thought
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   up, the Ayurvedic philosophers thought it up a long time ago, and they called it Akasha. But here
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:06.240]   is where I think that according to Ayurvedics, you know, the Ayurvedic philosophers that
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.160]   when they first came up with this idea of there's this energy, you know, that that's all around us.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:17.120]   And that it's called Akasha, or as modern day, you know, Western civilization, I think it's called
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:25.280]   ether. And so my answer to the question as of right now, in 2024, what is quantum energy? It's
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:32.000]   ether. But it's a different form of ether than Mendeleev thought it was. And it's, you know,
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.320]   and it's based on energy being the smallest particle, most likely that we're living in a
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:43.840]   simulation to. So that's the best I can do. I just kind of wanted to throw this out at you and throw
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.760]   you, you know, throw out the research that, you know, this is for discussion. I want to get you
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:52.640]   guys engaged. And I'd love to hear what you think as well. But this is where I'm at right now. When
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:58.480]   someone asks me, what is quantum energy? My answer is, it's the fifth element. It's, it's, and then,
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.120]   you know, I'll point him to the video to understand the details. So anyway, that's part one. Thank
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:07.600]   you for watching. Now, this part two, I want to let you know I'll be working on that after this
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.520]   video. And this is where we're going to get into how does it work? What is quantum entanglement,
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:16.560]   the role of consciousness, quantum healing, frequency medicine, what is all that? How does it work?
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:20.240]   And then also, too, you know, how do you measure this energy? So I want to say thank you very much
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:26.000]   for watching the video. I hope this was educational and intriguing for you to kind of think about,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.680]   wow, you know, what is quantum energy? And more importantly, I think, because it needs to fit into
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:37.520]   context. And the context is what's nature of our reality? What's the nature of universe? And,
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:42.080]   and what is everything made up of? And how does it work? I mean, it's just a great thing to kind of
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:46.960]   figure out. And it really helps define who we are. So hey, thanks a lot for watching the video.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.280]   Hope you enjoyed it. If you want to learn more about me and my work and the stuff that I do,
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:56.880]   you can find me at the at the Tinkers Academy at my blog, link below in the description. And if
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:01.440]   you like this kind of content, just like and subscribe. And I really appreciate you guys watching my
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:05.840]   videos and your very kind comments. So I do would like to hear from you what you think. Is it one
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:10.880]   of those three? Is it all three? Is it is it a kasha? Is it is it cheese? Is it, you know, source energy?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.600]   you know, what do you think? And so thanks a lot for watching. Have a great day. Aloha.
