[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.120]   Keelmer and this video is an introduction to do-it-yourself micro current. So there's
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.480]   various therapies, multiple different devices and all the accessories that go
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.160]   with them. If you're interested in having a little handheld device that can help
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.560]   you manage pain and manage pain plus healing. So that's what this is all
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.080]   about and let's go ahead and jump right in. So the very first thing obviously I
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.760]   got some disclaimers. This video is not medical advice and also I don't have
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.880]   any affiliation with any products mentioned. I don't sell anything. I'm not
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.280]   an affiliate any of that stuff. This is just about like what I know and all the
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.680]   different things that I own and I want to share it with you because YouTube is
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.400]   essentially adult show and tell. Here's my presentation. Okay now the thing that
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.200]   you do need to know about microcurrent those. Number one the most important
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.040]   thing is do not use microcurrent device. Don't use any bio electrical magnetic
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.800]   device if you have electrical implants. If you've got something inside of you
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.520]   that that runs on electricity you don't want to be zapping yourself with
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.160]   electricity. It is common sense but needs to be stated. Okay and also you
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.440]   know clearly do not use if you are pregnant or are in chronic ill health.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.240]   There's just not enough research. If you go to you know Google Scholar and you
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.560]   start looking up like you know what microcurrent tends you know all these
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.520]   different acronyms I'm going to share with you. There's tons there's tons of
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.040]   studies that are basically you know proving the efficacy of these types of
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.520]   devices and these modalities. However you know there's very little about you
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.080]   know what does it happen if you've got a baby in you or you're super super
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.600]   still you know six stage four gonna you know so it is I don't recommend that. I
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.680]   just don't think that you know don't take that risk specifically especially
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.040]   if you're pregnant. Okay so that's not for you and also to the thing that a lot
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.400]   of people don't realize about using bioelectric devices. Excuse me is that
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.760]   scars. Excuse me are problematic with the flow of current in the body. So if
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.320]   you're trying to send a current from one point to another point in your body and
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.400]   you know you have a scar it's going to interfere with that current flow. So you'll
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.840]   have to be really you know aware of that in terms of your probe placement to get
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.720]   the best effects. Now for best results okay this is what's key to is that
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.240]   optimal hydration and mineralization is required. If you're dehydrated or you're
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.120]   just you know you're really minerals insufficient the electricity in your
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.160]   body is not going to travel very well and you just won't get the we won't get
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.560]   optimal benefits by using these two devices and you probably feel like crap.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.440]   So you need to be really hydrated because what water is a conductor and
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.040]   minerals are conductors in order for your electricity in your body to flow on a
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.640]   normal basis and even more so if you're in a healing situation where you need
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.500]   some healing. So these devices you know they work best when you are hydrated and
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.800]   mineralized. And lastly when you're putting electrodes on your body I don't
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.920]   know sometimes people need to know but clean your skin. You don't want you
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.240]   want as less amount of stuff between the probe and your body as possible and so
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.120]   being very very clean where you put your probes is also a best results technique.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.440]   Okay now the thing about microcurrent and you're probably wondering this
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.600]   already but this is what's key about it and this is all has a ton of science to
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.240]   support it. Okay as I mentioned so now what the benefits are of microcurrent
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.440]   therapy is the number one thing that it does is it increases ATP production. Now
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.960]   that's the energy that fuels all of your biochemical functions in your body. It is
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.320]   literally the gasoline by which you run. If you don't have ATP or you have low
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.920]   ATP you will know it you will feel it and you will not feel very well. If you
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.120]   didn't have any ATP you would drop dead. That's how important ATP is. So this
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.640]   actually increases ATP in your body and that also reduces pain reduces
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.840]   inflammation and reduces swelling. It improves circulation and cellular
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.120]   metabolism and here a very high point here now is that it accelerates
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.360]   wound healing and injury recovery. That's why I own several of these. I'll show
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.920]   you to show them to you in a second but I own them to to basically manage pain
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.800]   and then even more so I own them to help me heal and you know and heal
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.160]   injuries of all certain makes and you know models. Okay and they're
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.200]   exceptional at doing that and it can heal all sorts of stuff. Everything from
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.080]   migraines to constipation you name it. It has got you know the microcurrent
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.840]   devices and microcurrent therapy is an incredible drug-free no side effects
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.400]   approach towards modern medicine that you know for whatever reason right
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.560]   our doctors would rather give us drugs but this is an alternative to that
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.480]   works extremely well. You buy the device once and you don't ever have to go and
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.240]   get any more pills right and maybe that's could be a reason why you don't hear
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.760]   about it but it works and it works great and so I highly recommend you you know
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.960]   you try this if you haven't already. Lastly it increases range of motion and
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.960]   muscle function and it also is could be used for vagus nerve stimulation which
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.520]   is a real big deal if you understand what the vagus nerve is and it's rolled in
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.920]   basically your body and how it basically runs everything. You know and so it
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.680]   being able to stimulate that put yourself into a parasympathetic or
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.480]   sympathetic you know response it can help manage stress it can help with
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.320]   digestion I mean there's so much stuff you could do by simply stimulating your
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.000]   vagus nerve and then lastly you know it the microcurrent this is the weird thing
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.160]   about where the phrase microcurrent stands right now if you Google it or you go
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.560]   into YouTube and you search for microcurrent you're gonna get a just a dump
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.280]   truck full of videos and information about how microcurrent is for cosmetics
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:03.080]   and because it does work it tones and sculpts facial muscles and improves the
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.040]   elasticity it's exceptional for cosmetics but the cosmetic industry has
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.680]   completely basically hijacked the word microcurrent and you really have to dig
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.200]   to find out what else can microcurrent do and you know and and where do you go
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.360]   from there so I'm not gonna even go into the cosmetic aspect of it that's my
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.000]   my thing at all I could care less on my guy but it's really good on that and then
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.080]   you know like I just said if you try to find anything on microcurrent you're
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.120]   gonna have to dig for it in terms of how it works for pain and healing because
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.880]   all you're gonna get is just tons and tons of content about you know you know
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.480]   cosmetics uses of it which is good by the way now so anyway it reduces fine
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.320]   lines and wrinkles and it diminishes breakouts and acne and yes all this
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.760]   stuff at what it what it really does lots of science lots of studies that
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.000]   support every one of these bullets so it's a it's a really great thing it
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.920]   really is a great thing so now again as I mentioned there's different types of
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.280]   microcurrent devices the two that are that I'm focusing on and am focused on is
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.400]   pain and then pain plus healing devices again as I mentioned there's cosmetic
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:13.680]   devices or devices for your head for cranial stimulation from everything from
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.560]   helping you with the stress to addiction there's even cranial devices that'll
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.160]   help you improve your memory you know if you're like a student you had to learn
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.200]   something you turn that thing on and helps you remember and there's these
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.640]   things called zappers which are also a microcurrent device by definition if you
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.080]   just look up the word what is microcurrent mean by definition you've got zappers
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.880]   and those are referred to as like path and bed zappers clark zappers are
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.400]   meant to just basically eliminate pathogens and parasites things like that
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.640]   so those are the world of zappers but they're microcurrent devices based on the
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.440]   you know definition but this video I'm going to be talking about pain and pain
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.680]   plus and so like again if you go on Google and you type in microcurrent
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.800]   devices look at all the different this thing this is just the snapshot of the
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.720]   Google page of just all the different available microcurrent devices and the
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.960]   thing scrolls down to like 3040 pages because there's just so many different
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.560]   devices out there so there's a lot to know about what one is best for you and
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.800]   what you know depending on what you want to use it for but yeah there's
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.320]   different devices I'm gonna be talking about pain and pain plus today so now
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.160]   this is what the pain and pain plus therapies are in the microcurrent world
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.000]   now your number one's most available readily available one and there's I
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.600]   guess would be over a hundred different models of just a 10s device now what
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.880]   that stands for is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and it
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.240]   just uses low voltage electrical currents to relieve pain that's it that's
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:47.280]   all it does okay that's all it does you it just it gives you a higher than normal
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.920]   level of microcurrent that the other devices are have lower but this one has
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:57.200]   a high one and it's all meant to just simply block your pain it's gonna numb
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.480]   out your nerves and you don't feel the pain so it works great if pains all your
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.160]   all you're concerned about but it's not meant for helping you heal but like I
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:11.400]   said because it does send current from one probe to the other probe you can use
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.320]   it to stimulate your vagus nerve and that's probably the only healing aspect
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.560]   of a 10-unit that I am aware of is using it for vagus nerve stimulation but a
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.200]   10-unit purely for pain now there's other units out there and there's these
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.960]   combo units and they'll have something called EMS now EMS stands for electrical
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.040]   muscle stimulation which involves sending electrical impulses to your muscles to
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:37.400]   promote blood flow and strengthen your muscles so like people who have gone into
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.400]   surgery and let's say their leg is you know atrofeed you'll get though the
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.760]   doctors will prescribe an EMS device they put the EMS device on and it starts
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.120]   just pulsing the muscles of the of the leg that atrofeed and helps the muscles
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:55.080]   you know basically bulk back up and that's what it's for you know so it's
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.360]   kind of like a little massage unit for your muscles and that's what that one's
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.480]   for you know and it helps for pain as well now IF is interferential stimulation
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.760]   it's a type of electrical stimulation for pain relief again and healing so it
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.160]   does have a healing component and the thing about it is it involves the
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.800]   simultaneous application of two sine waves at different frequencies so this
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.040]   is where you get into this world of oh instead of just sending current you're
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.960]   sending current plus frequency and that's when you get into IF and you also start
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:32.520]   getting into SFSM which is frequent frequency specific microcurrent and these
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.880]   are these are all the different acronyms I'm sorry guys this is how it is and now
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.960]   FSM is it like a gentle nudge to your body's natural healing system it uses
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.000]   tiny electrical currents like what your nerves already use to target source
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.600]   spots and it also helps with pain inflammation and it helps speed up
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:57.440]   healing so now FSM and IF both use two different basically two different outputs
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:03.320]   each one has a different frequency on it and it's based on the combination of
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.040]   those two creating a little harmonic so it's really different in the world of
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.800]   microcurrent devices but the whole idea though it's more like there's a frequency
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   induced in there and the different sine waves that are used and I won't get too
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.040]   technical but that's the difference between just a something to numb you out
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.240]   something to pulse your muscles versus something to actually send you a
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.120]   frequency all right into your wherever you're sending the current so it's current
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:33.480]   plus frequency now the last one is the CNR now CNR stands for self-controlled
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:38.120]   Ergo neural adaptive regulator it's a device that was created by the Russians
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.960]   years and years ago it's a computerized transdermal device that uses biofeedback
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.400]   to help the body heal itself with pain and dysfunction the CNR transmits a
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.800]   radio signal I'm not a radio signal but a signal into nerve receptors in the
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.840]   skin and then listens to the body's response and then basically interacts
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:02.440]   with your brain figures out what's the best frequency and amount of current to
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.880]   send based all on its circuitry and its little mini-daddy base that's in the
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:11.320]   device and then sends that specific frequency and current into wherever the
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.880]   probe is based on what your brain told it to do and what it knows from its
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.960]   database so it's a really really high-tech and it is and they're the most
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:25.560]   expensive devices on top of the clinical versions of the FSM otherwise
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.800]   these are you know the point of this video is about DIY so these are all
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.280]   things you can do at home but and this is the way you could do it if you want to
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.440]   do FSM at home there is a way to do or that or IF or you can do CNR handheld
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.880]   devices I'm not going to get into what people use in clinics which are large
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.360]   devices really super expensive but you know based on all the same technology
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:49.760]   now the last one here is just wanted to share with you before I get into the
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.600]   demonstration video is the selection criteria now if you're out looking for
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.480]   like you know you're interested in this and you're like hey you know how much
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.320]   money do I want to spend and and what what should I get then that's what this
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.160]   video is to kind of explain what your choices are now the objective here is
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.360]   what what's your objective again this video is only about pain and pain plus
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.440]   but if that's your thing then you've got lots and lots and lots of choices
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.640]   what's your budget that's the first thing if you're just going after pain
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.680]   you know these two devices here these all are all are under $100 and they're
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.720]   just simple tens units they're simple microcurrent devices
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.280]   and they do work for pain if that's all you want to care about
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:30.440]   you can get by with easily under $100 now of course now if you start looking at
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.760]   some of these more advanced models they have
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.600]   a lot more features and a lot more support that comes with it
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.800]   and also there's this concept of home models right
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.920]   models that you would use at home other and then models that they sell the
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.680]   clinicians that have a ton more features than just the home models
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.480]   now though like just to give an example if you were to buy like a scene art for
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:55.320]   home you're maybe spending like 500 but you want to buy a scene art of using
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.800]   your clinic that's a lot more robust with more
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.000]   features you're looking at you know 3000 so that kind of thing right so get
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.400]   really expensive if you want to do the pro versus home and of course I do the
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.600]   home versions of everything the other thing that's really important is the
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.800]   ease of use how easy is it to use these things
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.120]   and what's the learning curve and I'll share that with you in the demo
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.800]   video coming up next and lastly are there accessories
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.240]   you know specific electrodes for the specific thing you want to treat
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.720]   and that's what's really important if you want to let's say
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.880]   use an electro acupuncture electrode well they're not going to work with a
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.880]   tangent kind of thing so like if you want to do a specific thing you need to
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:36.120]   make sure you've got a that their electrode exists for that or a pad
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.240]   and then secondly is like what does it plug into and then you know that kind
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.840]   of makes your decision so here we go let's jump into the
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.360]   the demo video where I go over my different devices that I own and what I
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.560]   like and don't like and then all the different accessories that go with that
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.800]   and I do want to apologize in advance because the electrode piece of that
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.280]   video is a little shaky and you know I just kind of
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.440]   suck at that doing videos sometimes and that was one of those moments I want
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.760]   to apologize for that ahead because it does get a little shaky but you know I
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.080]   try my best anyway so here you go let's go talk with the demo now and kind of
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.560]   show you what's going on in my world all right so here's a quick demo of the
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.560]   different devices that I have and I just kind of want to walk you through
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.200]   the micro current devices and the different types so right off the bat
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.400]   I've got the soda bio tuner and this is for cranial
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:32.360]   applications and treats addiction and so forth so this is for your head
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.760]   and this one right here are these four right here are what I would call
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:42.360]   bexapers for parasites and pathogens and then in terms of
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.520]   actual like you know micro current devices specifically for pain and pain
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.680]   plus as I've been discussing this is my go to this is and these are the
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:55.160]   really inexpensive ones these two here but you know this is I chose this one a
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.280]   long time ago it's just really popular and it works just great
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.440]   it's perfect for pain and you know you can also use it to stimulate your
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.400]   vagus nerve as I mentioned and the thing that's really key about the
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:10.600]   difference between a 10s and other little micro current devices for pain
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:16.200]   and pain plus right for healing is its 10s units are dual channels you see how
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:21.000]   there's two different you know I guess jacks for the electrodes
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.880]   and then the same thing here with this model it's called the intensity
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:27.640]   it's got two different jacks so the whole idea though is you're going to have
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.680]   one electrode it's a separate electrode with two
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.120]   I'll show you in a second here and then you'll so basically you have two sets of
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.680]   electrodes two sets of electrode but every other one of these devices
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.960]   here these are cenars this is another micro current device
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:45.080]   every one of these others have only one output jack I guess I'll call it an
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.920]   output jack right there for one set at a time so
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.360]   10s or two sets at a time and again they're mainly for pain
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.800]   the thing about this guy here is he's purely just a 10s unit
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.080]   really inexpensive this guy's really inexpensive too we're talking under
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.280]   50 bucks and this one's the intensity now I kind of
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.080]   I chose this one because it was kind of like something I could play with
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:10.200]   it also does the it does it's a 10s unit but it's a four in one so it also does
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:16.040]   emf I'm sorry ems it does if and I think it does
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:19.000]   one other feature but it has multiple features
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.840]   and this is the buttons here for you know basically selecting the mode so
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.120]   these are your basic 10s units under 50 bucks
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.480]   if you're just you know focusing on pain and you're interested in like doing the
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.880]   vagus nerve stuff then these are really great little
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.280]   go-tos but the whole idea here you know it's about price right so the prices go
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.800]   up significantly when you start getting into more advanced ones
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.680]   actually before I jump into that I just want to point out this micro current
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:47.880]   device here this is basically it's an electro
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:53.000]   acupuncture device and so the probe right here there's no output jack this
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.640]   little probe right there you just put that on different
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.840]   acupuncture points and then you stimulate with micro current
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.360]   to those points and that's what this little butt guy does he's like under 50
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.200]   bucks as well single purpose though right so just like this one is single
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.680]   purpose these are all single purpose micro current devices this one's
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.240]   got multiple different modes but it's still a single purpose it's all for
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:20.200]   pain then you get into your more advanced micro current devices and this
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.480]   is a tenant bio modulator and then these two are
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:29.960]   Cenars this is an RITM company the Russian word for that is
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.600]   whatever that says and then this one here is the NASPCM 6 so what I want to
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.720]   point out though is that while these guys just do one thing roughly
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.200]   these guys do pain they they help with pain and it really works and they also
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.040]   really help with healing and they can put your body into a
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.240]   healing state and they can talk to your brain
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:54.040]   through biofeedback circuitry and to stimulate your body's natural
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.880]   wound healing processes or injury healing processes so
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.120]   they're quite advanced and the reason that they get kind of pricey
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.120]   from this point on is just basically the concept of you know ease of use and
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.160]   more features so the easier it is to use and the more
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.120]   features it has then you know you're definitely going to be
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.400]   paying a lot more money so this one here the RITM
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:21.480]   Sport Model D now this was this was the one with this just the LED lights
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.040]   and there's another one that has a little screen
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.360]   I don't even remember why I got this one I've had this like way over 10 years
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:33.720]   and so this one ease of use is a zero it sucks I never remember how to set
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.720]   these stupid lights every time I ever want to use this thing I got to go and
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.760]   watch the videos again and it just kind of a pain in the butt
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.360]   so I don't really use it however the funny thing is is this is
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.680]   probably one of the best devices I own so if I have a really cute problem and
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.200]   nothing else is working I'll pull this guy out watch the videos and
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.880]   go start using it again but the ease of use is horrible I mean you got
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.920]   out you got to know how the sequence of lights work you got to know I went to
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.400]   press the buttons and how long to press the buttons and
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.320]   it's paid so what I want to point out now this puppy goes for a round
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.640]   and in the day I paid like 350 I think they're going for like 5600 now
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.800]   and there's also more advanced models of this one now there's another advanced
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:18.440]   model of this this is the PCM6 it's also a CNR
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.640]   and one of the things that's nice about CNR is and again it is different it's a
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.040]   little bit of a unique take on microcurrent because
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.480]   they're just simply CNRs or just simply as I mentioned they have their own
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.800]   acronym they come out of Russia they are a microcurrent device
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.840]   but they've got the bat this is the thing they have
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.320]   these these are CNRs this is just a microcurrent device it's not a CNR
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.120]   but what they all have in common is they have
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:49.080]   basically biofeedback circuitry where it literally talks to your brain
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.080]   on your cross your nervous system and then basically stimulates
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.160]   your body's natural healing processes and that's what's really unique and that's
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.320]   why they're way more expensive than just a machine that outputs microcurrent
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.000]   these guys literally have circuitry that goes way beyond that in fact
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.800]   the tenant bio-modulator here has also body voltage it can measure cellular
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.440]   voltage and one of the key features about this
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:17.880]   guy is right here let me just flip it on
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.080]   and let's see I don't know if there's a battery in here I didn't check
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.440]   okay there's no battery in here like obviously do not store with batteries
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.240]   anyway so but if you see right here there's this little
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.720]   mode right there there's only four modes and the one mode here is automatic and
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.280]   that is what makes this one of the most superior
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.640]   products out there plus all the accessories plus the support system and
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.280]   the free training that comes with it but yeah
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.960]   with this thing the auto mode is a god send when you're just you know you
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.440]   don't feel like learning something new you pull this out put it in auto mode and
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.800]   then here's the probe right there and of course it has external probes with
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.040]   that shiny part right there is the electrode
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.560]   you just put it on whatever hurts and it's going to figure itself out and do it
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.120]   all just all by itself you don't have to learn
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.280]   anything you just put it in auto mode that's why this is one of the
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.960]   most expensive microcurrent devices on the market
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   because not only has doesn't have biofeedback capabilities it has
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:17.240]   cellular voltage meter it's also got a law all the intelligent circuitry
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.600]   in order for it to run in auto mode it literally can just touch you and know
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.120]   what to do this guy doesn't have that this this guy
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.800]   you've got to set it and then you then you then then it goes to work
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.560]   this guy you set it and go to work but what's really cool and what's advanced
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.360]   about the pcm6 and there is a pcm7 that just came out last year
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.560]   i'm going to show you here i turn this guy on if it's come on power up
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:45.560]   there we go excuse me now the pcm6 and seven they're
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.840]   basically it's the company's called the nasa pcm6
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.920]   there's a pcm7 this is the six but you see the venue right there and now what
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:58.120]   makes this super easy to use is you just simply just go to programs you
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:03.240]   click on programs and you say hey what hurts what hurts today and so let's say
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.920]   i pick anything i just say well you know what um
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.720]   let's see i'll just go ahead and pick one um i want to work on my head my throat
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.080]   hurts okay my throat hurts so i just click on that
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.160]   and right there you'll see it shows you where to put the uh with where you put
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.840]   the app of electrode again like a cnar this is the shiny
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:28.360]   part is the electrode this one here same thing right
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.720]   so right here it actually shows you where they do you have little pictures to
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.800]   follow so you go to any one of these options here
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.160]   and all of the different things it's got a let's say i got constipation
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:43.560]   and i click here and it shows hey you need to put the electrode right here
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.560]   and you go in a circle of motion uh you know counterclockwise starting at the
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.480]   belly button and then you click okay and then you go
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.560]   and you set uh you basically set your settings on on strength
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.160]   whoops got to go backwards right there and then i go to strength
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.760]   okay it's been a while old power and then you set the power the strength of the
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.840]   of the device in terms of uh how much it you know how much you can feel it
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.280]   and that's it i mean so that you can just imagine how much easier
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:15.640]   the pcm6 is to use because when i want to use it all i do is i just go
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.800]   and i go to the pick the program i want to run
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.960]   um i set the strength level and then boom i just touch it to myself or use an
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.960]   external electrode and the thing just you know it tells me what to do and then
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:32.360]   i just turn it on again like this there's you know you got no help at all
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.560]   this puppy here what's really cool about the denazas this puppy sells for
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.440]   under 300 bucks you can sometimes get them for like
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.120]   197 167 so highly recommend this one this is a
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.240]   really great little scener to have and to try out
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.560]   and then if you want like the Cadillac of of microcurrent device is going to be
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:54.040]   now the tenant biomodulator then the reason again one of the
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.680]   major reasons that this one is about three thousand dollars but
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:03.240]   the key here is not only does it have this automatic mode which no other
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.360]   senior has no other device has an automatic mode
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.480]   but it also comes with some really killer
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.240]   accessories that you can get for it on top of that
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.760]   the training you get a three-day training when you buy one of these you
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.000]   get a three-day full day three days of training that goes
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.880]   with that you can either attend it online which is what i did
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.080]   or you can go to the annual i guess i ghosted in their
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:31.160]   facility in texas and you can attend in person so
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.400]   and then there's a huge support line i mean there's just so much built around
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.440]   using this device in terms of support education materials information choice
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.440]   of electrodes and you name it and that's why it just cost so much
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.480]   because there's so much more wrapped around it than just oh hey you know
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.040]   go on amazon and pay 40 bucks and get a tense
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.240]   so that's the difference in the devices that i have i hope you found this
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.040]   interesting i'll do a separate video on how to pick out a
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.960]   bexapper not to be confused with clarge zappers but i won't go there and then
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:03.480]   that's it for now okay let's talk electrodes now going
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.840]   back to just the tens units um you basically have two
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:13.320]   flavors of electrodes and these are called tens pads and these are these
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.720]   sticky things that you're you know you'll find
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.000]   almost everywhere and they're pretty cheap and they come with the units
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.720]   themselves whether you know what depending on what
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.680]   ten unit you choose now there's going to be two sets of
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.720]   everything again you know there's two output jacks and so
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:31.240]   i typically you know these are the ones where you would put
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.440]   one on the black and red on each side of your
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.800]   area if you're just treating some sore muscles and pain
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.640]   one of my favorite electrodes or my pads it's a tens pad
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.240]   that i used when i when i used to use this all the time
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.320]   was this long puppy right here this thing's awesome i mean you know
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.480]   basically one side red one side's black but it's just one giant pad like this
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.360]   you see and you can put this right across your
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.800]   bottom of your back you know that's what i was treating for
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.520]   and instead of having to kind of position all these things all around
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.760]   your body you just slap on one big
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:09.480]   sticky plug it into your tans unit and off you go so i highly recommend these
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.640]   big long ones if you've got lower back pain but bottom line though these
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.120]   are the what these are your standard tans pads
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.240]   how they attach they attach through these little
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.160]   these little you know basically connectors they're very tiny
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.960]   and try to show you one right there so tiny that is
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.720]   and then that goes to the wire and then the wire comes out in a
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.960]   you know little like a little you know plug in there and it plugs right into
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.000]   your tans unit and that's kind of how that works it's
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.040]   really quite simple so these are the sticky ones that
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.880]   that get connected via wire and then the other types of tans
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.240]   pads that you can get and they come in all shapes and sizes are these little
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.040]   clip-ons and these connect with a clip instead of a
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.800]   little plug-in thing and so you just buy it you just you would basically buy
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.360]   the cords and you've got the clips and they just snap right on
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.320]   to the thing and then of course you can get different
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:06.600]   tans electrodes these are kind of like these are actual gloves and here's the
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.360]   clip-ons you can see right there you would basically plug the clip right
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.720]   into there snap it on put the glove on for things like
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.840]   treating neuropathy things you know whatever you've got
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.560]   on your hands you can use these for your hands
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:25.960]   this is also old school microcurrent for the users you know these
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.480]   clinical devices they would basically put the gloves on both hands connect
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.120]   themselves so that their hands are like you know microcurrent
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.560]   and then they would touch the patient so that's kind of how that works so you
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.560]   can either use the clip-ons or the electro connector ones
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.520]   they're all stickies these are stickies these are stickies and then of course
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.320]   you can wear and then you just plug it right into your
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:49.400]   your tans unit and off you go and that's as simple as it can get now
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.600]   the thing about all of this stuff is pushes to the side
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:58.040]   is all of the other units can also use 10 pads but
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.560]   these 10 units can't use all the other electrodes okay so that's where you know
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.840]   that's why you're getting it for under 40 we're 50 bucks right
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:09.320]   but you could use these 10 pads my favorite
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.920]   you could use these 10 pads with other devices so just like
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:16.760]   this one here this is what i was talking earlier this is the RITM
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:20.920]   sport model D and so now this guy you can like again and of course the
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:25.160]   bio-modulator you can plug in your 10s pads so you can make it a 10s
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.280]   but it also does much more so one of the things about that's really cool about
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:32.120]   the rim and the cinars is they've got this one long
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:37.240]   probe right here this goes with the RITM and it basically it's an
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:42.840]   extend it's basically an it's a external probe on a wire
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.920]   so that you can hold your device in one hand while you're manipulating the
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.280]   settings and then with your other hand put this like you know you
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.360]   put it on your back put it on your leg but it's just a lot easier to use
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.720]   with this external one than to actually use the electrode on the other side
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.560]   of this this case right here so now these come in different flavors i also
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:05.240]   have one of these same external extension electrodes
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:09.880]   right here now i use this if i use the bio-modulator i use this
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.680]   you know i rarely just put this thing on whatever hurts because i i'd like to
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.400]   hold this in my hand while i'm looking at it so i could
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.360]   see the different settings and or the different readouts
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.120]   and then i'm using this external basically it's an extension
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.080]   electrode for extension you know electrode on an extension cord
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.280]   so that's kind of what i do too so then now with this this old one here i don't
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.280]   use anymore i had the extension but also too i got this
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:39.240]   for trying to treat the dog this is for your scalp this is for your furry critters
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.520]   right here it's called it's called a brush electrode
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.600]   and basically it's the same thing as your extension electrode but instead of
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.800]   having a flat surface you've got something that can penetrate
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.000]   hair and fur and so then i would use that to treat
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.080]   my dog in fact if i ever need to do a microcurrent
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:01.240]   on the dog i gotta pull out the this guy again watch the videos and learn how to
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.960]   use it again and then i use this probe to go through the
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.480]   fur so that's kind of what's important again though you know with with animals
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:10.440]   though you know there is fur but just kind of give you a heads up
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.120]   if you don't have this electrode but you have one of these electrodes or just
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.160]   the device itself which hasn't built in electrode
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.200]   if you use electro gel it'll actually penetrate the fur as well in terms of
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.280]   the current will will penetrate the fur so you don't have to have a specific
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.880]   electrode for fur you just need some electrode gel
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.960]   and any any device in it'll go ahead and you can go ahead and use that device
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.880]   on the animal but of course you can't put stickers on an animal it just doesn't
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:43.080]   work now let's talk about advanced super advanced
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.160]   electrodes that come with the biomodulator well they don't come you have
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.600]   some come with them i forget which one comes within which one doesn't
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:55.000]   i bought the whole i bought the quote set so it all came with this stuff
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.360]   anyway so basically here's your biomodulator to an advanced micro current
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.000]   device and some of the electrodes i wanted you to be aware of
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.720]   this is big old wild electrode this thing is
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:09.080]   used specifically for vegas nerve stimulation also for also for reaching
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:12.600]   your back you can imagine how much easier it is to reach
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:17.000]   hard to reach places with this long electrode i talked about this puppy
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.280]   then you've got this little guy right there you see this guy right there
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.920]   now you know remember that electro electro acupuncture device well this
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.920]   is what this is a probe for that you can use this micro current device
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.040]   with this probe and you see that little tiny thing and then you just put that
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.200]   on your meridian points and you can do electro acupuncture with that
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.640]   warning do not use this for your teeth okay so but you can use this for
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:44.360]   electro acupuncture for pinpoint position and then you've got like when for one
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:49.160]   of the tenant protocols is full body charging like if you're really low on
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.640]   energy and you just need to do a full body charge
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.240]   then it comes with the foot plates and it also comes with the handhelds
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:33:00.200]   so you're kind of doing like some old school you know arcade kind of
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.760]   thing where you're holding on to the handhelds you got your feet on the
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:07.960]   plates and you're charging your whole body with micro current from head to toe
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:12.840]   to give yourself a full body voltage charge you know tenant is the father of
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:16.520]   healing with voltage so it's all about voltage right so that's kind of what
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.920]   these guys do is for that four-step protocol and then the
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:25.800]   crème de la resistance of the micro current world is the
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:30.360]   only one this guy that has this thing
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:35.240]   what is this thing you might ask it's called a biotransducer
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.440]   and what this does is it creates a scalar field
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.800]   and allows the micro current to penetrate
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:48.200]   deep into your tissues because it's the biggest issue and this is going to be
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:52.840]   something you all need to be aware of is no matter what device you have it's
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.840]   subjected to this rule of physics called the inverse square law
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:01.880]   and basically your body is going to absorb the energy coming into it
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.400]   whether the micro current or whatever other energy
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.400]   and as your body absorbs it specifically to micro current
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:14.120]   the whole idea those for every inch of flesh you have you're losing energy
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.440]   right so by the time it gets deep into you
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:21.400]   depending on how thick you are the actual current and or the frequency
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:25.880]   that's being carried by the current is so diminished because your bones and
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:30.040]   flesh have absorbed all that energy that it may never get all the way down
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.160]   to your let's say pancreas or you're trying to get into something
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:36.200]   now if you're super super skinny probably not an issue but the average
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.520]   American is not super super skinny so the idea behind
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.400]   this device right here the bile transducer was to not only
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.960]   basically broadcast it's like an antenna but it's a pinpoint antenna
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:53.000]   you turn this puppy on and it's going to then
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   basically using scalar waves it's going to send that current deep into your
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.560]   tissue so you can treat your internal organs
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.360]   because this guy right here and any one of these things
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.720]   is only going to basically work for anything that's like a couple inches
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:09.320]   deep in your body okay or you know like a few
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.640]   inches i don't even know what the math is all i know is that this is a thing
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:17.320]   so the so the reason that you would want this is
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:23.400]   for deep deep you know issues that you're treating deep inside your body if
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.280]   you're larger than the you know skinny little guy
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:31.160]   also too this guy i found has been it's exceptional at treating my animals
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:35.240]   when i want to treat the dogs getting them to sit around and letting me do
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.120]   this to them uh you know they're just not you know
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.920]   dogs right and so but what they're what i could do is
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.800]   while they're sleeping i just sit next to them and i'm just like waving the
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.680]   wand across them and i'm giving them a treatment and they
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.280]   don't even feel it because it's getting broadcast by this little antenna
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:54.440]   so this thing is really really valuable in terms of not only can it reach
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.200]   places that most of these other probes will never be able to reach in terms of
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.880]   giving you a full dosage of microcurrent but also too
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.720]   you can also treat animals all right so that's kind of how that works so
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.160]   again you know my main you know my main thing guys is
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.440]   this guy works great like when i just have my back is sore
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.720]   i'll take this guy and plug him into this guy
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.520]   you know because this is like my well fancy tens
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.720]   and i just slapped this on my back i love this guy and then of course i just i
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.440]   love this guy and i love this guy and so that's
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.680]   really kind of what what works here for me
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.120]   uh and there you go that's what you need to know about electrodes
