[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   >>Hello, everyone, and welcome to another C60 video by me, Kay Elmer, and in this video,
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:14.760]   we are going to go over the updated pricing guide for C60 Oil and C60 Powder Products.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.560]   The last update was October 2018.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.120]   I usually try to do these every three months and somehow forgot about it last month.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.440]   So anyway, updated it just today, spent a few hours doing it.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.160]   Hope you enjoy it.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.760]   This is right here on the front page is the very beginning of it.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.000]   Now, as you probably can imagine, if you've been following these updates, they're getting
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.760]   quite intense over time.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.680]   When I first started, November 17 or something, there was like nine.
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.280]   I mean, literally you Google C60 Oil, nine people popped up.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.840]   And since then, the list goes on and on and on, as you can see right here.
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.960]   And so there's been a huge influx of different oils, new merchants selling the oil, new merchants
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.520]   selling C60 Powder, and so forth, and of course, more than just in the United States.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.320]   So I had to really simplify it.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.840]   So this is the new format for the pricing guide and walk you through it, basically.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.160]   By the way, it's a link in the video description.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.880]   You can grab a PDF of what I'm showing you.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.080]   But right now, what I've done is I've basically kind of just categorized this by country now.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.200]   And mostly English-speaking countries, because I am a typical American and only speak and
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.040]   read one language.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.760]   So if it's not in English, it's not going on the list.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.160]   And so I basically give you the country.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.840]   So what that helps now is it helps me not have to translate the dollars into the like
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.960]   pound sterling or whatever, into US dollars.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.400]   So now when you see the cost, you're going to see that in the country.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.160]   So that's going to be a US dollar, pound sterling for UK, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar,
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.040]   Swiss francs, and so forth.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.760]   So that's now going to be a lot easier so you can see, because before I was actually
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.120]   doing the foreign exchange translation, and that's just too much work.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.640]   So then also too, this is real important right here.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.000]   I have changed the unit of measure for the apples to apples comparison now to 800 milliliters,
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.680]   because that seems to be across the industry, across different countries.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.600]   That seems to be like the standard now.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.240]   So there's everyone's kind of like gone up from the little tiny one ounce bottles, and
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.240]   they're now everybody's kind of just selling these hundred milliliters or bigger.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.600]   And so that has now become the standard by which these apple to apple cost comparisons
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.480]   are being made. And as you will note, this is a lowest cost to highest cost sort arrangement.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:00.920]   Now in terms of purity and the amount of C60 in the oil, if the information is readily available,
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.040]   meaning it's there and I can find it easily, it'll be on this pricing guide for you guys that
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.600]   don't put it on the webpage.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.200]   It's just I have no idea and neither will your consumers know the purity level of the C60
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.720]   powder you're using and the saturation rate, like how much C60 is in the oil.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.920]   And you know what at the end of the day, that's all that matters.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.240]   You're not buying a product, so you can take oil.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.240]   You're buying a product to take C60.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.960]   So as you know also too that the .8 is basically the standard for the industry,
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.840]   as well as 9.95, a 99.95% purity of the C60 powder that went into the oil.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.000]   And then what you'll notice too, what I've noticed is that there's a lot more folks
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.000]   using 99.99, they're really like reaching for the highest level, they're marketing that,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.040]   that they're using the highest level and so forth.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.680]   So that's pretty cool that the kind of the bar is being raised in terms of the purity.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.280]   Now, so these are the costs for 100 milliliters and then you know what's kind of interesting.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.960]   Now there's so many folks, these merchants that sell the oil that are actually selling the C60
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.560]   powder now. Oh, by the way, the shortage is over if you didn't catch the last video.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.800]   And so there's no shortage anymore and so there's lots of different folks selling C60 powder along
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:26.280]   with selling C60 oil. So the and the standard is like the 99.95 or better and this is the prices.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.760]   So if they sell it, it's going to be listed under this column and you can see if you're out there
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.240]   shopping for that, there you go. Now what I actually did now was I'm only going to show like the one
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.840]   size, the prices for the one size and if you want to know what the bigger sizes are for the you know
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.160]   bottles, just you know click on any one of these links, it'll take you right to the site.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.160]   But you know in order to show you the other oils that any of these guys are selling,
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.320]   I just kind of just put it out here in columns. So to make it really simple to see, oh, you know,
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.880]   who's selling, you know, how much do they sell their their olive oil for, right? And then do they
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.400]   sell other or do they sell other products like they sell the powder, oh, they sell avocado, coconut
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.520]   oil and hemp. And and what's kind of interesting is that there's been a new one. Almond has been
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:27.320]   added this year or this this month, I guess. But so now there's somebody selling all of Almond oil,
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.400]   C60 and Almond oil, which was new. There's also C60 in black seed oil. So that's new since the
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   last update. All right. Okay, and then of course there's the CBD, which is really interesting.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.080]   If you take a look at the CBD column, there's only one guy still doing it, you know, and it's
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.960]   kind of interesting how it just never really took off, but yeah, never did. There's only one person
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.760]   tinkering around. A lot of folks are doing obviously the avocado and the coconut seem to be the
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.200]   two big favorites and then the rest of them out here. So that's how you read this thing. So right
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.920]   now, just as as always, good and cheap at the at the very top in terms of the price, best price,
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:11.320]   you know, 400 milliliters all the way up to 108 dollars are the same bottle, not the same bottle,
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:18.760]   but you know, a bottle of 100 milliliter bottle of C60 in olive oil. It's almost like five times
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:27.000]   more. And that's it's an amazing this is an amazing spread for a product that's basically C60 powder
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.400]   stirred in olive oil. So there you go there. I did add for the United Kingdom. There's some
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.720]   great companies in there. Shout out to the C60 company. She's on the that's Rebecca in our
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.760]   chat room and she's really active in the chat room does a lot of great research and really smart
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:51.480]   lady to talk to if you have C60 questions and you live in the UK. So she's got her product out here
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:57.880]   now. And she's like 45 pounds sterling for 800 milliliter olive oil. And she's also selling the
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.680]   powder and oh, this one right here, whatever that is pumpkin seed oil. Pretty cool. All right,
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.720]   so you got some folks out there in the UK now dabbling around in different oils. And this is
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.120]   lowest to highest there. And then of course, you've got the Australian folks. We've got
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.200]   shout out to Margaret and for Vital Health. She's also on the chat room. Great contributor,
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:24.520]   love ya. And so she's selling a $75 Australian dollars for 100 milliliters olive oil. And then
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.240]   of course, you've got these other folks out there selling different types of oil. And then
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.600]   just a couple of other ones that I found. There's a couple in Canada, Canadian dollars. And then
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.680]   of course, there's this one in Switzerland that's been around for quite a while. And what their
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.240]   prices are right here. The one in the other Canada one is the hemp Canada. They don't actually have
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.360]   these guys around here at the bottom of the list. They don't have an olive oil, C60 olive oil product,
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:54.440]   okay. But they do have C60 in other oils. And so if we kind of just take a look at the very top
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:00.200]   of the list, the types of oils. And then you can see that there's avocado coconut and so forth
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.560]   for all these different types of oils that all the way up to CBD oil provided by these folks who
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.800]   decided not to do the olive oil thing and go straight into other oils, okay.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:17.080]   And so that's that group of folks. And the next thing I updated was the specialty products. And I
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:23.480]   want to kind of chad a little bit about specialty products. If you're new to C60 oils, this here is
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:29.240]   your buying guide. And depending on what country you live in, this is the cost. And these are all
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.680]   very reputable folks. And so you just feel free to, I know folks and like myself, I've tried five
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.760]   or six different brands just to try different brands, you know. So you can kind of look at
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.400]   what they sell. You can try different types of oils. I mean, so it's kind of cool. This is,
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.400]   you know, your shopping guide, if you're new to C60 or if you're a seller and you just really,
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.320]   really want to know what your competition is doing. Now, but in terms of the specialty products,
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:58.200]   one thing that a lot of folks that, you know, that are new to the C60 supplement idea don't
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.880]   realize that they're actual specialty products. And I kind of wanted to chat about that if you're
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.440]   new to this, just to make sure you're covering, you know, that you are aware that there are some
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.680]   specialty products. And so I'm going to just talk about these four because they're very unique.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:17.080]   And let's just pop in here. Now, this one right here, this is called live pet. And if you're
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:23.160]   part of our chat room, we have the telegram chat room is there's several different rooms. There's
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.360]   one for testimonials. There's one for just chatting about C60. And then there's one just talk about
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:34.200]   anything, you know, a lot of people like talking about cryptos or whatever. And so, but the one
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:40.680]   in testimonials, I just actually posted an updated video by live pet on a cat that was treated with
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:48.360]   C60, companion C60, and made a miraculous recovery. And it was a pretty amazing little testimonial.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:54.680]   So I, you know, I've had my dog on live pet. It does perk her up. It did it like, you know,
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:00.040]   eliminate cancer or anything. But it really is a very unique product. It's a special blended
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.320]   formula. So it's not quote in olive oil. It's a mix of different fatty acids that so they have
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:13.000]   their own proprietary blend. And they sell C60 special C60 oils for cats, dogs, and horses. So
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.640]   if you've got cats, doctor horses, and you want to give it a try, here is a very special product made
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:25.560]   just for animals by a very intelligent scientist at the live pet company. These are not your normal
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:31.640]   folks that are making C60. These guys have patents and stuff like that. The other one that's
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:37.640]   popped up on the radar just recently was the Live Longer Labs guys, the Phil Cottoliano and Max
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:46.600]   Champy. They were just recently on Sarah Westall, the YouTube, I guess commentary interview news
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:51.320]   channel thing that she runs. And very interesting. It was just like about a week ago that they were
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.600]   on her show and they were talking about their new product and the benefits of black seed oil
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   and what they're seeing from folks taking it. So it's kind of a totally new thing because
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:08.600]   first of all, no one had done black seed oil before now. And then also no one's ever stuck C60
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:14.200]   oil in a capsule. So it's pretty interesting. This is a new product on the market. I kind of did
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:22.360]   the math on this thing. There's about eight ounces of oil inside this jar of 180 capsules
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:30.120]   based on the size of these capsules being about a triple O capsule size which holds about 1.3 milliliters
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:36.920]   per capsule. I was just guessing based on what it looked like. And I'm also working on a video to
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:42.280]   replicate it. And so yes, there's about an eight ounces in there. And that's kind of how I, you know,
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:48.280]   I you could do a cost comparison with this guy. Now the the doses that they're saying on these
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:55.400]   capsules is three to five capsules a day, which will give you about, you know, what's that three
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:01.720]   to three times 1.3 or it's like four milliliters. It's like a teaspoon kind of thing. So it's not a
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:06.680]   lot of just oil, but it's it's around the same amount of dosage you would normally take where
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.000]   people are telling folks to take a teaspoon. You know, I look at it more like from a weight
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.760]   standpoint, like how how large are you and and take it for your weight,
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:19.320]   which is, you know, for a grown man, it's like a tablespoon a day, not a teaspoon teaspoons,
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:26.040]   like five milligrams or sorry, five milliliters, tablespoons, 15. So, you know, so they're all
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.800]   depends, but you know, that's how they're doing it. And there you go. That's real interesting,
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.040]   brand new on the market. The other thing that you might want to know about for the folks that don't
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:42.280]   is the the folks that own live pet actually started up a new product line called the C 360 health.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.880]   And what that product line is doing is now they're also the carbon 60 plus guys. But
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:52.200]   what's interesting is they created this these these two products and this product right here
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.480]   came out about maybe eight months ago or so. And I actually just pounded down a whole bottle of
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:04.040]   this over the month of January when I was doing my metoxy test. And you know, I like it. It was a
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:09.240]   really good product. It kept me going. And it's and again, it's not just olive oil. It's a it's a
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:17.160]   proprietary blend of oils. 95% of what's in the bottle is C 60 oil. And the other 5% are other
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:25.240]   anti aging and youthful type of supplements like carosene and systemic enzymes and things like that.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.960]   So it's a proprietary blend and they actually have, you know, a patent on this one. So it is pretty
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:35.240]   impressive. These guys work very closely with universities and and get patents and they're
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:39.720]   really serious about their stuff. So they've got one for men, one for women, and then they've got
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:45.640]   this hair growth activator, which is sort of taking the world by storm by it as people find out about
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:51.080]   it. You know, a lot of balding people would like to not be bald. So pretty interesting stuff. So
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:58.200]   Oh, yes, Sarah Ian or Ian Mitchell is the guy that behind all of this was also on Sarah
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.000]   Westall's show on YouTube. So if you're interested in listening to him talk about this stuff,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.360]   you know, go for it. Okay, so the other the fourth new product on the market that I wanted to share
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:15.480]   with you is Gresa's Carbon 60 now has a commercial concentrate. It's a two ounce bottle of commercial
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:22.200]   concentrate. So there's basically the way I look at the math on this is he's shoved in a gram of
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.800]   C 60 into this little two ounce bottle because if you take the two ounce bottle and you add 30 ounces
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:35.720]   of whatever oil you like and you basically mix it up, you will have one liter or one quart of C 60
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:42.200]   oil. Now, as you all know, I had an issue with this. So I have done an experiment where I've taken
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.480]   this product before the regular non concentrated product, but I took the regular product and I just
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:53.320]   added oil to it like like like this is supposed to be done. And I stirred it for two weeks,
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:59.560]   let it settle and I filtered it. And it came out as regular C 60 oil and it didn't bother me
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.880]   because I had filtered it. And so definitely it's an interesting idea because what I want to show
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:09.880]   you about this is the cost comes out now. These are the various costs for the live pet live longer
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:18.280]   labs, you know, that black seed oil, the the the C 60, I mean, sorry, the C 360 health products,
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:23.240]   85 dollars per eight ounces. But now of course, it's 225 for a little two ounce concentrate.
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:29.000]   But you know, when you take a look at that makes a whole court and if you're looking out and if
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.080]   you're out there shopping and you want to buy, let's say a court. So let's say a court of here's
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:41.880]   here's an example. Here's the purple power coconut oil. And if you go to this one website called
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:47.000]   vital vibe, it's the only place you could buy purple power in this size. You just pick one
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   coconut or avocado, let's say, let's just pick, you know, okay, let's go with avocado. And you
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:58.840]   say what size you go 32 ounces one court, right there, $700. So if you wanted to make a court or
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:08.440]   I'm sorry, buy a court from purple power or from vital vibe, you're going to pay $700 or you could
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:14.360]   go here. And for 225, you could add, you know, just add more oil to it and stir it up. And you've
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:21.960]   got a whole court. So 225 versus 700. Okay, you, you know, we like, we report you decide, right?
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.360]   Anyway, so that's something to think about. So that's that. Now the last thing here, I'm sorry,
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.320]   second of the last thing here is the raw C 60, as mentioned in the last update on the on the raw
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.960]   powder, this shortage is over, as I expected, early spring. Now the only problem is there's still two
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:43.480]   providers or merchants out there, manufacturers, I'm sorry, of the raw C 60 that they still have
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:49.160]   active wait lists. And so they're banging away on their wait list. I'm on both. And I have not heard,
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.480]   I've heard from them, but I have not received anything. I've not been told where I'm on the
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:58.440]   wait list. I sort of expect it's going to be a couple more months. But here's, here's the thing,
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:04.520]   you can wait and you're not impatient. And you have some money. They haven't updated their prices
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:11.720]   yet. Look at the prices. Everyone has gone from 220 all the way up here to like 339. Okay. And red
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.280]   lion hasn't updated their prices yet. They're still honoring the old price. They say that when
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.920]   they start producing it, because right now the reactors come online, they're putting out like
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:26.600]   99.5. And they're, you know, they're trying to perfect the quality. And then they're going to start
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.320]   putting out 99.99 and start selling that, harming shipping it, because that's what everybody bought.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:36.920]   So the waiting list is waiting for 99.99. But on the website, it's still really, really, really low.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:42.200]   So, you know, you're, you're smart, folks, if you have the time and money in patients,
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.680]   might want to consider going out there and putting yourself on that list at the old price before it
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.840]   goes up. Because it will go up within a few months and it's going to look like this more, you know,
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.480]   so that's a big difference. Anyway, so MTR again, they're on the waiting list. They said that their
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.160]   reactors would come on their new processes would come online in January and they started banging
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:05.320]   away on their wait list. So that's 195. Oh, by the way, it's one gram for 99.99 versus 99.95.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.400]   That's how the spread goes. And so this is what, this is the, this is the purity that these
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.800]   guys are selling, these are purity, these guys are selling. And so there you go. And so you just
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.800]   click on any one of these guys. And these guys, you'll end up on a wait list. But these other guys,
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.560]   you can just buy and they will ship it to you. But you can see where it is getting really pricey
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:29.800]   out there. So this is a pretty good idea at this point. So keep that in mind if you're out there on
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:36.120]   you're a make your own kind of person. So anyway, lastly, analytics on the C60 prices. I've been
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:42.040]   tracking this since I started in November 2017. I'm not, I tried to do like a scenario three months,
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:47.400]   not really consistent. But hey, you know, the average price of one ounce, and I'm just doing
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:52.840]   an apples to apples because I started this thing at one ounce, average price for one ounce of C60
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:59.160]   olive oil in the United States started out around 1795. It popped up a little bit right after that,
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:04.920]   pretty much due to a interview on Sarah Westall. She comes up a lot in this industry. And it was
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:10.520]   all the way up to 1890. I mean, in the beginning of January, it was very expensive to buy C60 oil
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:15.880]   directly. And this was what caused me and a lot of folks that I know to start making it ourselves.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.760]   And so as people more and more and more and more folks are making it and selling it,
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.200]   the prices have come down. And now what's interesting for you guys in the market
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:30.440]   is from May till February, you can see that the prices have stabilized. This seems to be
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:37.640]   the trough right here between 10 and $11 is going to be what the price going forward may be
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:42.360]   as the standard quote market price. So that's pretty interesting how for the last three,
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:48.280]   it's just really in this real really narrow channel in terms of prices. So it seems like the prices
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:53.240]   have really stabilized. The prices for Rossi 60 are a little, you know, Wild West right now,
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:58.680]   as you can see from 73 bucks to 339 for a gram. Obviously, it's different quality,
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:04.840]   but still that's that's that's a hell of a spread. That's 300% higher. So, you know, until that
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.600]   really, I mean, really, when you're looking at price fluctuations, you shouldn't have a
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:14.040]   variant of 300%. That means you have a very unstable and volatile marketplace. But now,
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:19.080]   you look at this right here, you have a very stabilized marketplace. The prices are remaining
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.800]   quite normal in terms of, you know, within the same trough. Anyway, so that's that.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.520]   Last thing I want to just make a point of and, you know, while this pricing guide is about buying
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:35.800]   C 60 oil, I am a proponent of making your own. It's so simple. And you know, a lot of folks in the
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:40.760]   beginning, when it was like this up here at 18 bucks, I used to read comment after comment after
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:46.520]   comment in YouTube videos about C 60 where people were just be like, I can't afford it. This is
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.440]   just one of those, you know, rich people things and that and just so many folks, especially the
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.040]   seniors, you know, they're on fixed incomes. They just, there's no way they could put out,
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.880]   you know, 50 bucks or a little tiny little bottle that'll last them a two weeks, you know. So,
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.920]   that's that was, you know, that's why I kind of got into the whole make it yourself. I wanted
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.000]   to teach people how to make it themselves. So they could, they could, you know, take this,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.520]   this incredible supplement. So here you go. So I just wanted to update the cost your own. So,
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.760]   if you needed to, if you wanted to make your own, you're just going to need a beaker, a stir, a
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:22.600]   filter rig and a vacuum pump. Okay, 86 bucks, you know, this is current right now on Amazon,
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.880]   87 bucks free shipping. Okay, that's all you would have to buy for equipment. That's it. And
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.680]   then let's say put that aside. And then you just get some olive oil. Okay, one liter of olive oil,
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.280]   get a gram, get the 220, because that's the only guy that's going to ship it to you. The lowest
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:41.480]   price right now is bucky labs 220. They will ship today. And so you buy that and boom,
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:47.480]   it's 241.99 for one liter of C 60 oil. And as you know, there's 33.18
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:54.120]   ounces per liter. And so it's going to come out to $7 and 16 cents per ounce. So look at that. That's
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:22:04.760]   1049, 716, you save 32%. Okay, now note back here, when C 60 raw C 60 powder was way cheaper.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:10.120]   I was, I think my first video where I made it, I think it only costs me $3.65
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:16.040]   an ounce to make it. And so it's like doubled. I mean, so the maker price has doubled. But right
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:22.760]   here, you're still saving 32%. And you know, if you take as much C 60 as I do and some other folks,
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.360]   where it's like me and my dog, and we're like grinding through like, you know, a bottle,
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:32.040]   easy, a week, you know, and you know, big bottles. And so you can still save a lot of money. And
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:37.160]   that's saving a lot of money. Really, really, really, really adds up over time. So anyway,
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:42.600]   that's it for the pricing guide update link under the description. Hope this was helpful to
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:50.120]   have a great day. Thanks for stopping by. Really, thank you. Thank you for being nice to me. And
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.600]   have a great day. Aloha.
