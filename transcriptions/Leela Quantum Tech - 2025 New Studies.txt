[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and this
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.640]   video is Philip and Von Holzendorfel Lele quantum tech discussing new studies that are coming out
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.040]   in 2025. We had a great chat last week about the new products coming out in 2025 and part of that
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.040]   chat. We covered some of the new studies. So if you wanted to hear about the new study on brain
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.880]   waves, we did discuss that in the 2025 new products video. And then the rest of our conversation
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.160]   as to what the new studies are and the studies that are underway for 2025 are going to be in this
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.400]   video. So without further ado, here's our discussion. Aloha. There's a there's a ton of research that
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.120]   is going to happen, you know, as always, I think there hasn't been a single year where we didn't
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:54.160]   have significant research. I, you know, there's the 2025 could be a breakthrough year in regards
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.440]   to that because some of the latest research in regards to yeah, several different topics
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:10.720]   may also get published even in respected journals. No, not that this is a big
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.120]   focus area for us because we actually really want to rather build the new and not
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.720]   kind of work with the old, if that makes sense. And I'm not the biggest fan of most of those
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.640]   journals frankly, but it still would be nice if it if it gets a little bit more into the mainstream
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.000]   because then just more people will hear about it and more people will be able to experience this
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.080]   also. And I think it's it's the time for that. No, that's not yeah. Okay, that's awesome. So that
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.480]   kind of leads into the next the issue here where are the next question I had for you. But did you
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.440]   want to just kind of just touch on those new studies that are coming out because you did explain
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.720]   the brainwave study pretty much in depth, that's going to be coming out later this month in January.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.560]   But what about like, you know, what are some of the highlights that you're really excited about
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.560]   in terms of the new studies coming out in 2025? Yeah, so with with the brainwave study,
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:21.040]   certainly it's the mitochondrial performance. We had these in vitro studies by the University
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.240]   of Tulsa that most people probably have heard of that that showed, you know, a significant
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:37.280]   acceleration in cell recovery and an increase in ATP production. Now then you always have naysayers
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.000]   right and those naysayers sometimes can get on your nerves really. But they they also
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.120]   provide a challenge right and and I take it as such. So then we had a couple people that said,
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.720]   yeah, I mean, that's amazing. But still that was just done with actual human cells not measured
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.320]   in a physical body. Now it's very difficult actually to measure it in an actual body, right? It's very
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.440]   difficult to do that. Now then we were introduced by a doctor to a company called MeScreen ME and
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:23.920]   then Screen and what why it seems that they're the most advanced in this field. And with actual
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:33.040]   blood tests, they can determine on an extremely granular level, how the mitochondria work, how
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.640]   they function, ATP production, they can measure lots of other markers, they can even measure the
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:48.000]   cell danger response, which is unheard of. And what does that mean? You know, for example,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.840]   you if you crank up ATP production too much and then it just does too much, you know,
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.440]   could may not be even good for the for the for the cells and for the body, right? There's there's
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:10.480]   always a is it's still good for the body, right? And so they have run a study with with the quantum
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:19.440]   upgrade and the results are absolutely remarkable, I must say. So there's a there's an increase in
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.520]   all markers and improvement, I should say improvement in all markers, because not all of them are
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:33.280]   increases, they're all improvements. And across the board, and yeah, it's it's quite phenomenal. And
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.920]   and so it shows it validates all these other ATP production studies. And it also shows that
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:48.480]   what is happening is is ideal for the human body. They were able to even see so after seven days,
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:56.320]   they saw significant improvements and so fast and rapid that that they were really surprised.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:05.120]   Then they saw over, you know, until the one month marker, they saw detox effects going on in the
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.680]   body, which is not a bad thing, right? That's actually quite a good thing. And they they said,
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.240]   well, like, so now is about the time where it should move into even better cell performance
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.880]   and in less detox effect. And that's exactly what happens. So then the three months test was done,
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.200]   and it confirmed exactly what what they suspected and what what we suspected. So it's it's quite
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:38.720]   phenomenal. That one will also be extended, actually, in terms of the sample size. And yeah,
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.800]   then then at some point, we'll be published. The other one was in regards to women's health. So
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.240]   I don't see this here on the list, but women's got published. Well, well,
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.080]   came out, it came out, but it's not on the site yet. So I did exactly yes, it's on the side. It
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.160]   will be published by that Institute Institute is called reputable health. They are specifically
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.240]   concerned about fertility of women, and they had reached out at some point. So now they tested
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.400]   a lot of different markers in regards to that. I think it was almost 30 women
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.840]   that were a part of the study and all the markers improved significantly across the board,
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.920]   including HRV, resting heart rate, and a lot of other markers. And they were so impressed at this
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.000]   Institute that now all of them there have the quantum upgrade. They didn't even ask us if they
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.560]   could get a disco encoder or something. They just bought it all. They just
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:47.760]   signed up right away. Exactly. And their CEO has become just a big fan. I met him in person at
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.880]   the last conference in Las Vegas, because he wanted to meet. He just said, it's just amazing
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:02.800]   what you guys have. So that study will also be broadened. I think we will have at some point
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:10.080]   over 100 women in the sample size, so that that should be quite positive. And yeah, those are the
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:18.560]   most exciting ones. Obviously, parasites is extremely exciting for the health of everyone.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:26.640]   And this spike protein hydrogel story is quite amazing as well. So all of those are interesting,
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.560]   but I think the most exciting for me right now is the brainwave study. And I tell you also why
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:39.040]   just because it's well, it's quite expensive to get such a high level EEG is done. But
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:46.000]   you can show to everyone very quickly how this works. And it's not that you need to
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.200]   take blood or find someone that has a dark field microscope and things like that.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.680]   It's about EEG. And even if there's at some point a high level doctor or someone that says,
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:06.160]   well, yeah, I don't know if this works. Well, go get tested. Then just see with your own eyes.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.360]   And I think this will be pretty eye opening for many.
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:15.600]   Yeah, no, it's unbelievable how many different studies are on the site now. And then all the
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.720]   different studies that are underway. And they're just all remarkable. So yeah, kudos to you for
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.760]   doing that. I mean, you're really moving the dial on science, not just running a company selling
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.120]   products and services. So yeah, it's amazing. It is amazing. And I'm, you know, and I'm the one that
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.680]   does these, that the study recap. So I try to really keep, you know, break it down and make it
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:43.440]   simple for everybody who doesn't like reading 35 pages of science talk. But yeah, okay, so no,
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.080]   those are great. So we got some definitely some great new studies are in the works and going to be
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.880]   published soon. And they're coming up.
