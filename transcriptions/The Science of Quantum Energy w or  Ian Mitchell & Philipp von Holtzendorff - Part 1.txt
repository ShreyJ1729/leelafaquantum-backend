[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video and this video is special.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.520]   We're going to talk about the science of quantum energy and this is a Tinker chat with
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.120]   I and Mitchell and Philip Von Holtzendorf.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.000]   So I just wanted to let you guys know if you don't know who these gentlemen are, I and
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.440]   Mitchell is the owner/operator wizard scientist.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.400]   He's an acclaimed scientist, most recently and currently in the C60 world, multiple patents
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.440]   to his name and he's just absolutely brilliant.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.040]   We've also got Philip Von Holtzendorf, who's the owner/operator of Leila Quantum Tech.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.520]   And so, and he is really an expert in the area of energy work, clairvoyance, and he's
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.240]   actually an actual shaman.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.040]   So what's really cool about this discussion today is we're going to be talking about
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.120]   the science of quantum energy.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.160]   We have a scientist, we have a shaman, and then I'll be facilitating the discussion with
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.080]   my perspectives as well.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.560]   So hey gentlemen, good morning and thanks for joining.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.560]   Are you okay?
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.560]   Hey Kay, happy to be here.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.560]   All right.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.680]   Hey Kay, thanks for the invite.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:19.360]   I think the next time we speak, guys, Philip, I'm going to take the role of shaman and you
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.600]   can go for scientists.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.920]   I think it might be interesting to see what each of us comes up with from the perspective
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.400]   of a different domain.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:36.800]   Oh, I'll be the physicist that just criticizes everything you both say.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.800]   I got him.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.800]   You know, it's really funny.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.000]   Actually, I was going through all these different videos to pull content for just talking points.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.800]   And I ran across one where I think it was Deepak Chopra was talking at a convention and
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.320]   a physicist came on, you know, they stand up and get the mic.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.160]   And so the physicists and Deepak are trying to, you know, are talking to each other.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.160]   And so the guy goes, you know, I don't understand, you know, he goes, I understand, well, this
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.360]   is his quote when Deepak was trying to explain quantum or basically bio field and quantum.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.440]   And the guy looks at him, this PhD guy's goes, looks right at Deepak and goes, you know,
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.240]   I know what all those words mean individually, but I don't get what you're saying the way
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.740]   you're putting together is really funny.
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.360]   And then so Deepak goes and actually says, you know, well, let's, you know, goes, well,
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.760]   lots of people will call this woo woo, but that's a cop out.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.080]   You know, just, it's like, you know, you just, you're just basically labeling it and throwing
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.080]   it off to the side.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.680]   But, you know, it's not woo woo.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.320]   And I think that's the first thing I want to say is that the idea of quantum energy as
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.560]   we are going to define it today is not woo woo.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.600]   So hey, let's jump in.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.920]   But yeah, definitely I definitely would love to hear you defend shamanism and then Philip
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.920]   defend science.
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.120]   That would, that would be great.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.320]   Okay, so the first point of the discussion that I want, I guess, you know, get you guys
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.320]   to kind of comment on is the idea here and this is the first thing anybody should understand
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.680]   about this topic is that there's no definition with the words that we're using.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.120]   In other words, there's no language.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.360]   I cannot find a language that encapsulates the concepts of what we're, what we're talking
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.080]   about and what anyone is talking about in this subject matter.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.080]   And so here's like, here's a little of the definition of quantum is, is this where you
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.080]   see on the screen?
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.080]   I won't read it.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.200]   But the concept is that, hey, the definition of quantum and the actual definition by, you
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.640]   know, websters or whomever of energy, none of these things apply to the concepts that
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.640]   we're describing.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.480]   And it's only the fact that we're, you know, we're using these words for the lack of words
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.480]   to use.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.760]   I mean, would you guys agree with that?
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760]   100%.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.720]   That's, that's the problem with this is in terms of conveying it to someone, you're dealing
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.280]   with things that are subtle and the degree of subtlety is something by virtue of the kind
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.600]   of topics that we're looking at for the purposes of saying like, we look quantum tech.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.200]   When I look at that, it is, it's daunting because the vernacular doesn't exist.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.480]   You're trying to, I mean, obviously the vernacular exists for quanta and descriptions of what
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.680]   that is, but it's really not appropriate because when you're trying to look at something from
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.040]   the standpoint of, okay, that's great.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.120]   What's the level of abstraction beyond that?
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.400]   Well, then you get to a place where things really do, you know, and I agree, woo, woo,
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.040]   woo is a cop out because as a scientist, you're supposed to go where there is a lack of understanding
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.880]   and trying to shine a light on it.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.880]   But it is.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.720]   Yeah, I have no words for a lot of the things.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.560]   And that's why I do a lot of these things via analogy is we can, we can understand in
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.160]   principle, but there, there are just simply some things that are beyond the component
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.400]   of doing it as a very definable test, like there's literally not a human alive probably
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.960]   that doesn't understand the concept of love in some form or fashion.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.880]   But, you know, show me the meter that's going to gauge that.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.160]   Yeah, yeah, I hear you yes.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.280]   So you know, and if you guys actually have a wine on the lavometer, let me know where
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.200]   I can buy one.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.600]   You know, okay, I'll work on that one.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.920]   So Philip, you know, I was thinking about when it comes to language, and I, yeah, I totally
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.920]   agree.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.160]   And, but you know, this whole thing about language and one of the thoughts that popped
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.240]   in my head last night when I was putting this deck together was, all right, here's
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.640]   the definitions, none of it applies, there's no words for this.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.840]   But then I also know for a fact, right, that when Europeans dominated or spread out across
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.240]   the planet and dominated all the indigenous cultures, they wiped out their cultures and
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.040]   language and religious practices and would dominate in all of that with their own.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:57.160]   And I'm wondering because of your shamanic background, if there exists words prior to
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:02.560]   the domination of the European culture, right, but for the first nations, people in the
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.800]   indigenous populations, are there words in that realm that really kind of define what
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.800]   this is?
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.040]   Is there like, is there a better language that we could be using instead of English?
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:22.920]   Well, I mean, I think, I think in Sanskrit, for example, an ancient language, there's,
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.960]   there's a lot of wisdom and understanding in it.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.000]   So I think that's a pretty good language to look at.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   And there's also some, you know, scriptures in that language that are, you know, interesting
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.760]   to look at from that standpoint, but I would 100% agree also with what Ayan said, the deep
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.080]   truth of creation just cannot be described with words.
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.160]   The infinite, basically, is what we cannot describe, we can, we can try and we can get
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:02.080]   near that, but it's not a concept that you, or it's, that truth cannot be explained with
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.680]   words in a way that everybody understands it, right?
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.560]   If it was so easy, then you could just write a few sentences and everybody would immediately
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.800]   get it, but it's something you actually need to experience.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:20.880]   So we're always in this stretch position in a way between, okay, what do we experience
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.760]   and how do we describe it, and that's kind of the trick here also, because, I mean,
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:35.360]   I think so many people now understand that that exists, that there's more than just this
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:42.160]   physical, material world that we're seeing with our own eyes, right, living in these extra
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:49.440]   dimensions of space and time, moving from spot A to spot B, and then, you know, time moves
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.880]   as we move along.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:59.800]   That is something that doesn't exist in the truth behind it, if you will, but how do you
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800]   explain it?
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.720]   So it is very difficult, and I think what we're doing today is we're going to try to
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:12.960]   get closer to it, and hopefully people can relate to that as we're trying to do that
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.960]   from a few different angles.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.560]   No, that, yeah, yeah, good, all right.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.800]   Well I was going to say, even if you pull back, I mean, because a lot of people approach
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.880]   this topic with trepidation, because, you know, it's the idea of spirituality or something
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:34.760]   larger than ourselves, and that, I think, just inherently makes people proceed with caution.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.320]   If you say the same thing about something that we've all done, you can understand how
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.120]   it's very difficult to convey even the most simple things, linguistically without the
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:50.160]   actual first-hand experience, you know, eating chocolate cake, you can write and read about
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.880]   eating chocolate cake all day long, but it's kind of a, it's an abstraction without actually
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.600]   really an experiential component, you're left dry, it doesn't mean much.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.560]   You know, you can say, oh, then you move your jaws, and your tongue moves through a semi-viscous,
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.680]   you know, solid at this percentage.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.440]   Yeah, those are all just descriptive terms, but really, when you eat the chocolate cake,
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.560]   you understand it firsthand, and that's something that we take for granted every day, a little
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.200]   simple item, when you start talking about something like this, like, what is the substrate
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   of reality?
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.960]   What transpires to actually make things manifest in a physical level?
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.400]   That's when I think you get met with a lot of fear about it, but the same thing applies
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.000]   just across all domains, really.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.440]   It's about the experience.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:42.280]   You have to experience it, you know, I mean, truly with quantum, the experience is one
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.280]   of the most critical components, because it actually changes the output of the entire
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.280]   thing.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.600]   Yeah, yep, yep, yep.
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:56.240]   I think a side note for all you folks out there, they, you know, if you really are having
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.480]   a hard time wrapping your head around it, just know that we're going to use the words
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:08.920]   quantum energy in a capacity that's not in the Western, you know, society's definitions.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.240]   And it's going to be kind of what we're going to try to do today is actually define that
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:18.600]   for everyone, what we mean by when we use the term quantum energy and not, and not in
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.960]   a woo-woo sense, but actual in a real sense, but just keep in mind that the current definitions
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.960]   don't apply.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.200]   So, yeah, thanks, gentlemen.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.000]   And so now the second concept that I want to throw at you is that, you know, for the
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.800]   last, I don't know, forever, I've been trying to explain stuff like this to people because
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.640]   I've been involved in biological magnetics.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.600]   And so when I talk like the work of Wilhelm Reich and, you know, his, his discovery, well,
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:47.280]   he would not discovery, but, you know, of Orgon and then, of course, being a Chikung guy,
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.760]   you know, I've been really involved with she and, you know, martial arts and, and then,
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.920]   of course, Prana and Mana.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.840]   But, you know, these are all the words that you hear come up when people talk about, you
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.120]   know, this etheric energy.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:03.880]   But even in these terminologies, it doesn't, I mean, is there is no one word?
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.680]   I mean, have you guys even come close to finding any one of these kinds of concepts, even being
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.960]   remotely close to it?
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:19.320]   Yeah, actually on the list here, but, but again, looking at these, yeah, some of these
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:24.720]   things are good approximations, but they're, they're only approximations within one segment.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.840]   They don't, each of these things means something differently and having had experiences and,
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.920]   and done, you know, experiments with some of them.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.560]   I mean, you're like zero point energy, that's pretty easy.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.840]   You can just look at something when it's at absolute zero or, or an approximation thereof,
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.920]   and you note that things are still moving.
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.600]   Well, there, there you go.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:50.560]   That's, that's a legit and testable phenomenon, um, scalar energy, less so, organ, less so,
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.080]   she and key, anybody who's ever done a bit of martial arts or been around somebody who's,
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:00.560]   um, you know, a, a practitioner, Chikung, unless you're absolutely living in a bubble,
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.520]   you can feel the actual impact of that on your physiology.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.520]   Uh, same thing with, with Prana.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:13.480]   Um, personally, I really haven't dealt with mana, but you know, those things are, again,
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.280]   the reason they have validity to me is because they're experiential.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.120]   And once you do it, unless you want to stick your head in the sand and be kind of the,
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.160]   the ostrich scientist, you have to realize that there are things that you're going to
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.720]   experience that we just don't have clinically descriptive words or academically descriptive
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.720]   words for.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.480]   Um, you know, zero point energy is a good one because you can verify that, you know, we
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.560]   know it exists, uh, spooky action into distance.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.280]   We know that happens because we were able to test things, uh, three years ago, a Japanese
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.760]   research team tested quantum entanglement and was able to verify that the, the effects
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.120]   were happening at, uh, 10,000 times faster than the speed of light.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.480]   And that's, that's pretty profound.
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:59.920]   You know, that's, uh, by common thought in the sciences, that wasn't supposed to happen,
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.680]   but it, but it obviously did.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.840]   Um, so, you know, the doorway is there.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.960]   It's just a matter of can you look through it.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.720]   So yeah, these terms, they're impactful, but to me, they're all subtle flavors of it
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:16.840]   because, you know, my interpretation of scalar is differently than organ because, uh, they
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.840]   just are.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:21.400]   And you know, my experience with key is different than my experience with Prana.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.400]   Totally.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.760]   So everybody is to like, you know, like dabbling, like you just said, you had a really good point.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.760]   These are all flavors.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.000]   And I think to understand what we mean by quantum energy is to understand that these
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.600]   words all touch it.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.640]   They're all different flavors of it, but they're not, they're not exactly what it is, but they
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.640]   all are very close.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.760]   And then so fill up from like, from your background, you know, I mean, you are actually, I think
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.800]   you, you teach Kundalini, a yoga and all these different kinds of things.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:55.920]   And so you're super close to this, is anything along those lines, like what would you say
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:01.360]   is the closest to quantum, the word quantum energy as we're trying to use it in, in that
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.360]   row for you?
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.160]   I mean, what would you say is the closest thing to it?
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.560]   It's a great question.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:16.560]   And one thing I tell people is that, you know, we breathe air here on earth to, to be alive.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:23.440]   We drink water so that we can function and then, you know, while for some people on earth
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.680]   is actually not needed to eat food, you know, most people eat food and also need to eat
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.000]   food in order to be alive.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.280]   But that's what most people talk about.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:42.480]   And people forget that we actually also need the source of energy to actually function
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.600]   because without that energy, we wouldn't exist either.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:48.440]   So it is absolutely vital.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.560]   And one could argue that's more important than food.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:15:02.360]   And so you can do martial arts, yoga, various practices of yoga, Tai Chi, et cetera, in
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:07.440]   order to increase your life force energy within you.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.400]   The same actually with Prana does the very same thing.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.440]   So Kundalini actually includes a lot of breath work and it's absolutely fantastic.
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:21.640]   And you can increase the life force energy within you knowingly and you can feel it while
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:27.000]   you're doing it already, that you're pumping yourself up basically with that energy.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.840]   You have more energy available.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:39.680]   Now the technology that we've created together with Roman actually provides that energy as
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:46.920]   well without you having to do these things doesn't mean it's not beneficial to also do
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.920]   yoga.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:53.640]   Actually, it's amazing if you do it in addition and you get way further, but there's a source
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:58.600]   of that energy that you can leverage to increase your life force energy.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:07.040]   So it's sort of a source energy that we need to exist and that helps us to be physically
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:13.840]   in good shape and also helps our energetic system.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.920]   That's what I would say to this.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.440]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.440]   I agree with both of you.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:25.580]   I think my own personal experience is practicing Chikong and feeling something that's outside
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.200]   of me and also inside.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.200]   Just you feel it.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.480]   You're right, I mean, I think that's the thing we should make it like mandatory classes
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:39.100]   for college students to have to explore these realms because that way they could balance
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.400]   their academia with, I would say, reality.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.720]   This is the true reality of our existence because if you feel it, there's no denying
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.720]   it anymore.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:54.240]   I mean, to sit there and move very slowly and then break out into a sweat and just be wiped
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.480]   out or charged up actually physically challenged.
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:06.480]   But I mean, that Chikong is an amazing practice because there's this energy that comes into
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.480]   you, right?
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.600]   And then the thing about scale, I don't know if you know Dr. Jerry Tenet, but he's coming
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:17.560]   out a new book where he's kind of basically going to be talking about how scalar energy
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:24.600]   is the energy of our DNA and the inner cellular energy that kind of pulls it all together
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.600]   in addition to his healing with voltage work, he's doing research on the idea of scalar
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.200]   and that's his theory, so his new book is coming out all about scalar as it relates
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.680]   to biochemical and healing with voltage kind of work.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.480]   So I'm looking forward to reading that book.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.640]   So all of these different energies, obviously, they all tie together to help on the definition
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.320]   of what quantum energy is.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.840]   So next talking point I want to throw out you guys and this is to everybody out there.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:57.480]   And a lot of folks that maybe didn't pay attention to science in school, but another
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:03.440]   talking point that we want to throw out in our definition or discussing of the science
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:09.600]   of quantum energy is the idea that there is this energy.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.560]   And for folks that deny that there's an energy, this is my talking point that I would like
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.680]   to or maybe they don't understand it, but the point I want to make and gentlemen, if
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:24.520]   you could chime in, is that from a very, very down to the atomic level, we know scientists
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:30.560]   know that, you know, that we have basic electrons, neutrons, protons, and there's a nucleus of
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.200]   an atom, there's electrons that are flying around as a diagram to fix.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.560]   And there's this movement and in order to have movement, you have to have energy.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.840]   And so there's the concept that here, first of all, there's a space between all of these
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:47.000]   different particles and so there's a concept here like, okay, is anything truly solid if
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.960]   even down to our atomic structure of our bodies, there's space in between, so there's space
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.960]   between everything.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.560]   So, you know, there's a whole concept there about being solid, but the point I'm trying
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.280]   to make is about energy.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.640]   There's energy that's moving all of these particles around and with movement comes frequency
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.640]   down to the very, and this is where we talk about quantum, quantum is this, you know,
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:12.120]   the smallest particle you could find and even within this nucleus, they're smaller and smaller
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.480]   and smaller particles.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.520]   And then when you look at the galactic, you know, you look at the universe, you see that
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:23.880]   same idea of not only movement, but you can see where it's everything's still spinning.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.880]   But there's also movement and where is that movement and how is that movement, you know,
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.600]   people can call it gravity, but that's not, you know, that gravity doesn't truly play
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.120]   if you get into the deep end of the pool here.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.800]   But the idea though is that the galaxy, everything's moving, every single thing down
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:44.160]   to the tiniest atomic, subatomic particle is moving all the way up to entire galaxies
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:50.180]   and everything floating around in the universe is moving and what causes movement, that energy.
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:55.560]   So gentlemen, would you think that quote, that energy kind of falls into the definition
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.760]   of quantum energy?
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:04.640]   Yes, I will, I will go on record is saying yes, it does.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:09.100]   And I think that's part of the reason that even when, by calculations, molecular motion
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:16.400]   should cease and subatomic motion should cease at absolute zero, it doesn't.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:22.560]   Because it has the appearance, at least in my studies, it has the appearance that all
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.720]   motion in the universe is spiral in nature.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.960]   Both on the subatomic and the, you know, the cosmic scales and intergalactic scales, everything
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.480]   seems to be moving in a sort of spiral motion.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:42.640]   And personally, my money is on the concept that the inherent power that keeps all of
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:48.640]   these things moving is that it's something that's, you know, a little indefinable that's
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:54.200]   beyond beyond the level of where we're at technologically.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:59.560]   I would also say that I think in time will probably approximate it more closely.
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:04.560]   But I, I really, again, I really don't know that we'll ever actually be able to look at
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.560]   it perfectly.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.920]   I don't know if you guys are familiar with the, the story flat landers.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.160]   Have you guys ever heard that?
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.880]   It's a little short story, but it's basically it's a sphere, a three dimensional sphere
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.720]   finds its way into a two dimensional land.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:25.560]   And it's trying to explain to the two dimensional creatures what it is.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:30.160]   And they can't experience it in its own nature of three dimensions.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:35.880]   So they can only understand it by abstractions based on their perception of reality.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:41.920]   So in, in similarly, when we are a subset of something, I think we can come up with terminology
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.720]   and try and get a good grasp of it based on, you know, looking at things and coming up
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.920]   with analogies to, to understand conceptually.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.880]   But I don't think shy of having a direct interaction and a direct experience of something
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.360]   like that, I don't think you'll ever peg it down.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.120]   I think that's an amazing example, actually, because that's, that's exactly the situation
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.800]   that we're as humans in, right?
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:17.360]   Because we, we can observe easily, you know, the, the dimensions that we witnessed here
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.240]   in the physical world, right?
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:25.840]   That's three dimensional for us and that's, that's very easy and everybody gets to observe
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:26.840]   that.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.160]   But we're way more than just that.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.400]   And that goes really into higher dimensions.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:40.680]   And it's, if you're, if you, if you don't have a conscious view or a conscious experience
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:49.240]   of those dimensions beyond, you're, you're going to have a very hard time in understanding
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.160]   that no matter how it is explained.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:58.680]   Now if your intention is to understand that and maybe you're working on becoming more
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:06.200]   transparent and getting there through meditation, other practices, through, you know, accumulating
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:12.040]   knowledge, et cetera, then you will start to understand that concept, but you will never
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:18.720]   fully understand until you are actually consciously experiencing some of these things.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:25.000]   So one, one thing I might interject there, Phillip, with regard to your particular technology
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.520]   that you and Roman have, you know, this is certainly not a, not a plug for it, but it's
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.880]   just, it's my own unabridged experience with this.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.360]   And you know, just I'll tell you what I've experienced.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.240]   One of the guys that works for me in, in playing with this, you know, I have a Geiger
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.160]   counters and we've tested, tested the block for radiation, can't find any gamma emissions
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:51.720]   or anything, you know, no beta or anything like that, magnetically it doesn't seem to
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:56.680]   do anything electrically, it's static, other than just maybe the spattering of things that
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.960]   would come about from interaction with ions in the air.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.880]   But I can tell you matter of fact, Lee, the one fell in the lab who has a very pronounced
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:12.160]   histamine reaction, he doesn't have a histamine reaction to foods that he normally does if
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:19.600]   we put them in the block, which I got to tell you from the standpoint of just seeing something
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:25.080]   that's repeatable over and over without really being able to put the terminology around it,
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.520]   it does flummox me a little bit because I can see it, I can repeat it, I can get the
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:35.440]   same data over and over, but I genuinely have no terminology that I can wrap around it and
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.880]   say it is this.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.640]   And that's part of the reason I'm so open to doing these sorts of things is because when
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.000]   you're able to repeat the experiment and get the same result every single time, there's
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.480]   something of note there, we just haven't figured out what it is and unfortunately, I do really
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.600]   believe that we may never be able to peg an it down on this, we might just be able to
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.400]   say, oh, it's this thing that exists outside of our particular confines of, you know, three
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.880]   dimensions and the arrow of time moving in one direction.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.560]   Oh, yeah, that's amazing.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.520]   But you know, you're right, you're right, there's that causality, right?
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:21.260]   But you know, so the definition of quantum energy as we are trying to define as multiple
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:29.520]   flavors and this molecular and galactic energy is just one of the flavors, but it's not the
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.400]   energy we're talking about, it's just, it's part of it.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.520]   I think it's kind of like this framework, I guess is the best word for it.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:41.440]   I'd like to throw another talking point at you guys, it's a four-minute video by Bruce
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:46.200]   Limpton and in all of my like, you know, just kind of like my background search for content
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:51.880]   for our discussion, I found this video to be just an amazing because he brings up a metaphor
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:59.160]   of a television that truly defines what, you know, like that, that first of all, that
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:06.360]   the energy, it's another definition of energy, but it's like a definition that I'll let him
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.360]   explain.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.800]   I'd to interpret it as consciousness, but let's go ahead and if you don't mind, let
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.840]   me go ahead and play that for you guys and then I'd love to hear your, your, your interpretation
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.920]   and your feedback on that.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.920]   So here we go.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.920]   He's ever wondered if there's anything more to human than this physical body that we have.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.160]   Well, it's really interesting because when we go back in history, they talk about something
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.040]   called spirit and energy and a new visible force that seems to be controlling who and
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.080]   what we really are.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:38.280]   Quantum physics emphasized that the universe is not really split into two realms, a material
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.640]   realm and an energetic realm.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.800]   Quantum physics reveals that everything is made out of energy.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:49.480]   What we perceive as matter is actually an illusion of energy and light that there is
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.480]   nothing physical.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.640]   You know, what do you mean?
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.640]   I say, well, first of all, very simple fact.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:59.280]   When physicists started to take the atom apart and find there were things inside such as
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.520]   protons, neutrons and electrons, then they say, yeah, but what are those things made
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.520]   out of?
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.840]   Then they got down to smaller things like parks and I say, yeah, but what were they
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:13.320]   made out of and ultimately what physicists recognized was at the fundamental pour of
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.120]   an atom, there was nothing material at all.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.920]   It's an energy vortex.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:23.920]   It's a powerful energy field and that all atoms are these energy fields and the significance
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:29.560]   about that is, well, atoms make up humans, so by definition, we perceive ourselves as
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:34.400]   physical structures but according to quantum physics, we're energy fortices.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:39.760]   Imagine a cell as a television set and that the environmental signal like a broadcast
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:45.440]   is being picked up by the antennas on that television set and therefore, the cell responds
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.440]   to that broadcast.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.900]   Well, guess what?
[00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.680]   Everyone has a different set of antennas, so by definition, everyone is receiving a different
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:59.440]   broadcast field, yeah, that's what physicists refer to as the energy in which we live.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:04.960]   So all of us are in a field, but each one of us actually receives a very precise and
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.520]   specific part of that field different than everybody else.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.800]   No two people share the same self-receptors.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.520]   That's why we just can't exchange cells, organs and tissues with each other.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.240]   Now comes an interesting part.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.440]   If the cell is like a television receiving a broadcast, then consider this, what happens
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.680]   if you're watching your TV and it breaks?
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.080]   We say the TV is dead.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.160]   I go, yeah.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.640]   But now the question is, yes, the TV just died, but is the broadcast still there that
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.640]   I was watching?
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.880]   The answer, of course, is still there.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.200]   The television's gone.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.200]   The broadcast is present.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:45.580]   I said, would you know, one way of knowing, get another TV set, plug it in, turn it on,
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.240]   and tune it to the right station and the show was back on air?
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.800]   Well this would apply directly to humans as well.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.100]   I have an identity due to a set of receptors receiving an environmental signal.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:02.060]   If I die, I have no more reception and therefore my broadcast exists, but there's no TV to
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.100]   express it.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:09.700]   If an embryo shows up in the future with the same set of self-receptors that I have, well
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:16.860]   then guess what, I'm back online in a different TV, does it have to be a male or female TV?
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.260]   Nope, that's the TV.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:24.600]   Well, how about, is it black, white, brown, red, yellow, that's the TV, that's not who
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.600]   you are?
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.140]   You are the broadcast.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:33.540]   Lastly, it's important to know that the character that you express in this life is actually
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:38.740]   sent back to your source because your brain is not keeping your consciousness in your
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:45.420]   head because magnetoencephalographs, unlike electroencephalographs, magnetoencephalographs
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:51.820]   read your brain function, but the probes don't even touch your head, they're very important
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.740]   concept right here.
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:30:00.020]   Your thoughts are not containing your head, they're broadcast into the field, and as Einstein
[00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:08.060]   emphasized, the field is the sole governing agency of the particle matter, and then we
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:13.460]   put all of this together and says, your biology is an expression of this matter, but it's
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:20.460]   actually shaped by the field, a field that exists whether you're here or not, and then
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:27.380]   all of a sudden the ancient story of spirituality now conforms to the modern day science of quantum
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.380]   physics.
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:34.660]   You're a field, you're a spirit, you're more than this, I'm going to understand that.
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.500]   It is the first step towards your personal empowerment.
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.700]   What do you guys think of that one?
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.140]   I'm inclined to clap.
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.900]   That was fantastic.
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.220]   Isn't that very well said?
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:31:00.340]   Best explanations of energy, or in my mind, the quantum energy, the way we're using those
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.820]   words, I still hate the words because they don't mean what they mean, but just the way
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:07.380]   we're using it, I think that's a perfect example.
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.660]   Everything is energy, right?
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.500]   But yeah, it's just so what do you think?
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.500]   I mean, Philip...
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:16.860]   Well, I'll jump in with something that comes to mind.
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:22.900]   One thing is, I'm sure both of you guys are familiar with dimethyl-triptamine DMT, and
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:30.340]   we produce DMT in our brain via pineal excretion and a transformation from melatonin, but we
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:39.220]   produce DMT, but when you take pure DMT, most people have an experience that's similar.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:44.500]   People see the same sorts of things routinely, and the interesting thing about DMT is that
[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.060]   intercalates into your DNA, right?
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:53.420]   And as we know from De Broglie's Handy-Dandy equations in 1924, anytime you change the
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:58.060]   mass of something like you change its wavelength, right, or it's tuning.
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:05.940]   And so you adjust to follow Lipton's analogy there, you adjust the tuning on the TV, so
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.380]   you're able to tune in to things that you wouldn't normally be able to see.
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.620]   And I really think that the reason for that is, if I were designing a universe, I would
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:19.540]   want to be very efficient, and I certainly wouldn't waste anything, and seemingly the
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:25.060]   easiest way to do that is to overlap a whole host of realities in a planar fashion and
[00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:29.900]   just separate them by very small nudges and frequency, the same way that you would do
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:35.900]   with three-phase electricity, right, and you have the phases running counter to one another,
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.740]   and so they don't impact one another.
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:41.820]   They all exist, but they don't interact in the same way because they're slightly out
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:47.060]   of phase, and I think that the same thing happens with consciousness, right?
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:51.980]   Our consciousness is phased in and tuned in for a particular reality, and some things
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:58.340]   like shamanic experiences and feel free to correct me if I'm speaking out of turn, but
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:03.340]   from my own experience and my own research, when people are experiencing altered states,
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:09.100]   I think they're subtly adjusting their tuning so that they're able to perceive from a source
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:14.220]   that's far larger than they normally can, and the other thing that's probably the one
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:20.060]   point of this that I personally would like to drive home is, if you think there's any
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:26.220]   validity to that and I personally do, the idea that your thoughts don't occur in your head
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:30.700]   doesn't shock me because nature is very efficient, it's certainly going to figure out how to
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:36.220]   store things on the cloud in lieu of storing things on a body, because it's not subject
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:40.740]   to the same processes that can degrade the signal.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:47.060]   That being said, if we're all connected, I would just like to point out be nice, be
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:52.940]   kind, because those ways propagate throughout the whole of reality, so whatever interaction
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.900]   you have on a small scale, that'll impact everybody everywhere.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.940]   So, just as a quick aside, no.
[00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:00.940]   Philip?
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:08.060]   Absolutely, yeah, fantastic, and that's also a great explanation, and so I can just second
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:14.020]   that in terms of the tuning, and that's what you find, for example, if we look at someone
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:28.020]   like Roman who can tune into a lot more breadth and frequencies than the normal human being,
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:37.940]   where that spectrum may be very, very narrow, his is extremely broad on multiple levels,
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:44.540]   and yeah, so there are things that some people just can't observe because they're just not
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:48.220]   there yet, and other people can.
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:54.060]   So yeah, I can absolutely 100% agree with everything that I'm just said.
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.060]   Cool.
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:59.960]   So I want to add one more talking point, and I kind of just do a general summary, just
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:06.020]   trying to define the phrase quantum energy, and then that is a quote by Einstein, and
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:10.660]   it's in German, so Philip, let me know if, or actually, since you've been practicing
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:16.820]   German rap, maybe, and you could kind of correct me if I pronounced it correctly, so
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.020]   I've been practicing.
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:24.740]   So spool cough, fun work on, is that close?
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:30.180]   Spool cough, fan vocal, fan work, that's fan vocal.
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:36.000]   Okay, but the whole idea, though, and for you guys at home, is that Einstein, once
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.980]   wrote a letter to a friend of his, and he just basically said, I cannot seriously believe
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.700]   in it, and he was talking about the statistical approach to quantum mechanics, okay?
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.860]   And he said, I cannot seriously believe in it, because the theory cannot be reconciled
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:53.580]   with the idea that physics should represent a reality in time and space free from, free
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:58.460]   from spooky action at a difference, which actually translated with this spool cough
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:04.220]   and free work on, which at the time meant spooky or ghostly.
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.480]   So there's really, there's no, you know, the, so the spooky, the term spooky didn't really
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.880]   apply back then.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.280]   It was this other word that was used again here, we're talking about language, right?
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:19.800]   But what this point makes is that Einstein said that the energy of our reality is independent
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.680]   of space and time, that there's something else there, but it's independent of space
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:24.840]   and time.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.440]   We know that it's broadcasted.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:32.560]   So if it's broadcasted and it exists because we wouldn't exist without it, and it's free
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:38.100]   from space and time, then the whole point of my trying to make a definition of our use
[00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.700]   of quantum energy.
[00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:44.860]   And if you've noticed by now, is that I'm trying to define it or help people understand
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:51.160]   it by explaining what it is not, and also explaining what it might be.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.940]   But to actually give you words for it is not possible.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:57.100]   But I just wanted to share all the different concepts of the word.
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:01.320]   So I mean, you know, I, and you'd mentioned spooky at a distance before, and that scientists
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.460]   have actually mentioned it, right?
[00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.460]   So yeah, they have.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:09.520]   They clocked it a few years ago, and it was, you know, happening at, if memory serves,
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:14.400]   and I'm pretty sure it does here, 10,000 times the speed of light.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.360]   And that's, that's pretty quick for all of you playing along on the home version of
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.360]   the game.
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.040]   Yeah, 10,000 times the speed of light is rather rapid.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:27.520]   And I think, and it was actually, I think in the paper, and I'd have to look, I think
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.920]   it was actually greater than 10,000 times the speed of light.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.240]   So you know, you can look at that and say, yeah, that's kind of quick.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:40.080]   You know, you shouldn't be able to materially move anything like that.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:44.000]   So it's obvious that some things are just free of the connection.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.880]   And part of that is, you know, in Einstein, I think it was probably very difficult for
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.600]   him to try and believe in something that you can't really reconcile with numbers.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:59.160]   I mean, hats off to I mean, kudos for, for, for acquiescing to the idea that some things
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:06.600]   are just beyond, beyond what you can discern and drill down with numbers, because I just
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.720]   don't think it's possible.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:12.760]   I mean, we are effectively locked in the confines of this reality, and it's hard to get out
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.760]   of that.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.800]   So I mean, yeah, I totally agree.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:20.720]   I mean, and then so Phillips, so here's the idea, right?
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:27.080]   Or quantum energy in our definition is like, is like somewhat of a conscious slash life
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.520]   force energy that brings forth life and consciousness.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.520]   Right.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.360]   I mean, I think we can all agree on that one.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:38.360]   And then the, the, the attributes of this energy is that it is independent of space and
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   time.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.800]   And so that then brings forces idea here of quantum entanglement, which has been proven
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.200]   in a scientific academic world.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:51.720]   So could you touch on the idea of this idea, you know, of the energy being free of space
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:57.960]   and time in, in the clairvoyant world, which especially like with the way that, you know,
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:03.400]   some of your devices are working now, where you could literally use a device, right?
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.000]   Or use an, or actually someone like Roman, I mean, Roman did something really wild in
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   a webinar.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.680]   I was in a few months ago with the EMF thing, you know, where he basically put a frequency
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:19.600]   onto a piece of metal in my hands, you know, 5,000 miles away.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:21.160]   It was just amazing.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.640]   But you know, that whole idea of space and time, not being relevant, but the ability
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:29.200]   to, to move that energy anywhere, anytime.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.160]   So I mean, in your world, I mean, well, how would, you know, I mean, what do you see,
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.720]   I mean, as, as, as this happening and what are your thoughts on that?
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.720]   Yes.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.720]   Absolutely.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:45.160]   Definitely must agree with that from multiple angles, because first of all, through just
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:50.720]   energy work that Roman does, or that crew, or I do, it indeed doesn't matter at all
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:57.080]   whether someone sits in Europe right now and the other person is in South America.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:03.280]   Distance does not matter, and we can see instant changes, instant effects.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.100]   And that is also what, what happened there with, with, with that card.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:14.420]   Now it also happens with the quantum block and the infinity block, for example, because
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:19.920]   that is not just a quantum energy field, it's an actual multi dimensional quantum energy
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.920]   space.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:25.060]   And there's, there's quite a difference in that because you can charge an object with
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:31.060]   quantum energy and then it transmits that, but it's, it's just solely a quantum energy
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:32.060]   field.
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:42.900]   You know, it has a whole lot less intelligence or conscious quantum consciousness levels.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:48.900]   So it's a, that's a very hard topic to discuss scientifically, but that's the way it is.
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:53.100]   And I'm sure we'll at some point arrive, maybe in the year when we talk about that, we can
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.460]   also expand on that.
[00:40:55.460 --> 00:41:04.140]   But if I put a picture in the quantum block or an infinity block of someone that's 10,000
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:15.660]   miles away, it, it has a measurable effect on the bio system of that person.
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:21.820]   And it doesn't matter if that person is just a mile away here as a neighbor or five or
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:27.380]   10,000 miles away, there's zero difference in that regard.
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:35.900]   And time is something, it's a little bit harder to explain and wrap our minds around.
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:43.300]   I think in this standpoint, and I don't even know how to explain that well, but I can share
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:52.660]   something that I've just heard about a week ago from a customer actually, and she has
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:42:01.300]   a daughter that has since her very young age as a little child has been in quite deep depression
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:07.860]   already as a pretty young girl, she was sometimes for a whole year, would just always just go
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:13.060]   back in her room and just cry, like for hours, it's like almost unimaginable anyway.
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:20.140]   So then there's nothing that they could ever do, and that mother is actually also an alternative
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.140]   health practitioner.
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:27.180]   So they tried lots of different things, but they had to end up really with a hotter medication
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:34.740]   and all of that just because that was the only way that would just help that daughter.
[00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:40.700]   And that daughter is now, I don't know, in the 40s, and nothing ever helped.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:45.820]   Then that mother started to have that impulse, and I actually wanted to react to that because
[00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:52.980]   I had said that he wouldn't be surprised if thoughts are not coming from the brain.
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:43:00.620]   I would say I'm actually differentiating because yeah, we can have thoughts in our brain, but
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:06.880]   you know where we get our impulses from, our ideas or all of that, which is way broader
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:11.220]   than just like a specific thought, like I'm going to think about how I'm going to cut
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.720]   that lemon, that is brain work for me.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:20.520]   But if I get a real impulse on something that's so much deeper, that's coming from a completely
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.520]   different level.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:29.980]   Anyway, going to that woman, that mother, she had that impulse to actually, when that
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:35.780]   her girl started to have all these issues that was at a very, very young age, she thought
[00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:44.060]   okay, so what if I take pictures off my daughter from that time where all this started to
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:52.900]   happen and occur, because there were instances that started to occur and then she reacted
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.780]   in a very depressive way.
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:44:02.180]   So she took those pictures and put those into the infinity blog, not altogether, she started
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:10.300]   to work with the youngest basically, and then noticed already after a week differences,
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:14.940]   her daughter did not know that she was doing that, and her daughter, they live in different
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:18.460]   continents actually.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:22.500]   And then she moved on to the next, like I don't know, I don't know the details, but
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:27.500]   maybe it was a picture of that girl, how she was two or three months older.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:33.980]   And so she worked her way through that and things happen that have never happened in
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:39.460]   that girl's life before, things have healed that have never been healed before, and she's
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:46.140]   like a completely different person in a positive way, connected to herself, a lot of different
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:45:00.180]   issues and behavior issues, depressive behavior and all that have changed in a really, really
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.860]   dramatic and significant way.
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:07.900]   So I don't know, I think this is a great example of what's possible.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:12.980]   I don't really know how that relates to time, because it's still from my perspective that
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:21.380]   healing still happened today, but it's taking like an energy of something that happened
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:28.660]   maybe 35, 38, 40 years ago, and it's fixing that.
[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:34.700]   So yeah, I just felt like sharing this story because I was so touched by it, and I feel
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.380]   it explains a little bit of this concept.
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:45.300]   Oh, that's an amazing, you know, that kind of ties to EFT or German new medicine, and
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:52.420]   even the tenant where they talk, all of these guys talk about how emotion and trauma gets
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.420]   trapped in the body.
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:46:01.460]   The science guys think it gets trapped in magnetic fields, the acupuncture folks or it
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:06.720]   gets trapped in your energy fields and so forth, but the concept of that emotion and
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.860]   all that baggage that we carry with us all through our lives are trapped and they actually
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:15.900]   cause physical maladies, that's German new medicine, right?
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.340]   And if you treat the emotion, you release, you release the problem and then you can finally
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.380]   heal the problem.
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:25.980]   So I think that's probably what's going on is that the healing and the wellness of the
[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:31.700]   life force source energy that's coming from this block, right, is that it's actually going
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:38.840]   to her in this time, but then releasing that trauma that she's holding on to from the
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:44.200]   past, right, because it's directly tied to that because of the picture.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:46.200]   And then of course, then allows her to heal it.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.200]   So that's my theory.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.800]   I mean, would you, would you, or Phillip, you guys think that's close?
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:59.160]   No, I actually, have you ever seen the research on the patients with sepsis, they had over
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:04.540]   3,000 patients with sepsis in a hospital, university hospital, and they, they separated
[00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:10.720]   them into two groups and one group was prayed, you know, they separated the files and then
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:15.620]   they prayed on one group and they found that there was a statistical, a very definitive
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:21.560]   and clear statistical correlation with benefits coming to the group that had received the,
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:28.080]   the prayer, which, you know, as a scientist, it sounds not so much to me because I've looked
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:31.920]   at this a lot, but at the outset, it would sound a little peculiar, but the thing that
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:37.640]   really was difficult for me to route my brain around was that, you know, the, the effects
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:43.280]   of their, you know, intercessory prayer were all retroactive.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:51.440]   They did this on patients that had had their sepsis, I think a decade earlier, you know,
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:56.360]   and that's, that's kind of interesting because they got a very clear statistical analysis
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:01.440]   and, and it, it, it showed very clearly that there was an effect, but it was an effect
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.520]   that was devoid of temporality.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:10.840]   It wasn't contingent on linear time and that's a, it is as just as a person who's trapped
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:16.920]   in linear time, it's very difficult to break the construct and say, oh, I can do something
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:21.520]   today in effect and outcome tomorrow because it, it seems to deviate from the concept of
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:27.600]   causality, which the more and more I, I get into things, the more and more I begin to
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:33.680]   think that the concept of causality is just that it's a concept, it's some sort of method
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:39.560]   that we use to try and define and determine reality and place meaning around something
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:43.880]   in such a way that we can interpret what's going on because we're not actually capable
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:50.400]   of interpreting the totality of the experience that, that really from my experience really
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:56.000]   looks like something that lacks causality, there is no cause and effect, I think it actually
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.160]   is more just the timeline is moving in both directions simultaneously in the experience
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:08.000]   for all I know, may already have been completely wrapped, which is sort of a Calvinist approach
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:14.080]   to it, you know, saying that the predestination of things I assume, but it kind of has, when
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:20.680]   you see statistical data like that that's very clear yielding an effect previously, it reminds
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:27.040]   me of what you were talking about Phillip, I just, I know that those things are possible,
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:35.200]   I don't exactly understand how they work yet, hopefully at some point I will, but it definitely,
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.600]   you have to look at it with an open mind and say, it is an effect that's happening, I don't
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:44.400]   understand how so I'm going to try and, you know, hopefully that's, I think that's what
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:48.960]   you're going to drive in that case, a lot of this stuff, we're just not there yet, you
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:54.780]   know, you know, yeah, yeah, that's, that's the whole point of, you know, of this, of this
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:50:00.480]   chat and of this ticker chat is, is to discuss the science of quantum and to really explain
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:05.280]   that we know, yeah, we're just not there yet, we don't have a vernacular for it, and we're
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:11.320]   only seeing now what it is, you know, we have flavors, right, and we have, we know what
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:17.760]   it's not, but we're seeing what it is through what it does, and that's kind of my last points
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:22.440]   that I wanted to kind of just bounce off you guys, I mean, we've only got about, we got
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:27.240]   10 more minutes before Phillip's got to go, and I know you got to go to, so if we could,
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:31.840]   we could just kind of chat for the last 10 minutes, just to talk about, okay, well, if
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:36.600]   we can't define exactly what it is, because we don't have words, we know what it's not,
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:41.000]   we know what it's kind of like, we know that it's independent of space and time, so then
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.240]   the next thing we want to say is, well, then what is, what is the application of a daily
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:51.320]   life, like what does it do, and so Phillip, great story, you just shared that, I kind of,
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:55.560]   you know, have some bullets here where I just would like to just bounce off you, I'll just
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:59.600]   get your, you know, your feedback on, on what you can do with it, or what, you know, what
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:04.960]   does it do in your daily life, and then the methods of, if we can get to that, but really
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:09.520]   for me, I think like what you were just talking about, Phillip, was the concept of, of its
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:16.160]   ability to heal, and not just heal physical, right, but healing and then wellness, right,
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:20.520]   to bring someone into wellness, and then like in my background, biological magnetics, I
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:25.680]   mean, just as a quote from like, Georges Likovsky created a multi wave oscillator, and the whole
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:31.800]   purpose of the oscillator was to bring in tune your bio field and your whole biology
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:38.040]   into its optimum residence, right, and that, and by lifting you into that optimal residence,
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:41.920]   you become the optimal physical being, you know, of who you are, you're the opt, you
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.320]   know, and then so then, of course, you were healed, if you had a problem, and so this
[00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:50.200]   whole idea of wellness is all about bringing you up to your perfect state, and of course
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:57.000]   you know that there's an effect on mood and emotions, also cognitive function, but then
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   also, too, I want to touch on, and I think this would be a good one for iron, you know,
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:06.960]   the scientist, but you want to be shaman for a second, but also the use of quantum energy
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.840]   for the concept of enlightenment.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:15.200]   So gentlemen, I mean, what are your thoughts along the idea of, you know, so we define
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:20.600]   this by what it can do? And so what do you, what do you guys say?
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:29.200]   I would like to jump in. Yes, please. Yeah, so, so the, what's, what I always tell people
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:33.600]   if they ask me a key of this energy that's in the quantum block and then the infinity
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:41.920]   block, what does it do? And in essence, it, because it is multi dimensional, and there's,
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:46.920]   there's consciousness levels in there, significant consciousness levels, quantum consciousness
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:57.920]   levels, it actually supports and underlines everything that is life giving consciousness
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:06.760]   and life supporting, and it neutralizes everything that is harmful to consciousness and harmful
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:13.760]   to the physical body, whether that's human plan, animal doesn't matter.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   And in essence, what, what it, what it does is it invites you into your own completeness
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:26.760]   and supports you with that. What does healing really mean? It becomes, it means to, to become
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:35.680]   whole or to be whole. If I'm here, I'm whole. And that has multiple aspects, obviously.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:45.320]   It's, and, and if you have an energy that can support you on that path, then you can understand,
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:51.720]   okay, why, why does that now also help with the system in response, right, that that suddenly
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:58.600]   doesn't have histamine response anymore? Just because it's neutralizing something that is
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:08.160]   harmful for that particular person. That is hard to understand. Those are just two, three
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:15.120]   sentences, but once one grasps, what that really means, they understand what it, what
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:20.920]   it does. It also doesn't, because everybody's so different, everybody is at a different
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:28.560]   state of consciousness, and a different state with her physical body, and has different,
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:32.800]   you know, a different soul plan, different things to take care of and to learn and to
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:41.240]   experience, right? That's why that's actually the only reason, the main reason why it doesn't
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:49.800]   work the very same way for everybody all the time, even though you can replicate this one
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:55.040]   example, for example, that I gave over and over again, and yes, we have improvements,
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:55:02.320]   you can see in the blood and all of that, but the exact effect of something may be different
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:12.720]   from K to I and to myself, and it always helps us there where we are, and then helps us to
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:18.640]   take a step further. That's, that's how I can explain it, and that's how I see it relate
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:23.600]   to all these points that, that you listed here on this, on this slide.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:29.840]   Yeah, I mean, we're all different TVs, right? So we're all going to experience it different,
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:36.000]   but so what do you think in terms of like using quantum energy for enlightenment? I mean,
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.960]   do you think that's possible? Could that be the next step? Because we know it really
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:46.360]   helps wellness and healing, of course, the emotional states, moods, but then I'm thinking,
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:52.320]   you know, what about cognitive function, and then also as well as enlightenment? But more
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:56.080]   and so enlightenment, because it seems like that seems to be the one missing component
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.880]   in a lot of people's lives.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:04.360]   Well, just, yeah, okay, objectively, how are you describing the enlightenment? Because
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:09.640]   that that too is one of those things that's a little, a little warm. So what would you
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:15.200]   say for the purpose of, you know, people who aren't, you know, a spiritual aspirant, who
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:20.800]   aren't helping on enlightenment? What do you think that is? I mean, how do you describe
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:21.800]   that?
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:25.800]   Oh, good question. You're right. You're right. I should have said, yeah. In my definition,
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:32.440]   enlightenment is the raising your vibration. And once you raise your vibration become,
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:38.200]   you become more like acutely aware, your senses become stronger. You can feel everything
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:43.000]   around you. You're thinking is more neutral. You're not, you're not reactive. It's kind
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.840]   of like you're able to distance yourself between stimulus and response. All of those
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:52.560]   things, you become an enlightened being by just chilling out and being able to just sense
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:56.640]   everything around you and being much more in control of yourself. And then being a higher
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:02.800]   vibratory being, you're able to kind of just expand your consciousness to understand more
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:11.920]   and you just become more of a just, you know, I mean, peaceful, wiser, gentler human, I guess
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:16.520]   is my best phrase. I'm not talking to Nirvana now. I'm just talking about, you know, being
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:18.000]   here on Earth.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:27.120]   Wow. Well said. Okay. So are you familiar with David Hawkins power versus force? No,
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.880]   I haven't heard that one.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:38.840]   It's a really good book. Hawkins was an MD PhD and very brilliant guy. And he spent most
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:47.520]   of his career as a psychologist and or psychiatrist, I suppose. But his real crux of his work
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:54.680]   was defining that his map of consciousness was kind of his seminal work. And he goes
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:59.000]   through and expresses different gradients of where people are. And he actually had a
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.800]   logarithmic scale that he put together to kind of gauge people. And it's really, it's
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:09.160]   a great read, especially for somebody like me who likes really clinical sorts of things
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:13.560]   where I can I can wrap my head around it. And and he did all of the statistical analysis
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:18.200]   of the whole thing. And it was actually his book power versus force was actually kind
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:23.840]   of the culmination of his doctoral thesis. And it's really brilliant. I would recommend
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:29.000]   anybody read it. But on that he has, and the reason it comes to mind is he has a breaking
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:34.920]   point where people hit enlightenment. And it was at on his scale of memory serves at the
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:42.000]   consciousness level was 600, I believe. But when I read the book, I remember thinking,
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.960]   ah, I know people at this point and I know people at this point. And it was interesting
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:51.480]   from the standpoint of a psychiatrist, how he broke it down with at this level of evolution,
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:56.200]   this will be your experience and at this level of evolution. And what you just said when you
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:01.400]   were explaining this really resonated with me, okay, because the idea that you become
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:08.800]   more capable of desensitizing yourself to the negativity in your environment while becoming
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:16.760]   more of a positive, positive source of motivation for those around you. And also mentally you
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:22.480]   become a stronger reference point where you're cognitively capable of doing things that
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:28.920]   other people perceive to be almost impossible. And I do remember one thing jumps out on in
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:34.760]   his book was in his discussion about, I think it was Einstein, since we were just talking
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:41.560]   about him, had capped out at the top end of human intellectual capacity, but wasn't able
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:48.880]   to go beyond that, because of his lack of acceptance of the concept that there was something
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:56.160]   far greater and more, and inherently divine in that, which I, you know, not really saying
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:00.720]   that that is or is not the case, I'm just saying it's kind of intriguing. But I would
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:06.400]   recommend everybody take a look at that, because for me, everything you listed here,
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:11.440]   you know, your healing and wellness, I know from decades of meditation that the more you
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:17.840]   do that, the more you're capable of getting your body in tune, the more capable you are
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:22.000]   of taking things that would normally be a sympathetic nervous system response and putting
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:30.400]   them into a parasympathetic state. I just did this last week with a thing called synanga,
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:36.120]   which is kind of effectively like putting capsaicin, you know, pepper spray in your eyes
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:42.560]   for the purpose of kind of retuning your ocular function. And it works very well, there's
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:48.400]   a lot of clinical data on it. The problem is it's excruciating, because you have effectively
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:55.760]   pepper spray yourself, you know, which is the least likely, the least popular flavor of
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:01:04.240]   breath spray, you know, pepper spray, you know, it's, it was interesting because you really
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.760]   do get to gauge a sense of how much in control of your own physiology are when you have somebody
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.480]   pop a bunch of pepper spray in your eyes, you know, if you're completely able to take care
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:20.000]   of your body and not allow it to go completely wackadoo crazy and your muscles tense and your
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:27.600]   respiration go off the charts, that to me would kind of be a marker of the idea that
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:33.280]   you're progressing in terms of your own evolution, because, you know, the physiology is no longer
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:40.880]   the governing factor, it's more your consciousness expressing itself through your physiology. Now,
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:46.040]   when you get on to the point of enlightenment through tools, and Phillip, I'm incredibly
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:54.120]   curious to hear your take on this, using something like one of the blocks to enhance your unconsciousness,
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:59.240]   I would say from my personal perception, that does seem to be the case. But to take
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:04.040]   you all the way to and, you know, the state that would normally be termed enlightenment or,
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.200]   you know, having probably read too much, you know, like samadhi or nirvi kalpa samadhi or
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:14.240]   one of those states, I don't know that that's actually something that you would do by, you
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:19.560]   know, putting a quantum block on your head and wearing it as a hat for many, many months.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:25.040]   I think it's actually a process that is kind of an unfolding of your own consciousness
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:31.680]   that's going to happen through time. Yes, that's exactly right. It's a process. It's much less
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:38.080]   something that just happens to us, like tomorrow, you know, suddenly you hear these stories of,
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:42.800]   okay, that person just, you know, crossed the road and suddenly was enlightened, you know,
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:49.120]   that's really not the majority. Usually it's really a process and, yeah, the quantum and
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:55.120]   the infinity block absolutely support and help with that. So my analogy is always, I know we're
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:00.480]   running hard on time here, but my analogy is like we're all working, walking on a dirt road
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:06.160]   or having a bicycle, like an old bicycle and we're riding on this dirt road. And that is
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:11.520]   our life, right? That's how we progress. We're, you know, we're having these goals and we meet
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:17.680]   different people on the way and all of that. And then suddenly there's someone about 50
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:23.600]   yards to the right and is saying, hey, you know, just why don't you come over here? You know,
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:29.440]   there's an Autobahn built here. And I got a new Lamborghini. Why don't you just, you know,
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.560]   get in and just keep going here? And it's parallel to the dirt road, right? And so you
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:43.120]   walk over, you get into this new Lamborghini and you're suddenly driving on that Autobahn and
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:49.120]   you're super fast, you're getting everywhere, way quicker. And that still doesn't mean that you
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:55.120]   may not have a flat tire every now and then and all of that. But you get there quicker. And that's
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:03.360]   exactly the same here. You know, the unlocking of our consciousness is just happening way faster
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:08.240]   and way easier. It supports us. It does not at all mean it's going to happen tomorrow. If you
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:14.400]   were in the head for a day that actually may not be a good idea to do that. So it is really something
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:23.840]   that under that supports us on our path towards that. Now, my two cents, honestly, is that being
[01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:30.480]   around these energy devices and then also wearing one, a capsule all the time. I have noticed over
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:36.400]   the last six months that I've been playing around with all of these Lelecue devices. I have
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:44.080]   distinctly found myself changing on every one of these levels right here. And I can't attribute
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.880]   it to anything other than that because my diet, everything's the same. So that's just my two cents
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:53.680]   and I can talk more about that later. I know we're out of time. So guys, thank you so much.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:59.920]   This has been a great conversation. As always, I love, I'm loving this, right? And I just want
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:05.920]   to say to everybody out there, if you want to find Ian, he's now at wizardsciences.com. He's
[01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:12.000]   got his website up and running and his new product out for sale. You've got Philip at Leila Quantum
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.360]   Tech and that's at Lelecue.com. And you can find me at the Tinkers Academy, Tinkers.academy and
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:22.080]   you're all window. And that's how you'll find us. I will put links to where you can find us in the
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:27.440]   video description and welcome all of the comments. And of course, join us on Telegram and we can
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:32.080]   chat more about this topic. And then probably we'll have another video down the road and we'll
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:35.600]   carry it forward. So gentlemen, any parting words in Mahalo?
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:42.800]   Well, I'm going to have to go back and adjust my day planner because I had full
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.840]   enlightenment scheduled for Saturday at three in the afternoon. So
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:54.240]   apparently it doesn't work that way. I'm going to have to adjust, but that leaves it open for me
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:06:01.920]   to go have some dip and dots. So I'll get that set. You're awesome. I know. Thank you. Yeah, thanks,
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:07.600]   Kay. Yeah, appreciate it as always. Thank you. And so I was a great conversation. Thank you,
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:15.680]   Ian. Thank you, Kay. And I have maybe just something for the audience. We sort of the way we live
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:22.480]   our lives and what's presented to us. Certainly, it's difficult anyway to progress in this, you know,
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:30.720]   path to enlightenment, right? But one thing is, is also something that we've been trained to in a way.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:36.160]   And that's, we're looking for the big things for the huge impacts for the
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:43.760]   enlightenment to tomorrow at three p.m., right? But we can tune our senses,
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:50.320]   reach in our senses to the little things. What are the little things? And life is so much about
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:54.800]   the little things. And if we start paying more attention to the little things,
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:07:00.960]   we'll suddenly notice also more miracles. And it really isn't always about this big thing.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.240]   Let's, let's, yeah, try to find the little things, the little miracles in our lives. And
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:13.920]   we'll notice a lot more suddenly about all progressing. Wow, really well said. My last
[01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:20.080]   my last parting words, guys, is one of the things that I brought that I put that on the slide was
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:26.160]   was because of the concept of decalcifying my pineal gland or opening up my third eye by sticking
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:33.440]   my head in a cue block, right? And I'm experimenting with that. You know, I'm seeing how it affects
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.680]   my dreams and so forth. So I'm growing my infinity blocks to a very high number,
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:44.560]   just for that purpose to see what happens. So we'll let you know what goes on. But thank you.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.480]   I'm very curious to see how that works. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, because think about it, right? I mean,
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.120]   that's one way to enlightenment is your pineal gland. So there you go. So hey, thanks, guys.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:59.200]   I'm going to let you, I'm going to go ahead and turn off the recording now and mahalo everybody
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:03.760]   for watching and spending some time with us. And hey, thanks a lot and have a great day.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:07.360]   All right, have a great weekend, guys. Okay.
