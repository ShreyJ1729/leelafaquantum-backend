[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.000]   Kay Elmer and in this video I'm gonna be doing an H2 Genesis Browns gas generator
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.440]   also known as H-H-O unboxing and setup. This H2 Genesis is brought to you by a
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.520]   company called H2 Biohacker and I just got a new one. I've got two others but I
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.160]   just got this H2 Genesis and I thought this time hey you know I did product
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.240]   reviews in the past but I've never done it unboxing to kind of show you what the
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.440]   process is to set one of these up and get them running. It's very simple. I'll try
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.440]   to keep this short and sweet and just let's just jump right into it. Now the
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.040]   first thing you're gonna get is you know this is an overview of a Browns gas
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.640]   generator if you're not familiar with it. These are all the different pieces. Take
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.920]   them just a second to kind of familiarize yourself with it but basically this
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.040]   here is the generator itself. Water goes into a tank in here and then there's an
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.800]   electrolysis process because there's electronics you've got your amp meters
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.320]   in your control panel to kind of keep an eye on what's going on. You've got your
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.720]   off and on button and then you've got a water indicator because you know it's
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.040]   important that you have you know how much water is in the tank and that you
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.000]   keep it at an adequate level at all times. Now the gas is generated here when
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.520]   the electrolysis process kicks in. It goes up an expansion chamber it comes out
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.360]   it goes through this bottle here and a second bottle and these bottles what they
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.480]   up or what they act as are filters and so they're filled with water and you
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.000]   bubble the gas through the water to basically to capture any of the sodium
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.680]   hydroxide that's used as to to expedite the electrolysis process and so
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.440]   that's kind of what these filters are for. So these are your filter bubblers and
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.960]   then when the gas finally goes through those two bubblers it goes into a drinking
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.360]   container right here and where you can connect a canula to it so you can
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.200]   inhale and then at the same time you can bubble water that you want to drink
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.520]   and that's really it. That's what a Browns gas generator does and if you've
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.160]   looked at H2 generators it's almost the same thing. So now here's the thing that
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.480]   you need to know when you buy an H2 Genesis from H2 Biohacker links below
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.840]   obviously. Now the thing is is that this is what it does not come with okay so
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.520]   before you well actually after you order your generator then you need to
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.440]   order some sodium hydroxide okay and you need to get some distilled water
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.760]   because you know they don't provide that. The reason that they don't ship
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.360]   sodium hydroxide with the box is because it's a caustic chemical and that you
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.520]   know and there's all you know the post-service tons of paperwork they don't
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.640]   go through that. It's so easy just ordered on eBay it's very cheap. Now I
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.320]   learned in this process that you should it's recommended by me that you should
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.240]   have a gram scale you know something that can measure up to 50 grams so you can
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.360]   measure the approximate amount of sodium hydroxide you need to make the
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.640]   electrolyte. Obviously you're gonna need your own measuring container it needs to
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.800]   be glass you need and then it's recommended that you excuse me that you
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.860]   have safety glasses you know so you just it's got to be real careful when you're
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.760]   mixing the electrolyte it is caustic which is the opposite of acid but it does
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.080]   the same thing to you it will burn you so you really want to be very careful so
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.040]   wear safety glasses and of course it does come with some plastic gloves but I
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.160]   found out in the process that the gloves that come with that are too small for
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.760]   my hands so I just wore my regular cheap winter gloves but that's basically it
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.720]   so this is what you need to know that you need to have everything else will
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.560]   come with the box okay and I'm going to show you in a video the whole process
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.480]   here I just want to walk you through the concepts and everything you need to
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.120]   think about. So the steps that I'm going to be going through bottom line is the
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.100]   very first thing is open the box and do a parts check you want to make sure you
[00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.140]   have all the parts just like everything else you ever open that has to be
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.000]   assembled you want to just make sure the parts are there before you get
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.200]   started so you don't piss yourself off. Okay now the next thing is the very
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.960]   second step that I this is all this is my way of doing it it is not the formal
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.880]   H2 BiRacker way this is just how I approach this this is I've multiple
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.040]   different generators and so it's not my first rodeo so this is how I do it okay
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.200]   so first thing I do is I'll go out and mix the electrolyte solution after I do
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.780]   the parts check because if there's a missing part I stopped and of course you
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.400]   know you have to go and and why even bother right but if I have all the parts
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.160]   then boom I'm gonna go and do number two I'm gonna go mix the electrolyte
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.320]   solution and the reason that's the very next step is because it gets hot and
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.040]   that's why you need like a very very I use a Pyrex pitcher all right you can
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.920]   use a mason jar because those mason jars are meant to go into pressure
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.480]   canners right so they're hardcore glass but you definitely need a very very
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.860]   sturdy glass container because it will get hot and I won't get so hot it's
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.240]   gonna melt anything but it will get hot where you're not you can't hold your
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.640]   hand to it so you're gonna want to go and because it gets hot you're gonna need
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.800]   to let it cool off so normally in like normal summer temperatures it'll take
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.960]   about an hour but you know it's winter right now I think it was like 46 today
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.840]   and it took about maybe half an hour to cool down so you definitely want to
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.400]   just do that first while that's cooling then you go back and you attach your
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.000]   bottle holders you connect all your hoses you insert the bubblers fill them
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.720]   up with water you add the expansion chamber and you and then you know when
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.280]   that when the electrolyte is cooled off then you can go ahead and fill your tank
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.960]   there you go it's really simple now the control panel when you go to turn it on
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.960]   is really quite simple others basically two sets of buttons the left and the
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.640]   right and then the display has a top and bottom so the bottom number is gonna be
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.880]   your power and then the right hand side right here it says percent power is
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.760]   what goes up and down so you can go you can make a go up and go down and you're
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.360]   gonna want to read the user guide as to what the power level setting should be
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.400]   now if you're running it at a hundred percent you're basically pumping about
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.280]   10 amps through the generator and you're gonna be burning up a lot of water
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.800]   really quickly and you're gonna have to refill it more often right and so now
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.920]   and then there's another concept to about you know how much gas can your body
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.720]   actually assimilate any given time anyway and the average male 200 pound
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.480]   human being you know basically if you set it at 40 percent in your normal
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.880]   person you're gonna about you're gonna saturate is about is you're gonna about
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.560]   you're gonna you're gonna get as much as you can take in anyway so going over
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.880]   40 percent and breathing inhalation is just really kind of like not even you
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.120]   know it's pointless so you can definitely kind of set it at 40 that's
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.840]   what I run it at when I'm inhaling and then when I when I bubble water I you
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.800]   could leave it at 40 or I just I crank it up to 100 whenever I'm bubbling water
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.120]   because I just want to get it done I want I want to infuse my water with as
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.120]   much brown gas as fast as possible because you know that's just I'm just
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.360]   that's how I do it now the next set of numbers which is that top row of numbers
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.080]   is a frequency generator now there's a little tiny frequency generator and it
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   pulses the DC Paul power to the electrolyte and the electrolysis system
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.360]   in the tank and and really what that frequency does is it allows you to impart
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.080]   a frequency into the water okay now there's a lot of discussion as to
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.280]   whether that does anything or not but it's kind of a cool thing to play with
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:17.560]   it comes out of the box set at 25 hertz now you can this thing will go up all
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.320]   the way to I believe 999 and then it'll go up another something something I
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.120]   forgot Ben told me what it was Ben is the guy from HD Fire Hacker so but the
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.360]   whole idea though is you can put a frequency in there and if you're
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.960]   familiar with frequencies and resonant frequency kind of thing you can kind of
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.280]   play with that and you could set it at whatever you want and basically you're
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.800]   basically pumping in frequencies into the water and that's what that does again
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.760]   though I want to point out there's a lot of debate about whether that does
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.280]   anything but you know it's just there because it's part of the control panel
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.240]   but the main thing right here is turning the power up and down as you're doing
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.560]   different things bubbling water versus inhaling the browns gas okay now the
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.660]   next thing you want to do is after you get it all set up and in my actual
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.200]   unboxing I did run into a problem and I had the troubleshoot my machine and I
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.600]   had to figure out what was wrong with it and I fixed it but you know there's if
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.080]   you read the quick start guide there's all these different things that it
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.440]   covers so you want to kind of familiarize yourself with the support resources so
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.400]   that you're aware of you know where to get your answers when you've got simple
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.200]   questions so basically I just want to point out links in the video description
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.920]   below that there is a quick start guide which is what I followed to do this there's
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.040]   actual full-on user manual for the H2 Genesis and there's also a telegram
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.440]   support group now it's a private group just for people who own the H2 Genesis
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.720]   okay so you've got direct access to the engineer who designed it and built it
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.200]   his name is Ben and so after you buy this you'll get invited to that group where
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.240]   you can talk to other owners and you know and just talk about whatever you
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.920]   need to talk about ask any questions and so forth okay so those are your
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.520]   support resources it's really well supported Ben's exceptional at customer
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.320]   service so you know it's it's a really good you know company in terms of just
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:04.120]   supporting their product good product etc so that's that now I also just as
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.160]   part of this unboxing video I just want to let you know that there's gonna be a
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.840]   discount code for anyone who has not bought one of these you know hey I've
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:16.000]   got worked out with Ben a discount code Calmer discount it'll save you a
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.600]   hundred bucks on on an H2 Genesis if you're interested in getting one after
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.160]   you watch this video it's gonna last as long as it's gonna last so you know
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.640]   there's no expiration date as of now so if you're interested you know I just
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.520]   just want to point out take advantage of the discount and you can go ahead and
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.360]   get yourself one all right so let's get into the video now this is how it comes
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:39.560]   basically it comes in one tape no two boxes taped together all right and so
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.960]   once you get it you're gonna basically well make sure you got both of them
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.440]   together that's the main thing that didn't get separated in in shipping so
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:51.920]   then when you open up the boxes the little box is gonna contain all of your
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.080]   parts okay so you've got your cannulas your your drinking containers your
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.080]   expansion chamber your bubbler filters your you know your your bottle holders
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.600]   all that and in the bigger box you've got the generator itself and the power
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:10.760]   court okay so now as you go ahead and unpack all of this stuff the very first
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.920]   thing you're gonna want to do obviously is a parts check so make sure you've got
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.880]   all the parts you've got the generator you've got the power court that's what's
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.440]   in the big box okay now in the little box you've got these other parts right
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.880]   here and you know like I said it's really important you do a parts check so
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.280]   really what it is is you want to make sure that you've got the basically the
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:33.120]   expansion chamber which is gonna go on top of the generator okay and then it's
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.940]   gonna come with a little you know amount of Teflon tape you're gonna need that
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.920]   Teflon tape to make sure that all your connections are tight as it relates to
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.000]   the expansion chamber you've got your two filter bubblers all right and you've
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.640]   got the hose that connects the two of them together so you've got the expansion
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.960]   chamber connects to one filter bubbler filter bubbler to the next filter
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.320]   bubbler and the filter bubbler the second filter bubbler goes to the water
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.760]   container all right and so they all have hoses and you just want to make sure
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.720]   all the hoses there okay and then of course you've also got your right here
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.720]   if you look right here I'm just gonna speed this up a bit you've got your
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.280]   bottle holders and they're basically the same thing that goes on a bicycle to
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.520]   hold a water bottle and they work perfectly for this so you can go ahead
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.720]   and attach those to the generator and you got an extra little parts packet in
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.160]   case you need any more you know air splitters and bubblers and then of
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.520]   course it does come with two seven-foot cannulas and then it also comes with
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.400]   what you need to mix the let me see if I can just get to that real quick it comes
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.880]   with what you need to mix so let's see if I get to that picture okay well there's
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.360]   the lie right there so I want to point out that you have to get your own lie
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.640]   but if you look at the bottom right there I'm just trying to see there it is
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:49.600]   right there whoop okay so then this is what else it comes with it comes with a
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:54.480]   plastic gloves a plastic spoon a little measuring cup that's kind of got it
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.200]   basically in a sharpie it's got like it says 25 grams on the cup so the you know
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.360]   with the idea that I believe h2 buyer hackers they I think that they you know
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.440]   obviously they're saying hey you know use this cup you could measure out 25 grams
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.320]   but when for the lie that I'm using and you know it all could be about
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:17.280]   particulate size creates greater volume or smaller size creates more volume
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.960]   right you know basically you know granular versus powder kind of thing but
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:26.480]   went with the lie that I bought I discovered that it's way more than 25 at
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.640]   the 25 line so that's why I recommend that you have a gram scale so you know
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:36.600]   for sure what it is so the little funnel is if you were to actually add the
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:42.240]   electrolyte directly into the generator whereas I didn't do that I and I actually
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.040]   poured the electrolyte through the expansion chamber which you know just
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.360]   it was easier so anyway you basically again right there you want to have a
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.200]   little gram scale you want to have your own electrolyte okay and then here you
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.680]   go so now this is what I was talking about I use my little gram scale to
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.480]   measure the like to measure the sodium hydroxide also known as lie and so you
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.560]   can see where this little line is on the little cup well I just kind of want to
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:11.080]   point out here as I was measuring the lie and again you know it could be that
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.680]   but the granulars of the lie that I bought are smaller than the ones he was
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:21.020]   using for measuring this but you can see we're at the 25 line right it measures
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:26.480]   out at 34 grams so you know so bottom line is you want to go but with a scale
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.280]   versus going by a line drawn on a cup because you don't know what type of lie
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.040]   you're using but at the end of the day you're gonna need 50 grams okay so you
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:42.000]   want to measure out 50 grams and you're gonna want to add 50 grams okay to 700
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.680]   milliliters of distilled water so before you get started you want to get your
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.600]   distilled water again you know I use this Pyrex container because you know it has
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.320]   measuring lines it makes it so simple mason jars don't you know so again you
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.360]   know if you have one of these they're really cheap you know it's good to get
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.320]   and you can use it for other purposes right after you wash it so anyways so
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:08.760]   you can see the distilled water only never never never never never put any other
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.760]   kind of water inside the tank if you do you will destroy the plates in your
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.720]   electrolyzer and you're out of generator okay so only used distilled water and
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.320]   so in this example you've got the very starting batch you measure it to 700
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:28.480]   milliliters with 50 grams of lie and you go ahead and just mix it up so the very
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.920]   first thing if you've never done this before you know you just pour in a little
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.960]   bit because the thing about lie is it turns into a rock as soon as it hits
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.320]   water so you've got to get in there and stir really quickly and kind of scrape
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.880]   it off the bottom and then it's gonna turn super milky and it's getting and
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.000]   then it's gonna get really hot okay so it's getting really hot it's gonna be
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.240]   milky but then you know what if you just keep stirring and stirring and
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.280]   stirring and keep it moving and I would say that I gave it a good you know like
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.720]   at least 60 seconds stir just to make sure that all the lie was dissolved so
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.740]   you want to do a little bit stir a little bit retinal the rest of it and
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.480]   stir but you got to make sure you go fast because it will turn into a rock
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.080]   and I've had that happen to me when I wasn't paying attention anyway oh and if
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.400]   you and if you notice I'm outside doing this never is another thing never never
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:20.600]   never never mix this stuff up inside your house okay I'm wearing glasses I've
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:26.040]   got my gloves on I'm outside I'm upwind to this thing because the fumes coming
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.600]   off of this when you mix it are nasty so please do not do this inside your house
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.320]   but here you go this is the example you keep stirring this thing for about 60
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.120]   seconds and you scrape off all the hard parts off the bottom and it's gonna go
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.720]   crystal clear white right now it's still just a little bit murky but as you'll
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.200]   see when I go to add it to the degenerator after it cools off it'll be
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.600]   completely clear anyway you can put the bottle holders on either side of the
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.600]   generator okay now I chose to put it now it's in the picture it's on the right
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.360]   side I chose to put it on the left side primarily because of where I have it
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.840]   positioned next to my desk because I have it this is where I keep it I you
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.160]   know want to sit there and inhale browns gas all day long while I'm working at
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.640]   home so that's why I put it on the left side but it can go on either side you
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.720]   can have one on both sides whatever you want to do but anyway that's the screw
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.800]   you put it in now in terms of I think I just jumped over this so one of the
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:24.240]   things about the the expansion chamber right here so one of the things is this
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.880]   thing comes the expansion chamber nozzle came with like teflon tape on it
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.040]   already but it was kind of all kind of like wrinkled up and stuff I took it off
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.680]   and I put on a fresh rolled three wraps just to make sure everything super tight
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.800]   because this is one thing you do not want leaking if that stuff leaks on to
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.120]   the generator it'll eat the paint off okay and you know you want it to look
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.280]   nice so then basically after I put fresh teflon tape on the nozzle then I
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.080]   basically screw on the or you're gonna do this when you have yours you screw on
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:00.280]   your expansion chamber onto the top of the generator okay so once you get that
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.680]   on then you go and you hook it up to the next thing and the next thing and the
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.640]   very next thing that you would hook up the expansion chamber to would be the
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:12.720]   first bubbler so once that's tight there you go you hook up to the first
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.620]   bubbler then you take the second one with the little hose I showed you and you
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.000]   connect that bubbler to the second bubbler and once you have the second
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.360]   bubbler then you're gonna want to connect it to the drinking container and
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.880]   it's really that simple now of course as you notice it's all empty because I
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.760]   like to put it on this in my way again I put it all together before I put any
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.120]   water in anything now here let me just talk about water without what kind of
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.760]   water do you put into the outsides of these things okay well I want to point
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:47.040]   out that the water to use in the bubblers the filters should also be
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:52.840]   distilled water and when you need to fill up your tank again because you're
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.800]   keeping an eye on that meter right on the front of it you're gonna want to use
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.160]   the water out of these filter bubblers now the rule of thumb is you should
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:07.600]   empty these and refill them with fresh distilled water every 10 hours of run
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.800]   and you got a ballpark it and keep track okay but the bottom line is what these
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.440]   things capture is any residual side sodium hydroxide that escapes with the
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.800]   gas and that's what it's for it traps any residuals we're talking parts per
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:26.080]   million sometimes parts per billion of you know sodium hydroxide getting into
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.440]   the filter bubbler water you're never gonna drink this or you do not drink
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.000]   this but it just basically a port back into the generator okay through the
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.200]   expansion chamber the top of the expansion chamber and you'll see that in
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.920]   a second so that's what these are for every 10 hours give it fresh distilled
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.800]   water take what you have water that you have in it and you pour it back into
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.600]   the expansion chamber now you never want to overfill your expands in chambers so
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.080]   you'll be able to tell if the water gets too high and you can see it inside the
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.000]   chamber it's full okay and then if you have any excess in the bubblers you just
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.280]   throw it away but the bottom line is that's what these filters are for so
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.680]   filter out the light and at the same time you use that water to put back into your
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.960]   jenny to keep it filled and keep it running all right because it's gonna be
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.800]   burning up water to make hydrogen and oxygen for you okay so then of course
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.600]   you got the power cord you want to put power connect it to power and then once
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.160]   you've got the bubblers filled up you're gonna and you've got everything's plugged
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.400]   in and everything's connected then you want to take your now notice it's
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.680]   perfectly clear now it's cooled off that's your electrolyte that I did earlier
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.400]   outside and then you see how the top of the expansion chamber just pops right
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.680]   off with some like teflon tape to keep it snug and then that's how I did it I
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.840]   just pour it right in there it's a lot easier than trying to use a tiny funnel
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.760]   with a tiny nozzle just do this and then save yourself some trouble and then
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.240]   notice I do have a towel wrapped around the bottom because I don't want to get
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.840]   any spills any drops anything onto my generator again it'll eat the paint okay
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:55.240]   so then here you go once I pour the 700 milliliters in then basically I put
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:00.960]   the cover back on however now the machine will take up to 1.1 liters and that
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.560]   1.1 equals full all right if you read the quick start guide it says you go
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.400]   ahead and get it up to 0.8 so I just added after this I didn't film it I added a
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.120]   little bit more just plain distilled water into the expansion chamber and
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.760]   mine actually popped up to 0.9 there's a little bit of a delay between what
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.280]   you're looking at on the in the gauge in the front as and and what you're pouring
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.320]   so as I was pouring it in I saw 0.8 and I stopped little did I know it went up to
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.800]   0.9 after that because there's a little delay before that gauge you know
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.280]   actually you know accurately levels right so that's fine though the main
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.240]   thing is you don't want to go over 1.1 liters and so and then keeping it at
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.800]   0.9 actually is about 50% full and that's fine it runs perfectly fine at 50%
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:49.000]   full and so but you know bottom line though is you don't want to go over 1.1
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.760]   and so I try to keep it at 0.9 to 1 at all times so that you don't have
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.960]   problems with over filling and you don't have problems with not having enough
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.320]   water in it so once you fill up once you pour water into your Jenny then you
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.800]   basically take the top of the expansion chamber and you just snugly fit it right
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:13.600]   back onto the top and you are good to go and you go ahead and you're done you
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.160]   just turn on that Jenny and you're good to go now here here's where I ran into a
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.760]   problem I went ahead and turned it on and I got power I've got my control
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:27.080]   panels going my gauges are reading I'm putting amps in there it's at a hundred
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:32.840]   percent power and look over here nothing no gas was coming out of the
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:37.880]   generator so that's kind of where I was like okay so I had to stop now so I this
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.000]   is what I did I took out the user guide and I went through the troubleshooting
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.880]   steps and I had to check every single little connection that I made because
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.000]   any one of those little connections all the hoses and everything expansion
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.240]   chamber you name it could be leaking air you know or gas right so I checked all
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.120]   of it everything was snug and then I finally figured out there you know why
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.480]   you know where it was having the problem and because when I went back and I took
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:08.920]   the top of the expansion chamber off and I listened to what was going on inside
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:14.280]   the tank and I could hear water bubbling inside the Jenny all right so the water
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.840]   the gas was coming out of the generator but it wasn't getting into the filters
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:24.120]   and so I discovered okay well what's blocking it and it turns out to be that
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.720]   little tiny valve on the top of the expansion chamber this is mine okay just
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:32.960]   for me but mine mine had the little valve on the top of the expansion chamber was
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.440]   blocked whatever was defective part so I just took it off right there so you see
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:44.640]   right here whoops right there right there I took off the little valve and I just
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.320]   connected the hose directly to the expansion chamber because it works fine
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:53.040]   you don't have to have the valve there okay so so I just connected it directly
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.000]   to the expansion chamber and once I got that valve out of the way then the gas
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.240]   was free to flow and my Jenny worked just fine so there's that little valve and
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.440]   that thing was just effective nobody's fault you know they don't make those
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.840]   themselves so that you know but bottom line is if you remember that little
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.040]   parts bag I could easily just put one back up there but I don't really want to
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.720]   mess with it I got it running I'm very happy so then I want to turn it down to
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.560]   40 so I can go ahead and inhale so this is how you would turn it down you push
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.880]   the down button it turns down the power again you said it at 40 now if I could
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.960]   make the power go up by pushing the up button and then these two buttons on the
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.880]   left again are the frequency now what I like to do for frequencies I like to
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:34.600]   set mine to like 528 you know it's like the Salfegio range there's also the
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.280]   nozier range there's different ranges of frequencies and feel free I mean this
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.120]   is something you want to play with to see what works best for you and other
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.000]   people kind of like you know some people actually report that they feel
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.400]   differently breathing browns gas depending on the frequency that they're
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.800]   running into the tank well you know you never know right okay so that's
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.360]   basically it so let me kind of show you this is what I this is my setup so this
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:24:01.600]   is my desk it's I made a mistake when I bought my desk when I moved and I just
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.880]   it looked big in the picture but it turned out to be really small so anyway
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.280]   I got a TV tray but anyway this is how this is how I set it up so it's just
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.000]   sitting next to my desk and you can see why I put the bubblers on the left
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.500]   right so and then but this is how I do it instead of bubbling into that
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.280]   container I have one of these you know like these Leila quantum water bottles
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.960]   and and so I kind of just like to bubble my water in the actual stainless steel
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.520]   water bottle so I just you know I don't mess around with the you know the
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.560]   little splitters and all of that it's just you know it's just too many tubes
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:36.840]   right so I just kind of keep it simple and I just have one tube that I have
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.280]   hanging over my generator and the other tube is my cannula right so I just and
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.520]   I just swap them out by hand right here at the second bubble whenever I need to
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.440]   swap back and forth and you don't drink that many water bottles every day you
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.320]   know for that to be a hassle mainly like 99% of the day I've got a cannula on and
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:25:00.320]   I'm breathing but basically I bubble into my my Leila Q water bottle using a
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.440]   bubbler stone and then I just pluck that out plug in my cannula and I'm good to
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.200]   go and I turn it up and down depending on what I'm doing and that's really it
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.000]   so that's my setup the last thing I want to leave you with before I leave you
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.720]   is one of the things about accessories that I really want to point out which is
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.440]   really cool about H2 Genesis is that you know you one of the concepts of
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.760]   browns gases and it's really really helpful to be bubbling water if you know
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:33.200]   like studies show or not studies but anecdotal testimonies have indicated
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.840]   that if you could drink at least 1.5 liters of bubbled water a day that it has
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.960]   therapeutic effects right so that's a really good thing to do and that's what
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:47.440]   I do one of those Leila bottles is like I think 7 like 75 or 0.75 milliliters so
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.320]   just two of those a day right I bubble to those a day to get a therapeutic
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.000]   effective browns gas drink from just drinking and then on top of that I'm
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.520]   inhaling but there's another way to benefit from browns gas that a lot of
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.840]   people kind of overlook and and so one of the things I want to point out is that
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.480]   you can what we call bagging and so these are some of the accessories now
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.560]   the accessories on the left are things that I got off of Amazon and promo life
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:17.400]   okay and where their plastic cast covers right like for when you're hurt you know
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.640]   and so you got one for arms and you got for like no those work just fine and you
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.120]   can get those on Amazon and you can just basically take your water bubbler
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.520]   stone right and you just you know and connect it to your generator and you
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.520]   just stick that in the bag and then tighten it down and the bag fills up and
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:40.640]   you can basically treat yourself topically with browns gas okay so that's a really
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.840]   cool accessory I just want to point this out to you know it's not included in the
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.200]   box all right but it is something that's like the third way to benefit from and
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.280]   if you're going to get a generator and spend that level of money you're going
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.720]   to want to maximize your you know the benefit that you're going to get from
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:00.560]   having the browns gas generator so definitely try bagging I just my
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:06.680]   testimony on bagging is one time I burnt the holy crap out of my hand
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:12.080]   cooking by getting hot grease on my wrist and I had like three quarter in
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:18.200]   size third-degree burns basically on my wrist and it was painful and so what I
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.560]   did was I grabbed one of these that I just happened to have and I plugged into
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.240]   my browns gas and that thing puffed up like a big balloon right not my hand
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:31.520]   the bag and then I just treated it for like I don't know through a whole movie
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.120]   or something right and I'll tell you what like within like before I even
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:40.120]   noticed and it was like really painful these things were blistered out and the
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:45.840]   burns right but within is you know within the movie time right the pain was
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.160]   gone and I you know and so it was just amazing that the you know it just because
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.680]   nothing else would do that and six that's all I did was use the browns gas
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:59.000]   and so my personal testimony on bagging was that it eliminated the pain and the
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.520]   thing about it was the pain wasn't just gone that moment it was never it never
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:07.440]   came back it took several weeks for the blisters to you know some side and the
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.680]   burned the heel but from that moment on it never hurt again and I was just
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.880]   just shocked just shocked that it was like that effective but that's just my
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.680]   testimony so I'm a big proponent of bagging with browns gas so again go to
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.840]   Amazon if you want to get the plastic one but there's one downside to the
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.720]   plastic ones and that is that you get really really really sweaty so they get
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.560]   really wet and you know and that you know whether you you like that or not
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.120]   that's gets it's like you know but it's gonna get really kind of gross now this
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.760]   other bag that I've got over here is a teflon bag and it's also a leg bed but
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.880]   it's not like it's not like a cast cover and I really just kind of wanted
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.280]   point it out because I actually used to use that with my browns gas generator
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.640]   another one and the thing about it the reason it's made out of teflon because
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.520]   I use I also do ozone bagging and so that you know if for ozone you have to
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.360]   use a teflon teflon tubing and teflon bags so that's why I have a teflon leg
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.280]   bag but it you know it works right so it's just another form another type of
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:10.560]   bag that you can use for topical application of gas now if you if you are
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:15.040]   interested in teflon bags you know you can get those off us off of you know and
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.520]   just go search for it and then of course the plastic bags but this is the
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:23.640]   what I want to point out was about a year or so ago H2 Genesis started maker
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:30.400]   H2 biohacker started making these these sleeves and what's really cool is
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:34.640]   they're making they're made out of this material that's kind of like the stuff
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.760]   that they make tents out of right and it what's really weird is you wouldn't
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:44.520]   think that a cloth bag would hold the gas well but it actually holds it really
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.800]   really well and so the way they make these sleeves is you and they're very
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.560]   versatile so you can put it any you can like basically target whatever area of
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:57.280]   your body that's hurting you right you've gotten you cinch off both ends and then
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.600]   you put the tube in there and then and then it pop it poofs up with the gas but
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.880]   then it doesn't get so expanding where you have to let the gas out it just kind
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.000]   of it's just it's like perfect it's perfect material that will hold it enough
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.740]   gas in but once the pressure builds out it'll let it seep naturally out and it's
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.760]   really really kind of handful I mean handy and those are available on the H2
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.880]   biohacker website so you know if you're interested in bagging I just I just
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.920]   really wanted to point that out this is going to just close the the loop here
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:33.440]   okay so again that is how you set up the H2 Genesis from H2 biohacker all
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.460]   right again there's a discount code to try to save you guys some money thank

[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:11.000]   resources I've been collecting information about browns gas for a couple
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.960]   of years now I'm just fascinated by it so it's everything is on that site
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.360]   everything from the patents for it different videos I've done about it and
