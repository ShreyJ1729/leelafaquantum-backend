[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.880]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and in this video I just want to share with you some of the
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.680]   new boosters that I've been working on as it relates to the frequency medicine, quantum
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.400]   healing thing that I've been covering lately in some of my videos, and also not just cover
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.360]   like what I'm doing, but also how to do it for any of you that are new to Layla Q and
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.720]   Q blocks and things like that that might want to learn, you know, how do you go ahead and
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.040]   make your own frequency cards. So before I get into it, you know, I do know that there
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.400]   are people that kind of pop in on my videos and may not have that backstory of what this
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.760]   is all about. So I'm going to do a really brief overview, otherwise this could get really
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.360]   long. So this is about frequency medicine, and that's what these frequency cards are
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.840]   for. And what I mean by that is that if you think about the human body, we really kind
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.760]   of like three things. This is all the way I look at at life. We are biochemical, obviously,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.080]   right? You know, we all carry around when we're basically a soul in a meat sack, or if
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.760]   you believe in souls. But you know, we have we know we were meat. And then we're also
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.760]   bio electrical magnetic. I mean, you know, we have almost all of our chemical processes
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.760]   are driven by electrical pulses in the body. And that's a whole other subject. And then
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.840]   we're also, we're and then you that's your bio electrical field. And then there's this
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.760]   other thing called the human bio field. And that relates to the concept that we are energy,
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.600]   you know, we are energy beings, not bio electrical energy, but actual life force energy. And
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.040]   depending on what culture you're from, you know, some cultures refer to it as prana, as
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.800]   chi, as organ, you know, there's all these different words and different cultures that
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.400]   explain what that life force energy is. So there's these three things that we are. And
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.120]   now, you know, basically, you know, like academic, modern medicine, they're totally, totally
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.760]   focused on the biochemical aspect of ourselves. And they don't focus at all on the other two.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.240]   Now there are some things that are bio electrical magnetic devices that do focus on the human
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.920]   bio electrical field and interact with it in certain ways, work in, you know, be beneficial
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.000]   and or in healing modalities. And I cover that in my electoral healing series. But then
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.320]   what this one is about is specific to the human bio field. And what can you do to work
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.400]   with the human bio field and helping yourself in that aspect. And so when you look at the
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.920]   frequencies that are out there that you can use as part of the concept of frequency medicine
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.200]   and in my way of kind of categorizing them is that they're basically three as well, right?
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.480]   There's what I call etheric frequencies, which when you look at something like, you know,
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.120]   the Leleque healer network, these are all incredibly gifted humans that have talents that, you
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.400]   know, the average person just, you know, just doesn't have, you know, and these individuals
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.880]   have have these talents and they could literally see frequencies, manipulate frequencies, pull
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.960]   frequencies from what I would refer to as the ether and then and create like, you know,
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.840]   these these frequencies, they call them frequencies, but I don't even know, you know, if there's
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.040]   a language that really describes that, but it's it's from the ether, it's etheric. And
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.280]   then these frequencies like abundance and prosperity and weight loss, they're they're just they're
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.800]   just like an energy that's been put into some of you know, these cards and these devices
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.400]   that came from another person who conjured it into into existence from everything in
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.440]   the universe. It's really hard to explain it. And again, I just want to say that there's
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.840]   no language for this. So there are there are no words I could use to properly describe
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.200]   it. I'm just trying to flumbling through with my monkey mind, trying to explain what an etheric
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.560]   fear, a theory frequency is. So please pardon my my monkey mind. But the other one that's
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.360]   really easy and where this is where I come into play, there are the molecular frequencies.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.880]   Okay, that's real. That's is, you know, you can calculate what a molecular frequency is
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.000]   of any substance in existence that we could touch and feel. And then there's also the
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.640]   resonant frequencies and these resonant frequencies are sound, right? It's just basically the
[00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.000]   sound. And you know, and it's what the human ear can and cannot perceive it all up and
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.100]   down the spectrum of frequencies that have modulation and amplitude. And you know, when
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.040]   you put it out of speaker, you could you know, if you're you know, depending on your hearing
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.640]   range, you could hear it or not. But that's the whole idea of resonant frequencies are
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.280]   sound. Molecular are frequencies that come from objects and substances. And then etheric
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.280]   is that whole other thing. So now what were I dabble? Okay, because I don't have the
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.240]   gifts and talents to basic, you know, like the folks in the healer network where I can
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.360]   just pull down and or create frequencies from the ether. I kind of really kind of focus
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.200]   on the molecular because that's something that I can manage. I can I can handle. I can
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.560]   also do a resident, but I haven't started with that one yet. And I think that's a whole
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.400]   another series of videos to kind of like say, how do you capture resonant frequencies. But
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.180]   for right now, I'm talking about molecular frequencies. And this is what that means.
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.540]   And basically, you know, it's if you go on, just go to YouTube. And if you go to YouTube,
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.480]   and just type in calculating molecular frequency, and you're going to see video after video,
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.480]   after video of all these physicists and mathematics and mathematicians explaining how you can
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.720]   calculate molecular frequency. Because the idea of molecular frequency is that every
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.220]   atom, which is this diagram on the left, every atom in existence and everything's comprised
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:31.360]   of atoms, has, you know, typically has a neutron, some don't have a neutron, some don't have
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:37.480]   a, you know, but anyway. But you know, basically, they have elements, okay, neutrons, protons,
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.440]   electrons, quarks, etc. And and all of these different things are spinning. Okay, they're
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.800]   just spinning around like little planets, little moons, all that stuff. And that's that's
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.280]   quantum mechanics. That's, you know, atomic theory and all that. And so these atoms are
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.800]   constantly in motion because of all the particles that are in motion. And then when you have
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.500]   something like this on the right, which is your H2O molecule, water molecule, you know,
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.900]   one hydrogen, sorry, two hydrogens, one oxygen, right, or, or H2, yeah, two hydrogens, one
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.520]   oxygen molecule. So you got this big ol oxygen molecule, you got two little hydrogen, I got
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:18.260]   one, sorry, you have a big oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms all attached to each other,
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:24.220]   right, they form a molecule, atoms form, connect and then four molecules. And then even when
[00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.340]   they're so they're individually spinning around and creating frequencies. And then when they're
[00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.980]   in combination and stuck to each other, they're also modulating in different types of of patterns,
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:42.880]   right, that create motion again. And every time anything moves, spins, it's vibrating
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.520]   and what vibrations cause our frequencies. And these are molecular frequencies. And as
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.320]   I said, you know, you can go and it's physics and you can calculate what those molecular
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.840]   frequencies are based on how fast things spin around and how they're connected to each
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:01.760]   other. Simple as that. Or not. So now this is what I do and this is how I create boosters
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.480]   and this is how you can create boosters for yourself that are designed for whatever you
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.880]   want to have done or you know, whatever objectives you have. But the idea of what I do and so
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.360]   what I started with and you can do this with essential oils, I mean, there's people in
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:20.080]   our telegram chat group on the quantum power group, you know, that we've got on telegram.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.600]   And there are folks in there that are traditional Chinese medicine folks. There are folks in
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.600]   there that are herbologists, right? And these individuals are conjuring up all sorts of
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:34.680]   different combinations or specific types of herbs and essential oils and so forth that
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.160]   they're actually using and then they're burning in those frequencies and the objects and using
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.880]   that for healing modalities as well. And so my focus though is more so on supplementation
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.640]   because I'm really into supplements. And I found and this is what the basis of the
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.320]   men and women's boosters was was I went and collected. I did a lot of research. I'm like,
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:59.160]   let's say, you know, I want to create a booster for, you know, anti aging. I want to create
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.600]   a booster in this case, you know, for, you know, to improve my energy because man, I don't
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:10.840]   know lately, I'm really fatigued. My day job is just dragging on me. And I don't sleep
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.760]   well. And so I've just been just dragging my ochole. And that is your Hawaiian word for
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:22.280]   the day. Ochole, it means you're behind in Hawaiian. So I've been dragging my cola around. I'm just
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.520]   tired as heck. And so I decided, you know, I need an energy booster. But you know, I
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.120]   don't want to be chugging coffee all day and then wire myself out. So I was thinking,
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.240]   well, why don't I, you know, and you know, I do drink coffee, which is my biochemical
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.800]   self, right? And my bio electrical self, I actually do charge myself up with, you know,
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:45.920]   with electrical devices like PMF or like a or CNR. And I actually trickle charged my my
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.480]   bio electrical self and then increase my like my voltage, right, increase my battery, my
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.600]   human battery. And then the third thing though, is I want to, you know, want to take advantage
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:00.440]   of the molecular frequencies. And how else could I add more to my overall package of,
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.480]   you know, how I handle my life in terms of like, how do I, you know, feel better about
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.000]   it? So I wanted to create an energy booster. And so I take supplements. And this is what
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.640]   I do. And the molecular frequencies of the supplements, then go into the Leila quantum
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:20.640]   block. And what this device is, if you're not familiar with it, it's a, it's basically
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:26.000]   a quantum. Well, wow, that's a hard, hard thing. I just popped in my head. How do I
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.040]   describe a quantum block? It to someone who's never heard of it. Okay, well, try to imagine
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:37.800]   um, like this little like reactor, and it's all this energy and the middle of this like
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:44.000]   center of just mass. This is incredible, vast, bright, you know, glowing light in the middle
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.640]   of that light, right, is where the light and the energy is concentrated the most. Right,
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.720]   that's what this is. This is, and this is that third energy that life force source prana
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:00.040]   energy. Okay, all of that. This is what these devices do. And there's a, by the way, I know
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.600]   this sounds absolutely crazy. Because what are you looking at? You're looking at two
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   metal bars or two metal plates and four metal bars are rods. Okay, so if you take a look
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.680]   at some other videos for anyone who skeptical even thinks I'm crazy about this, take a look
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:22.360]   at the test results. This device is real. There are actual physical evidence test results
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:27.800]   done by third party institutes in Europe that have validated it. That there's actually
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.920]   a, you know, an energy present and that that energy affects biological beings. Okay. And
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.880]   what I mean by that they've actually had these things tested where people put their
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.320]   hands in them devices that are charged with them like water bottles and pendants and cards
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:47.160]   and dog collars that those things actually affect the biological beings who come into
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.640]   contact with them because they've been inside of a Leila quantum block and how that was
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:58.320]   validated. Check out the test results video if you want is through heart rate variability
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:04.320]   testing, you know, dark field microscopy testing looking at blood before and after and also
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.120]   through bio and bio energetic testing. And so there's these third party independent institutes
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:15.240]   that test stuff. And they've actually validated and certified all of these type this all of
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:20.640]   this Leila stuff as real. It actually does what it's claimed to do. And so that's why
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.440]   I use it. So now I basically take the supplements. It's got, you know, all of these molecular
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:31.200]   frequencies collected together. I put them in the block. And then I create what a ride
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.360]   just create. And then I create that frequency set. It's a set of frequencies, a different
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.480]   molecular frequencies, all in one group. And I call it a booster. And that's what a booster
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.080]   is. And now what do you do with those things? Well, you could put the frequency in into
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.600]   the into the quantum block. And then you could charge that frequency, you could put that
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.080]   frequency into water, you could put it in dependence and so forth. That's the different
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.840]   products that you could do. And it's just unlimited. You could do this with rocks, throw
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.280]   them in your garden, you could do this with with anything dog bowls, you name it. I mean,
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.900]   you could pretty much put the frequency of let's say all these supplements into whatever
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.320]   you want. I could, you know, and like I could get it like a little wristband and put the
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.220]   energy frequency in a wristband and then carry it around with me all day long on my wrist,
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:20.360]   that sort of thing. But that's how you capture frequencies. Okay. And that's so this is that
[00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.400]   part of it. So now up till now, I just want to share that the frequencies or what I call
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.800]   the boosters that I've done so far. And these are the two that are for sale right now on
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.840]   Leila quantum power point, sorry, on a quantum tech website is that they're right now, they're
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.440]   carrying the men's booster and the woman's booster that I've created about a year ago.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:46.520]   And they carry that in the form of a card or as a pendant. And what that is, like if you
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:53.040]   just take a look at the men's booster, it's actually five separate and I have a video on
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.200]   how I made these. So if you want to see how much is in there, like there's over 50 different
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:03.520]   supplements in each one of these, the men's and the women's. I think there's 62 and the
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.000]   women's are so much in there. But all these different supplements that are in there on
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.160]   the molecular frequencies of them, right are in the booster. But so what what I did was
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.560]   for the men's was I actually did the research on it. And you know, when I talk about research,
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.640]   I mean, I've literally spent hours and hours and hours and and just like for example, for
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:28.200]   the, the energy booster, I basically do a search on, Hey, what's the best supplements
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.840]   for boosting energy? And then I didn't you pop up all of these different articles, the
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:39.080]   best 11 vitamins to for energy, the best ones in 2021, the top three this, and I literally
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:46.360]   read 123 pages in to the search engine, all of these different articles about like everybody's
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:52.280]   recommendation is what's the best supplements you could have or use right and take to boost
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.640]   your energy. And that's what goes into a booster. Okay, I did that for all of these
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.040]   other ones. So that's the energy one. And then again, like the one I'm doing now, what
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.400]   I'm going to show you is I did the allergy, same thing and 10 best, you know, 18 best.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.920]   And what's good for people with allergies, the three top ones, top nine natural, you
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.400]   know, blah, blah, blah. And I go to three pages in and I usually spend a couple of days reading
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:20.200]   about what's the best supplements for particular objective. And then I go and collect all those
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.040]   supplements. And then I go ahead and I burn those into into a frequency card. So that's
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:29.040]   kind of what I did. So like if you look at my men's booster video or my woman's booster
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.520]   video, you'll see that, you know, it gets comprised of actually separate other boosters.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:39.520]   So the men's booster is a whole bunch of supplements for anti aging. Same thing for brain cognitive
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.160]   functioning, memory and so forth, immune boosting, boost up your immune system. Boy, isn't that
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.680]   a hot topic now? A stress booster, which is, you know, how do you know, all the different
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.440]   things that you know, everyone recommends to reduce your stress, manage your stress,
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.000]   keep you calm. And then for men, this specifically, it's a testosterone booster. You know, we
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.080]   got to boost up, you know, that's not just what you, you know, people think, Oh, testosterone.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.640]   No, no, no, it's actually that and it's also vitality. It's also energy and you know,
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.320]   men, right? So we need that if you don't have it, you know, you don't, you know, you have problems,
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:13.920]   right? Literally have physical problems. So I put that all there's five separate boosters
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:19.600]   inside the men's booster. Now the woman's booster has five separate boosters as well.
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.480]   It has the anti aging, the brain, the immune, the stress, but instead of obviously you don't
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:29.760]   want women to get a testosterone booster, I wouldn't create it a separate one called the female booster,
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:37.040]   which has a whole bunch of different supplements that aim at everything that are, that are hot
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:44.480]   topics for women, starting with, you know, regulating hormonal behaviors, hair, nails, eyes, teeth,
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.400]   you know, skin, authors, you know, bones and all those kinds of things. Things that women are most
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:56.080]   concerned about, you know, in, in as a age. And so then that's all of those frequencies are built
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.480]   into that woman's booster. And this thing has been on sale for, I don't think about a year now and
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.600]   the feedback, if you read, if you just go into the, into the telegram group, the feedback from people
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.640]   who have purchased these and that are wearing them as pendants is pretty cool. People are actually
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:15.040]   benefiting. Remember now, you know, there's, it's affecting your bio field. It actually does
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:20.480]   something. It actually helps you. And so, you know, and it's not the chemical aspect of it. It's a
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:27.200]   much more subtle, you know, approach towards your overall well-being, but it's real and it does
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.240]   affect you in a very positive way. And so those are the two boosters that I've done before that
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.080]   worked. And I want to point out that, you know, you don't hit a home run every time. I actually
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.800]   created two other boosters that just fell flat. And by the way, every time I create a booster,
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:46.240]   I send it over to Philip von Holzendorf over at Lelekeu. And he and his team of healers,
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:52.000]   the healer network, they kind of, they take a look at what I create and if it actually works,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   you know, they got, and they pick up on it, then that's how we ended up, you know, putting it on
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.440]   the website. And he created a product out of it. So kind of like, we're going to, I'm going to be
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:06.960]   sending him these two new ones, the energy and the allergy booster to see, you know, if they, you
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.280]   know, if they work, and they do what they, they, they claim to say, you know, I'm claiming that
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.280]   they'll do like what they're supposed to do with, you know, the supplements are, are, are for these
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:20.080]   particular issues. And then if that, if it turns out to be that, hey, these are, you know, these
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:25.760]   work, then, then they'll probably be on the Lelekeu website as well, and to include the
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.720]   other boosters that are offered there. So, you know, just kind of just show you kind of like,
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:35.680]   where they put them. This is the Lelekeu website. So if you click right here on the frequency list,
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:42.400]   I just want to point out like where I show up on this website. But it's the Lelekeu website,
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.960]   the Quantum Tech website, and they sell different frequency cards. So if you click right here on
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:52.000]   the frequency cards, you can see right here the men's booster by calmer and the woman's boosters,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:18:00.080]   you can buy the card, or if you go into their other site, you could see where right there,
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.920]   there's the actual pendants. That's the men's booster and the woman's booster, right? So that's
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.480]   kind of how it works right there. So that's kind of what those are right now. So we'll be testing out
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:14.080]   the energy and the allergy booster to see if those work. And hopefully they do work. And then if,
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.000]   you know, for people who suffer with allergies, for people that just need to lift up, you know,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.240]   lift up and they need some energy, then you know, these, these will be great frequencies for you.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.920]   Probably won't know that for a month or so, but I just wanted to give you a heads up that that's
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.400]   coming down the pipe. So now let me level set. Oh, I'm sorry. I have one more booster. I just
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:35.680]   want to point out this just popped up. Like, I think yesterday morning, yesterday morning,
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.480]   someone reached out to me from the telegram group. And I and basically, you know, told me
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:46.480]   that they had a family member who was having a cardio problem. And they were just saying,
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:51.520]   hey, is there anything we could do? And I mean, from a quantum healing standpoint. And so I thought,
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:56.320]   well, hey, let's let me go ahead and put this together. And I'm doing an experiment right now,
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:02.480]   a quantum entangled experiment where I just went to my, I have a lot of supplements, folks. I have
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.920]   a whole five drawer giant cabinet of supplements. And so I went in there and I did the quick research.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:13.520]   I slammed together some quick research. I figured out the top 15 to improve cardiovascular health,
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:20.800]   you know, the blood flow and all that. And I actually had 12 of the 15, actually, I had 13
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:27.760]   of the 15 substances, supplements on hand already. So I whipped up a quick booster. And then I'm
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.320]   actually helping that family member right now in a quantum entanglement experiment. That'll be in
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:38.880]   the next video I make. And seeing if those frequencies can help that individual. So asterisk, it's not
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:44.960]   done yet. I'm still working on it, but I've got quote 13 out of 15 in a in a in a frequency set.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.600]   And I'm actually testing it right now to see if I can, if that'll help somebody. Okay, but that's
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.160]   the third one. It's gonna, and if it does help, then that'll be another one coming along for
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.480]   anybody that you know who has heart problems, or blood, you know, blood clotting and all that
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:05.280]   kind of stuff problems. Anyway, so this is what is inside those boosters. So right now the energy
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:12.080]   booster has 16 different supplements based on the research that I did the, you know, a compilation
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:19.280]   of extensive research of what are all the top ones. And it's everything from ashwagandha to PQQ
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:25.760]   to also triline. But there's a lot of different recommended substances or supplements where if
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.240]   you were to go to a nutritionalist and say, you know, I need something to boost my energy,
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.440]   you're gonna get this list. Okay, and this list comes from like a couple dozen different sources,
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.720]   where there's a lot of redundancy, and there's some unique ones, and I go and research each one
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.960]   of these things, and how they actually help you boost your energy. And then I went and collected
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.680]   all of them. And you know, everyone's always real interested in the cost, right? Because you
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.040]   know, that's first thing I think about when I see people do stuff like what's that cost.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:54.160]   So here's the cost of collecting all of these different substances. So you know, just the energy
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:00.160]   booster loan, if you wanted to create it yourself, you'd put together $252 worth of supplements just
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.720]   to be able to burn one frequency. And then you could use that frequency for, you know, like I
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.480]   see, you know, from the cards and so forth. But that's what that cost to put together was the
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:14.560]   energy booster. Now the allergy booster, you know, has a total of nine different frequencies in it.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.400]   You know, and there's they kind of range all up and down in terms of cost. I mean, like Sheila
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.040]   Jeet, if you're if anyone's familiar with Sheila Jeet, you know, it's not cheap at all. And so that
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:28.640]   was probably the most expensive, you know, substance right next to you bick one all, you know, in in
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.560]   the energy booster. But you could see somewhere as low as like $5 a dose all the way up to like,
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:36.560]   you know, $37 just to be able to cap, you know, get the bottle so you could have
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:42.960]   a sample of that substance. And so on this one, you know, there is this, interestingly enough,
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.560]   highly recommended amway product called clear guard that Philip recommended saying that we're
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.720]   awesome for him. So I'm like, okay, that's got to go in the booster, right? So there's nine different
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:59.440]   substances in the allergy booster. And they and it came out to a total, if you know, if you wanted
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:04.560]   to put it together yourself, you know, came out to $168 to put that together. And that's just to
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.640]   help anyone with allergies, you know. And then the third one, like I said, I'm working on this
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:16.240]   other one, it has 17 different substances or supplements in it for the cardio booster.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:22.800]   And it ranges all up and down the scale. And so I put all of this together. And I only had a couple
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.040]   of these two guys right there that I didn't have on hand. So I just ordered them. And then once
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.160]   they come in, I'll be able to complete the card and that and just to have, you know, as an FYI,
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.840]   you know, for cardio booster, it's $287. That's what it costs to put this together.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.920]   So that's kind of what the price ranges are. So, you know, that's, that's really it in a nutshell.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.720]   This is, you know, what it is, why do it and how you do it is coming up. So let me go
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.880]   ahead and show you this. And then this is a little video because everyone likes demonstrations.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.360]   So here's the video on how I did it.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:23:01.440]   Okay. So in order to make the energy and allergy boosters, basically have assembled all of the
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.560]   different supplements that I had mentioned earlier. And then so these are all the supplements for
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:12.880]   the energy booster. And there are a couple of liquids because I've got the C6 oil and the iodine.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.760]   And what I do is I use these little tiny, like, I think they're eight ounce, I buy these by the
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.400]   case, these little cups work really well to kind of put them all in. And then I just kind of label
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:28.000]   it. So if I want to add more later, I can do a reburn with more supplements that if I wanted to
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.040]   kind of like upgrade later on. So what I do is I just put them all in a little cup and label them
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:38.000]   so that I know what it is. And then I could use this cup and then put that into the cube block
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.600]   to go ahead and burn the booster. So these are the various different supplements that came out of
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:49.120]   the research to boost energy. And then over here are the various supplements and then one pharmaceutical
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:55.520]   to boost the, you know, for, I called it an allergy booster, but really it's allergy relief.
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:00.080]   And again, right here is all of the different supplements for that. There is one fluid. So I'm
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.440]   going to have to go ahead and you know, you take out the, you know, you definitely don't want to
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:10.240]   put the rubber stopper in the, in the cube lock with this. So it's a, to actually make the booster
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:16.480]   is as simple as this. The longest thing that takes the longest amount of time is doing all the research
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.720]   to figure out what are you going to put in that booster? What are all the recommended,
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:26.640]   you know, substances that are going to kind of do whatever your objective is for your booster,
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.840]   and then, you know, and then collecting them all. But really, once you've got them in this,
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:37.120]   then it's as simple as this. The, the cube lock over here, it only takes three minutes to,
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:42.800]   to burn the frequencies, the molecular frequencies of these, of these, uh, you know,
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:48.320]   these substances over to, uh, to aluminum card, which is what I use. So I use these little aluminum
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.360]   cards and I burn the frequency onto the card. So I'm going to have to take the cover off the C60
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:25:02.960]   and I'll show you in a sec. Hard to talk when I'm doing that. So this is what, this is how you do it.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:09.840]   You place the, and glass is no problem. Uh, you place the, the substances in the cube lock. So
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:15.520]   this is the energy booster. Then you put your, whatever you want to put the frequency into,
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:20.880]   which in this case would be these aluminum cards, right? And then you just set the timer and the
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:26.640]   timer is just, uh, the timer now on, while the timing is one to two minutes, three minutes max,
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:33.040]   um, you know, per the website and per the instruction. So I just go for a full, a full three minutes
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.680]   so that I know that everything that's in there, all of the different substances in the cube lock
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:43.520]   right now are going to burn into the glass, right? And into those cards. So you never want to use
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:49.040]   the same class because I did all of those other boosters in the past. That's why I put all those
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.240]   away. And these are all brand new glasses out of a fresh case of those jars. That's why you kind of
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.640]   just kind of have to dedicate. Once you use a jar for one of these, you dedicate that jar forever,
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:04.960]   never for that specific booster. You cannot put, uh, you know, I cannot burn everything in that
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:10.240]   this glass right here and then use that glass again for the allergy. Okay, you can't do that. So,
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.920]   because what you're doing is you're burning the frequencies, the molecular frequencies of the
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   substances into whatever's inside the cube lock. So the glass picks it up, the and the cards will
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.800]   pick it up. So then, uh, within another couple of minutes, uh, then the burning, you know, the
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:30.400]   charging of the, of the frequencies into the cards and the glass will be done. I'll take the cards out
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:35.520]   and then I've got, I basically use these, um, envelopes and I label the cards so that I don't
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.920]   forget what cards are what. Uh, and then I move on and I do the next one. And that's as simple as
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.960]   it gets. Uh, and it only takes three minutes and that's how you end up with, uh, you know, a burnt
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:50.800]   frequency card. And then that card then has the purposes, as I mentioned earlier, uh, you could use
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.760]   it either as a something that's, uh, you know, uh, just, you can use it if you have a cube lock to
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.640]   create other objects. Like you could use it to create pendants. You could use it to, uh, charge
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.560]   water. You could use it to do all sorts of different things, including put it into the field and
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:09.760]   having it emanate through the field. Um, and also you can use it for quantum entanglement type of things.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.240]   So that's what the frequency does. But if you actually wanted to experience the energy frequency,
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:19.680]   though, the cards do not carry a lot of energy in terms of strength. So you're better off using
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:24.160]   the frequency and then burning it in to a capsule. If you have a cube lock and that's kind of like
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:30.560]   why, uh, the men and women's frequency on Layla Q's website, they're offered on a card. If you have
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.880]   a block and you want to just move it around, you know, move it to different objects or it's offered
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:40.080]   as a pendant. And then you can then have that, that pendant. And that would be the, the thing
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.480]   that would have enough energy to kind of help your body. Uh, you know, you could do your whole body,
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.680]   uh, would, would benefit from the frequency. So cards really aren't meant for, uh, you know,
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.720]   like, you know, basically exposing your whole body to something. Uh, they're meant for mostly just,
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.280]   you know, transporting the frequency. So it's really important, uh, that you keep that in mind.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.240]   So if you actually want to experience a frequency, uh, you need to, you know, you're better off with
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:09.760]   a pendant with that frequency in it. Um, or, uh, and you know, you can just have a pendant and you
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:15.200]   could use one of these cards and you could take the, the spheres out of the pendant with the card,
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.280]   make a little piece of foil and that foil will then pick up the frequency and you can add that
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:25.040]   to your pendant. So you still definitely get a card and a pendant. Oh, there we go. So the timer's
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:31.840]   off and done. These cards are now, I mean, it doesn't look like it, but these cards are now the
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:37.120]   energy booster. So, uh, that's that one. And that's as easy as it gets. It really is that easy.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:42.240]   You take out the substances and I'm done. You don't have to wait any longer than a
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.240]   minute or so. And then you put in the next one and then you're done. So that's it. That's how
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:51.280]   you burn boosters and, uh, and the way I do it, uh, to keep organized and so forth. All right.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:57.200]   Thanks. That was it. So, you know, it's really is that simple and I just wanted to kind of share
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.680]   all of this with you. Uh, like again, we're have the new energy, the new allergy boosters working
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.480]   on the cardio. I actually have a bunch of new ideas as well. Uh, just doing them a few at a time.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.960]   You know, it's not cheap. Uh, but you know, the whole idea though is that I kind of create these
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:15.200]   things for myself. Uh, and then I've just started recently thinking, you know, I just, you know,
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.880]   trying to help other folks. So that's kind of what like, I don't have any allergies at all, but I,
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.960]   you know, people talk about it in the telegram chat groups. I'm like, Oh, go ahead and make a
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.640]   allergy booster. And then this cardio thing just came up yesterday. I was just kind of like,
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.280]   hey, there's an idea I never thought about, right? So, uh, but that's the idea of the boosters. So,
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.280]   you know, I encourage you guys make your own boosters. If you want to try the ones I make,
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.040]   you know, hey, awesome. Uh, and then, you know, there's all those, and then there's those other
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:43.680]   frequencies, those etheric frequencies that are offered by Layla, uh, are, are incredible. I don't
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:48.240]   know if anyone heard, have you've heard about the new weight loss frequency, uh, that Layla has,
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:53.360]   and I've been, I was one of the beta testers, the testers for that frequency. And you know, it,
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:58.400]   it's pretty amazing. It works. Uh, it really does something where you just don't want to eat food
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.240]   anymore. It's really weird. Uh, but the new weight loss frequency is pretty awesome too. That just
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:06.880]   popped up on the site last week. So, anyway, these are the new boosters by Kay Elmer and the
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.040]   Tinkers Academy. And I just want to say thank you for watching my video. Uh, I really appreciate
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.320]   your time. I'm really happy that you're interested in this kind of stuff. And, and you know,
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.240]   it just kind of encourages me and everyone else to keep doing it. So make your own boosters,
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.800]   come up with what you think could be beneficial for you, your life, your pets, your house, your plants,
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:27.680]   you know, all of this is just going to be, it's just, it's just an amazing positive thing.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.280]   And thank you for being part of it. Thank you for spending time with me. Thank you for your kind
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:36.560]   words. And I really, really do appreciate, uh, your interest in this subject. And it's, you know,
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:41.200]   we're all in this together. So, and I don't mean that in the stupid MSM way, but you know what I'm
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:46.160]   saying. So we're, we're, we're, this is it. We're humanity. Okay. We are humanity. So, uh, if you
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:50.880]   want to learn more about what I do and all the crazy tinkering that I, I'm doing all the time, I,
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:56.320]   I've documented it on the Tinkers Academy blog. And you can just go and type in tinkers.academy
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:02.800]   in your URL window. And it takes you right to the blog. And so lastly, thank you again, uh, for your
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.600]   time this, uh, today now and appreciate you stopping by. Aloha.
