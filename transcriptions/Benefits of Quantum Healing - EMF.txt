[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another tinker's academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.440]   Kay Elmer and in this video it's another installment on the series
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.000]   benefits of quantum healing with a focus on EMF which is electromagnetic
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.500]   frequency otherwise known as electro smog. So what I'd like to do today is
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.560]   share with you three separate studies that have been conducted on quantum
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.240]   energy as it relates to Wi-Fi exposure in human beings. They're fascinating
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.400]   studies, interesting results, and so let's just jump right into the studies.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.520]   The first thing though before I get into that is I want to level set everyone on
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.000]   exactly what is EMF that's kind of confusing because it comes from all
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.240]   different things. So one of the first things that everyone should realize that
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.680]   EMF is radiation and it comes from everything. Everything from your
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.400]   appliances to cell phones to airplanes and you name it. And so what I try to
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.200]   just wanted to convey with you is that here's this kind of chart that shows
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.840]   the electromagnetic frequency bands that start everywhere from zero all the way
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.400]   up to super super super super high you know microwaves. And there and while we
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.800]   have kind of evolved over time where we are naturally you know have
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.600]   acclimated to some EMF bandwidths such as anything below 60 hertz and in this
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.440]   visible light frame here. You can kind of see where you know that as the chart
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.120]   depicts there are safe and beneficial electromagnetic frequencies as long as
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.160]   they're in the appropriate dosage at a super low ranges and in the visible light
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.480]   because you know for them for the millennia human beings have been living
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.920]   on earth and exposed to the actual EMF coming from the planet as well as
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.640]   coming from the sun and the environment around them. We have acclimated to it our
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.640]   physiology is able to handle that and it actually works really well with those
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.280]   frequencies. However where the problem comes is all of the man-made non ionizing
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.560]   and ionizing radiation that's coming from all these other electro waves that are
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.880]   coming from everything from power lines to you name it. And so that's where you've
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.400]   got this confusing thing about hey you know is EMF baddy is EMF good well it's
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.080]   good and bad but the thing you were going to worry about today is the bad stuff
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.640]   the stuff that comes from Wi-Fi cell phone towers and so forth. Now in terms
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.680]   of EMF mitigation and for the longest time you know how do you mitigate the
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.880]   negative effects of bad EMF. And so in the traditional sense and this is where I
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.520]   noticed a lot of people in the telegram group that are new to quantum healing
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.020]   are assuming that it works as in terms of blocking you know how does you know
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.200]   the device block you know EMF and that sort of thing and that's just
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.360]   absolutely not how it works. Traditionally if you wanted to protect
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.960]   yourself from bad EMF you would put up something you know we would call shielding
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.160]   or blocking literally physical shields either paint or some kind of
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.000]   materials you would put on the walls so that if you had a cell phone tower that
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.440]   near your home or if you had wiring that was releasing EMF all sorts of
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.480]   different things you literally could put shielding up to and including
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.000]   clothing that was able to block that kind of radiation coming into actually
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.560]   hitting your body. And so the actual shielding and blocking is the traditional
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.320]   way of mitigating the effective EMF onto your person which is using physical
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.880]   you know items. The second one is actual radiation treatment there are there
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.920]   you know if you take a look at the history of radiation whenever someone
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.480]   gets radiation poisoning there's a protocol by which you just load up on
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.360]   antioxidants because it creates you know radiation creates an oxidative stress
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.520]   so you would load up on antioxidants and so there is a way to actually take
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.200]   supplementation and eat the right kind of foods to kind of help your body
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.160]   mitigate the oxidative stress caused by that radiation. So those are the two
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.240]   ways that people to you know have for the length of time up until now have
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.280]   basically been trying to you know mitigate the negative effect and but now
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.080]   we've got this new thing we've got this new way of able you know of being able
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.040]   to kind of mitigate that effect so and it's called quantum mitigation and it's
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.160]   it's all about quantum healing which is the focus of this video which is how the
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.000]   effect of quantum energy can also mitigate the effect on the body. So at
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.880]   the end of the day on a level set when we're talking about quantum healing and
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.680]   EMF or quantum energy and EMF we are not talking about physically blocking any
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.160]   of those any of those harmful you know waves that are coming at you but instead
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.080]   it's actually acting on your body so it's not doing anything to the source it's
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.960]   not doing anything to the you know to the radiation itself it's actually doing
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.480]   something to your body in how it reacts to the radiation so that's the first
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   thing that's really important to kind of understand when it comes to energy
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.360]   medicine as it relates to EMF okay. So now the first one the first individual I
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.960]   like to highlight is Dr. Beverly Rubik there's two studies that she had been
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.080]   commissioned to do on the Layla products in terms of energy and you know against
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.040]   EMF exposure. So one of the things about Dr. Rubik is that she is an
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.360]   internationally well-known author and speaker and researcher on the effects of
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.240]   EMF and so she has a PhD in biophysics at University of California Berkeley
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.280]   president founder of Institute of Frontier Science professor Energy
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.160]   Medicine University and she's also a faculty member of the College of
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.640]   Integrated Integrated Medicine and Health at Sciences at Seabrook
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.960]   University. She's also the author of two books Life at the Edge of Science and
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.080]   the interrelationship between Mind and Matter. She is again an
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.200]   internationally recognized expert on EMF and so a while back I kind of ran
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.200]   across a podcast where she was talking about the effects of 5G and how this all
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.080]   started with these studies was I recommended you know heard of you know
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.720]   in terms of like hey I told Phillip hey you know what Phillip at Layla
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.200]   quant protect I told him about this incredible smart lady and then he went
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.120]   ahead and contacted her and commissioned her to do the studies so the very first
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.160]   study that was commissioned by using quantum energy on individuals exposed to
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.240]   Wi-Fi was rather small and as Phillip will tell you in his interviews when he
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.640]   talks about this particular study was she initially she was hesitant and
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.080]   skeptical and because she's such an academic that you know in terms of like
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.320]   you know quantum healing energy medicine you know to treat the effects of EMF and
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.080]   and so her the first study was it was kind of small it was only four people the
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.400]   title of the study that was published oh by the way I'm sorry everything I'm
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.240]   speaking about today there'll be links to in the video description below so links
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.480]   to the studies links to how you can learn more about Dr. Beverly Rubik and
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.480]   the other institutions so forth so if you want to know more just check the
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.680]   video description for links to all of this stuff so now the very first study was
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.960]   titled does Layla quantum block protect users from short-term exposure to
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.800]   microwave radiation from a 4G Wi-Fi router as observed using live blood
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.200]   microscopy and that was the title of the study the methods and procedures for this
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.280]   first study was simply using four healthy human subjects two males two females
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.920]   averaging 42 to 80 years of age with a mean average age of or mean sorry mean
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.920]   age of 63 years old and that what was interesting though is if you read the
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.800]   study she made a comment why she went and she selected participants who are
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.120]   middle-aged because in her research just to point out to all of you out there
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.920]   who are middle-aged or older she you know the research shows that the older you
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.080]   are the more susceptible you are to the negative effects of bad EMF all right so
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.520]   keep that in mind for you guys out there my age and older that you want to make
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.640]   sure that you know hey you know you should be more serious about this the
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.400]   older you get because it is way more harmful for you the older you get based
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.560]   on the research anyway these four people were exposed to microwave radiation from
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.640]   a Wi-Fi router placed in an adjacent room and their blood was examined using a
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.840]   dark-field microscopy so this is blood analysis using microscopes to
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.480]   basically evaluate the the structure of the cells the the fluidity of the blood
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.480]   flow white blood cell counts so forth and so what they did was they essentially
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:58.840]   took a sample of the individual's blood prior to exposure to Wi-Fi and then they
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.000]   took it after 10 minutes after they've been exposed to the Wi-Fi router in an
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.600]   adjacent room so they you know it was turned off when they got there turned it
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.160]   on then they took after 10 minutes they took a sample and then they basically
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:15.400]   then had the participants put their hands in a cue block a cue block quantum
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.520]   block from Leila quantum tech for 10 minutes while the router was running and
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.400]   so what I want to point out here and that's just really it you know one two
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.880]   three but what's really really important was that this study was done with a sham
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.000]   block what Leila quantum tech actually provided to Dr. Rubik was an actual
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.240]   quantum block and then another block that was never charged was just basically
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.960]   metal and rods but one was an actual quantum block that had been charged with
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.800]   quantum energy and one was a neutral one that had no energy whatsoever so they
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.600]   were she was given a sham block so everybody did it multiple times either
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.720]   and you know of course the participants didn't know that they were using the
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   fake block or that you know I would call it the non-charged block versus the
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.280]   charged block right and so they you know it's all of this was done double blind
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.960]   and so forth and so that's how the that's how this study went and so the
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.600]   results of the study was and this is the conclusion of Dr. Rubik was that the
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.280]   active quantum block which was device B and there was AA is the sham device B
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.640]   was the charged one okay so the charged one the real quantum block the one you
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.880]   could buy right off the website showed a clear protective effect in preventing
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.120]   the red blood cells from sticking together reducing early fibrin formation
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:29.000]   and increasing white blood cell motility which is and I'll get into that a bit
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.120]   more but that's very very very good and so now I just again want to point out
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.920]   that the study was a randomized double blind sham controlled study which is the
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.160]   gold standard of clinical medical research as of highly professional
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.480]   clinicians here doing what they normally do regardless of what they're testing
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.840]   so highly reputable so now if you take a look at the actual results from these
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:55.040]   four individuals and this is an aggregate of you know multiple exposures
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.840]   bottom line those if you take a look at these five distinct categories that
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.480]   were measured studying their blood with exposure only so that's these people
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.240]   that you know basically you know sitting in a room with the Wi-Fi on and then
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.560]   exposure with their hands in the quantum block you know being you know having
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.680]   quantum energy you know applied and so here we go about some bottom line is
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.160]   Rolo which is a French term for rolling a coin roll which is when you take a
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.120]   look at red blood cells they'll tend to kind of clump together either as either
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:32.240]   as a what they call an aggregate clump or the you know Rolo formation which is
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.960]   like a coin roll and so when your blood I'm sorry your red blood cells clumped
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:43.200]   together the problem that you have is a lower oxygenation of the blood so you
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.720]   know red blood cells carry oxygen to your cells and so you get less oxygen and
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:53.200]   as the cells clumped together it's not good for your body creates stress
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.160]   inflammation and so forth and so you can see where when somebody is exposed or
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.280]   when the participants in general were exposed their their measurement of the
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.880]   amount of Rolo formations and aggregate clumping of their blood cells was quite
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.960]   high and then when in the red is once they were exposed to quantum energy it
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:18.040]   decreased significantly so we're talking about major decreases in the Rolo
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.160]   formation of the blood cells and red blood cells aggregate clumping and so
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.200]   forth now the member distribution or what they call membrane disturbances and
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.040]   irregularity irregularities of shape so they also evaluated the shape of the
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.920]   cells you know unhealthy cells will not be perfectly round like the little
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.120]   hockey pucks that they are you know they become mutated and so forth because
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.560]   radiation mutates cells right it's it's all about electrons and stuff like that
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.360]   I won't go there but bottom line though it begins to mutate your so at you at a
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.520]   cellular level and so it's no longer round so they look for the irregularities of
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.720]   the shape of the red blood cells and they also look at fibrin the fibrin
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   formation and what's really really important I think this is a an issue of
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.080]   our of our generation is the concept of blood clotting well fibrin is what
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.200]   happens that's what causes blood clots it's fibrin is a fibrosis non globular
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.680]   protein involved in the clotting of blood so your body will start forming
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:20.040]   fibrins when exposed to radiation which causes blood clotting right and look
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:23.640]   what happens this is blue is when they're exposed without quantum energy and in
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.720]   the red is when they're exposed to quantum energy the decrease in the amount of
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.720]   fibrin found in the blood which is significant and very remarkable the
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.720]   lastly here's the white blood count white blood cell activity which is huge
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.160]   because now another thing that radiation does is it destroys and well it doesn't
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.960]   destroy it it attempts to destroy your immune system and you're part of your
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.520]   immune system is your white blood cells they're the little cells in your blood
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.600]   stream that run around and gobble up all the pathogens and so if you don't
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.520]   have enough white blood cells then you know you basically have a negative or
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.780]   immune disorder immune problem and you don't you can't fight off illnesses
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.840]   disease and so forth and so what was fascinating I think out of the study of
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:11.840]   what quantum energy does to blood in the in in in relation to the exposure to
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:17.520]   radiation was that it increases white blood cells in the body which is quite
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.840]   remarkable if you think about how quantum energy would translate to
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.840]   causing your body to create more white blood cells to help and boost your
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.720]   immune system so that was an amazing finding only for people and you know
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.880]   honestly if you hear Philip talk about it you will know that you know they
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.480]   dr. Rubik was very very surprised this was the first time in her career that she'd
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:44.680]   actually run into this ie using quantum energy for EMF mitigation so she was
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:49.120]   happy to actually do another study where she wanted to even study it further so
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.160]   the second study that dr. Rubik did was called Leila Quantum Block shows
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.520]   protective effects on blood upon human exposure to short-term Wi-Fi radiation
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.360]   this was done in January of 2022 now the methods and procedures in the second
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:07.000]   study was pretty much the same as the first just expanded to involve 12 people
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.200]   instead of four kind of wanted to get more people involved to see you know
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.680]   is this a quirk about just these four people let's times you know let's do
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.600]   three times as many people so of the 12 healthy human subjects there were three
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.120]   males nine females range for eight anywhere from 42 to 80 years of age with
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:30.480]   the mean age of 62 now they were also exposed to radiation but but from a
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.480]   microwave as opposed to I'm sorry microwave radiation from a Wi-Fi router
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:40.360]   so again they had another Wi-Fi router situated two meters from them all right
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.440]   so same protocol they came in taking a take a snapshot of their blood turn on
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.200]   the Wi-Fi router take a snapshot of their blood and then then they would
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.280]   basically again they would get another 10 minutes here again 10 minutes 10
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.920]   minutes and then they would get 10 minutes with a quantum block they put
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.960]   their hands inside of it and then they would take a snapshot of their blood so
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.760]   that's really kind of the same procedure as the first one which is 12 instead of
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:09.600]   four people the results again were quite remarkable so the very first thing that
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.560]   in the study that you'll read in terms of results is that the blood showed
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.360]   significant adverse changes following 10 minutes of subject exposure so you
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.440]   know obviously you know you want to as a control you want to basically expose
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.480]   everybody to Wi-Fi without quantum energy and so you know they proved in
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:31.400]   this study that you know Wi-Fi radiation negatively affects your the health of
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.640]   your blood I want everyone out there in the world who knows you know look across
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.440]   your living room whatever you've got a Wi-Fi router and that thing right there
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:44.400]   is causing you to have unhealthy blood all right so now and then this is the
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.840]   study proves it however exposure to the quantum block compared to the sham device
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.080]   again they were using the sham block showed a statistically significant
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.400]   protective effect on the blood well beyond the sham right so obviously the
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.480]   sham is not charged so so bottom line again with the same results so now she's
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.520]   done the study twice got the same results twice where the quantum block impacted
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.840]   the blood of all subjects positively and furthermore positively impacted all
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:16.120]   readily observable effects adverse readily observable adverse effects of
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.840]   the radiation radiation on the blood so in conclusion human exposure to
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.400]   radiation from Wi-Fi routers produce adverse changes in the morphology of their
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:29.120]   blood that are clearly observable using an octagonal microscope you know dark
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:34.080]   field microscopy so quantum blocks showed a robust protective effect against
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:39.960]   these adverse blood changes so you know again incredibly remarkable on on the
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.200]   effects of you know quantum energy quantum healing in terms of how it heals
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.440]   and helps you when exposed to a bad EMF radiation and again this was a
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.040]   randomized single blind sham control trial to look for that protective effect
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.480]   okay it's a gold standard in clinical research so here now the second study was
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.440]   quite remarkable because she was able to share the actual snapshots of the
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.400]   individuals of blood so this is one of the participants where at baseline you
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.280]   can kind of see where the individual had some low formations right here you can
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.080]   see the coin rolls you can see some aggregate clumping and so forth and then
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.800]   when they expose them this is this is where everyone should pay attention here
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.560]   when exposed to Wi-Fi without any quantum energy in the room you can see
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.520]   what immediately happened to there's just ten minutes what happened to the
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.800]   individuals of blood all of the red blood cells just stuck together formed a
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:36.960]   giant clump in both types of formations and the Fibrin you know and basically a
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:43.440]   fibrin protein started to you know started to grow very very unhealthy can
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.400]   you imagine what would happen to you if you if this was permanent but then ten
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.440]   minutes with their hands in the Q-block their blood cells decoupled and became
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.220]   free-roaming and the the shapes of the of the blood cells etc as I described
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.360]   earlier everything approved if you take a look at the actual you know
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:05.360]   measurements from EMF's the second EMF study again you've got an incredible
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.260]   decrease now this is the colors are reversed in this one red is where they
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.880]   were exposed blue is when the quantum energy was applied you can see the
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:17.320]   incredible decrease in the rule of formations and the aggregate clumping
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:22.520]   the blood immediately improved in terms of you know of just you know you know
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.820]   motility right and then we talk about what your white blood cell count increased
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.140]   the Fibrin's went down and the membrane distribution went that went down as
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.180]   well so again we've got similar results two separate studies to you know two
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:39.140]   different groups of people done by internationally renowned EMF experts so
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.780]   this is quite remarkable in terms of actual studies demonstrating the effects
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.340]   the benefits of quantum healing on EMF so now the second set of study the
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.900]   second study that I pulled out was done done by a group called the International
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.940]   Society for Electoral Smog Research and their their acronym is I-G-E-F so I-Gef
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:05.420]   now to you know this this group as like Dr. Rubik is an American and we're a
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.540]   majority of her you know research is in America but she's internationally well
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:14.260]   known this international or I-Gef is known in Europe and so they're a
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.940]   international society they're in an international association of scientists
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.740]   doctors engineers technicians and experts who have been investigating the
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.460]   effects of electro smog or EMF pollution on people's animals nature in the
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:30.660]   environment since 1990 okay they don't and this is what's really you know I
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.340]   think promising or I think reputable about them is that they do not depend on
[00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.380]   any economic political or religious or any other interest group so they're like
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:43.740]   the consumer reports on EMF and they're like the big wigs in Europe on this
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.460]   particular subject so think about it from that standpoint you know and what they
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.340]   do as you know they're like the gold standard you know you know seal over
[00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:56.180]   approval kind they basically you know them and their research partners all
[00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:00.100]   examined they do everything from products systems and buildings where they
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.660]   actually evaluate the protective properties and you know again you know
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.460]   these products and so forth they're protective properties against electro
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.820]   smog so getting a certification from I-Gef is a really big deal because these
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:17.220]   individuals are so well known in terms of being a literally an industry expert
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:22.260]   or subject matter experts on the you know on on an electro smog and EM bad EMF and
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:26.940]   and all the different products so what Leila quant protected was commissioned
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:32.420]   them to do a study on the heel capsule and so and you know and how it would
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:37.420]   help mitigate the negative effects of EMF radiation on on people so the study
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:42.420]   here that the I-Gef had had conducted was titled examination of the Leila
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.540]   quantum in heel capsule with regard to the protective effect against
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.940]   electromagnetic radiation exposure and this was done in December 2020 the
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.660]   methods of this study was the Leila quantum and heel capsule was tested on
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:58.980]   12 subjects both sexes age between 12 and 80 years old in different living and
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:04.940]   working in situations so basically 12 people from society and every one of
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.740]   them had a different you know kind of like environmental background you know
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.220]   and I'm just guessing but I'm assuming some people lived in houses some people
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.940]   lived in buildings some people worked some people you know but bottom line was
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.380]   12 people right out of society who all had all these different levels of
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.740]   exposure to EMF and what they wanted to know is they wanted to know hey well you
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.580]   know if you know we all all of us there's none of us that don't have any EMF in
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:33.660]   our life we all are exposed to EMF the good and the bad and so we're all exposed
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.540]   to bad so they to randomly take 12 people and then they wanted to study them
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:43.540]   in terms of okay well how you know how how are you as a biological organism
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:49.220]   able to mitigate and or you know adjust yourself and to all of the
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:53.620]   electro smog all the EMF around you okay and so they then how they wanted to
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.300]   measure it was they wanted to use heart rate variability was chosen as a
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:02.340]   diagnostic systems system for analyzing the vegetative nervous system in order
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.820]   to investigate whether the Leila quantum heel capsule leads to an
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.820]   improvement in heart rate variability and test subjects so that was their means
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:14.820]   to measure as Rubik had used the dark field microscopy I guess had used heart
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.980]   rate variability so now what that is is heart rate variability is a cycle or
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:23.580]   physiological phenomenon of variation in time interviews between heart beats
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.180]   and so it's basically these machines are like three grand I kind of looked into
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.260]   it because I wanted to play with one but bottom line is you know if you measure
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:37.660]   an individual's heart rate variability basically high is good low is bad in
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.820]   terms of your health and so this was you know then this is actually you know a
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:46.020]   gold standard measurement for health I think you know everyone's like smart
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.620]   watches and fibbits and all those things actually measure heart rate
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.700]   variability as well at this stage so that's how they did it they took 12
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.940]   people and they measured their heart rate variability in their natural
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.620]   environments and then they gave them a heel capsule and then they say hey what
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.140]   you know what changed and so here's what the results were the results of the
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:09.620]   iGAF caps heel capsule emf study was in seven of the 12 test subjects the
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:13.860]   ability to regulate the heart rate and to adapt the autonomic nervous system
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.780]   to the electromagnetic environment that they lived in clearly improved after
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:24.020]   using a Leila quantum heel capsule for only a few hours four of the 12 test
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.660]   subjects showed an improvement in the ability to regulate the heart rate and
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.920]   to adapt you know they're an autonomic nervous system the electromagnetic
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.220]   environmental stress was only achieved after several days and then one of the
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:43.020]   12 test persons using the capsule did not visibly improve any you know the
[00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.500]   ability to regulate their heart and adapt their nervous system to the to
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:51.580]   the electromagnetic pollution so it's quite interesting that seven could in a
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:56.140]   few hours four in a few days but one you know was there was there was no
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.820]   noticeable change in their heart rate variability so they kind of kind of and
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.980]   what so what iGAF did because you know this they've been doing this since 1990
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.500]   they basically quantified the results by saying the measurement results show
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.900]   that the protective effect of Leila quantum heel capsule increases with the
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.980]   duration of use and that each person reacts differently to the electromagnetic
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.900]   pollution occurring in their environment this depends on their predispositions
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:26.940]   possible pre-existing conditions existing health problems their immune status and
[00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.500]   the ability of their organism to compensate for the stresses that occur
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:35.100]   as well as the resistance to internal or I'm sorry external influences the
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.100]   negative effects of using the Leila quantum heel capsule were not observed
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:43.980]   during the test phase and were not reported by test subjects so basically
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:49.260]   in summary you know we're all different we all have different levels of exposure
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:53.940]   to bad EMF and we all have different health conditions and depending on how
[00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:57.780]   healthy you are and how much you're exposed you're gonna get a much better
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:02.100]   effect you know with the least the least I'm sorry the more healthy you are and
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.460]   the less exposure you know it's this common sense you're gonna have a way
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:11.300]   more positive effect or benefit from quantum healing as regards to EMF but
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:15.740]   then as you are you know the less the lesser your health condition the more
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.980]   exposure you are it's gonna take longer for the energy to kick in and begin to
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.540]   help you and then if you're just too far gone you know it implies you know this
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.140]   is important I think it implies it you know if you're really really really
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:34.860]   massively exposed to EMF and your health is really poor quantum energy your
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:39.740]   quantum healing may not help you just by itself and I think that's something
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.300]   that's really important again though however when you take a look at the
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:49.140]   results you know we're talking 11 out of the 12 I mean clearly 11 out of 12 were
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:54.060]   been observed they observed heart rate availability improvement and they were
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:57.860]   benefited by the quantum healing from wearing the keel capsule so that was
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.900]   wearing it on their person so you know this raises and that's the end of this
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.420]   one so this raises the idea that everybody is going to be different you
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.980]   know in terms of exposure so I think one of the things that's really important
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.060]   is when you start thinking about you know how do I leverage quantum energy
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:17.220]   tools to help me you help my health you know against the negative effects of
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:22.860]   bad EMF one of the things you really need to think about is the severity of
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.980]   your exposure you know your personal exposure I mean you take a look at all
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:30.480]   of the different factors that can cause EMF would you know being in an airplane
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.860]   you know we've got EMF coming in from satellites now with the Starlink network
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.580]   which is beaming you know 5g across the planet at this point with satellites
[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:45.300]   everything from laptops cellular devices cellular you know a microwave towers is
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.820]   really bad being inside of buildings is really bad you know even in your own
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:54.100]   home you know with the Wi-Fi router inside your house all your all your
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:58.700]   various appliances and so forth and everything to include transmission lines
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:02.140]   you're looking around and are all close are you to transformer stations power
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.780]   lines so forth of course you've got TV broadcasting and then again you know
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:10.540]   your proximity to airports is something everyone should be considering as well
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.740]   because you know all the different electronics that they're beaming out
[00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:18.380]   you know with all the radars and so forth so that is a something you know
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:23.380]   when you think about you know the effects of bad EMF you need to think
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:28.260]   about the severity of your exposure to that EMF and then kind of you know adapt
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:33.740]   to that based on your severity so you think about how bad are you exposed and
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:37.940]   then you want to try to do the most you can depending on that severity you
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:42.100]   know when you're talking about the quantum healing effect and what types
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:46.420]   of tools that you want to use and I think that's what I you know the iGef
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:50.140]   study sort of pointed out you know that based on individuals you know
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.580]   depending on how how they lived what their environment was you know it made
[00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:58.220]   a difference in terms of how quickly the quantum healing effects kicked in and
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.820]   especially you know and then they also mentioned the pre-existing condition so
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:07.300]   you know if you are in you know whatever level of health you're in and you're
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.220]   you know let's say if you're already in poor health and you're being subjected
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.940]   to EMF then you're gonna be a lot you know you're gonna need a lot more help
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:18.980]   in terms of mitigation as opposed to someone who's in great health and not
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.660]   exposed too much you know like somebody living on a farm and being really
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:26.380]   healthy you know would be the direct opposite of somebody who is unhealthy
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.260]   and living in the middle of a city near airports and so forth so it's just
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.620]   something to think about you need and and that's the first thing when you're
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:35.700]   trying to say hey you know what you know how do I want to leverage this
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:40.260]   technology to help my health in regards to EMF so that's the first thing you
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:44.380]   want to think about is you know how severe are you being exposed to it and
[00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:49.060]   again what your pre-existing conditions are and then what you then will then
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:54.340]   take a look at in terms of you know using Lele Q for EMF and let's just
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.100]   talk about the different products and the services so you can kind of get an
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:01.340]   idea of the different range you know of you know like moderate and minor to
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:06.260]   moderate exposure to severe exposure and then you know what you can do against
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.020]   those specific types of you know severity right so the first thing you
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.380]   know when you look at the different options that are available to you for
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:19.780]   quantum devices specifically from Lele quantum tech you know they sell you
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:24.820]   know and quantum energy in the embedded into metal cards and the cards
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:29.580]   mostly carry or all of them carry except for one a frequency so you've got a
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:35.060]   combination of quantum energy itself and a frequency embedded in the card
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:40.660]   itself now the capsules themselves are the same they have quantum energy and
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.260]   you know they're charged with quantum energy and they also carry frequency the
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:48.740]   blocks have no frequency and the upgrade comes with either just energy and or
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.620]   you could add frequencies to it so there's a little bit of a combination and how
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:57.020]   these combinations work let me go ahead and explain that to you the first thing
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:02.180]   is proximity and so to these devices that you want to consider so just like
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:09.220]   the the dr. Rubik studies where she only exposed people to just quantum energy
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:13.060]   you know which was through the quantum block and then if you take a look at the
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:18.020]   iGAF study they use the heel capsule so they use the device that had frequency
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:21.860]   which was the heel frequency and the other components within that frequency
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:26.580]   and also they use quantum energy so there was like a kind of a you know like a
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:31.340]   double effect right there using a heel capsule as opposed to a block because a
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.860]   block is just quantum energy so just something to think about because they are
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:39.100]   a little different however the main thing about anything that's charged with
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.140]   quantum energy and all of the products at Leila Q and the service itself is
[00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:48.700]   quantum energy that energy is basically kind of comes in a field even if you've
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:53.020]   subscribed to the quantum upgrade service you're basically having a through you
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:57.260]   know quantum entanglement you're actually having quantum energy sent to you and it
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.460]   creates a bubble around you can reach or you know whatever you subscribe to so if
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:05.500]   you have a a u subscription as you personally or your pets your house your
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:10.060]   car your cell phone but that the specific item that you send you know or
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:13.620]   person or pet that you send that energy to through the upgrade service will be
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:18.180]   based in quantum energy so you get these benefits from that and so just you know
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:23.140]   as as shown in the Dr. Rubik studies so the idea here is if there's a field
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:29.900]   right and the thing about the field is proximity so the cards now every one of
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:34.460]   these items into cars as well has a quantum energy field you know it's
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:39.380]   basically a charged item and it emits energy and then energy has a limitation
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.860]   you know it's only so you know how far does it go and so that's what the idea
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:49.180]   behind field size comes into play so a card if you were to buy a frequency card
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:55.180]   it has a field around it around eight centimeters or four inches and so if you
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.340]   want to benefit from the energy and the frequency of the card you're going to
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:02.260]   want to keep it within that four inch rate you know you know basically four
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:06.500]   inch you know away from you is the maximum you're going to want to keep it
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.340]   away from you but if you really want to benefit from it you want to have it as
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:12.580]   close to you as possible because it is such a small field you know it's a
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:18.220]   smallest quantum device that is provided so you definitely want to have a if you
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:23.140]   use a card you want to have it on your person right close to your skin you know
[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:27.060]   in a pocket or you know like around your neck through a lanyard or so forth and
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.860]   you want to keep it really close because the field is so small okay so that's
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:33.420]   really important to keep in mind now for capsules and that's the heel capsule
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.300]   as well as the men's and women's booster capsule they're all the same they're
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.260]   all you know they're all charged with quantum energy they all have different
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.780]   frequencies but in terms of quantum they all have the same level of quantum
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:49.060]   energy and the capsules themselves have a six foot you know diameter energy
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:52.460]   field and so obviously you're you know just carrying it around your neck or
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:56.940]   in your pocket is quite you know is is is you know is substantial level of
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.380]   energy and then you'll be able to benefit from that mitigating effect you
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:05.100]   know for that the emf so definitely within six feet so again proximity you
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.060]   want to keep it close to you or in your pocket but you know you don't want to
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.860]   you know like like for there's a lot of parents out there and they're worried
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.780]   about their kids losing their things right and so some say well I'll put it
[00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:16.100]   in their backpack but you know if you put it in a backpack or if you're
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.060]   someone who carries a purse or a satchel you know if you set that thing
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:24.020]   down and you're more than six feet away or four feet away you know you're not
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:27.140]   getting as much benefit if you carry on your person that's my point you want to
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.980]   be close to it now the blocks vary because each one of the blocks has a
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:35.100]   different energy level and so what I want and what I want to do is kind of
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:39.740]   just show you this diagram and this is something that Philip had kind of been
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:44.740]   analyzing with Roman to try to identify like where in that field of a block
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:49.260]   because the blocks field are so large you know quantum block is literally
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:55.580]   130 feet a con infinity block the field size can be you know can be as large as
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.380]   a kilometer or more if you upgrade it so you know we're talking about kilometers
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:05.260]   almost basically what is it a half a mile right so it's quite a large field and
[00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:09.420]   so where in that field of an infinity block or a quantum block or so forth
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.940]   travel blocks similar to an infinity block that you're going to want to
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:18.260]   basically have positioned in your home or you know around you to get that
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:23.020]   benefit of quantum healing for EMF so what they have determined is that while
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:26.900]   the field is for blocks this is very specific to blocks now while the field
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:31.820]   as depicted by this outer circle is x-large right is this you know how big
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.500]   what they've determined is that the EMF effect is really most pronounced within
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:40.140]   the 40% of that field so as just an example let's say just I'm just going
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:44.260]   to round up let's say if that's a quantum block it's 130 feet so let's just say
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:51.020]   130 feet is the size of that field and within that first right 40% of it let's
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:55.780]   say I'm not going to do the math in my head real quick but let's say whatever
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:35:00.500]   40% of 130 whatever I have to top my head it's going to be x right and then that
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:05.340]   x distance to the quantum block specifically or any block actually that
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:10.980]   40% where the block is in the center and within that 40 foot diameter around the
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.700]   block because these energy fields project out to 360 degrees in every
[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:19.580]   direction you're going to want to be within that 40% of that field and that's
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:23.340]   where you're going to get the benefits of quantum healing as a related EMF okay
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:28.060]   so it's really important that when you think about EMF and blocks that you're
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:32.260]   going to want to be within that 40% of the field okay now when you talk about
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:36.140]   the upgrade again you know it's being it's literally being transmitted to you
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:40.220]   and you are you your whole person's covered with it and your pets and so
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:46.580]   forth for EMF I did check with Philip and they haven't tested the field for you
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:50.940]   know like the quantum upgrade service for house car and sell just yet to kind
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.340]   of determine whether or not you know like you know exactly how that applies to
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:58.500]   the EMF area Philip it'll be checking with Roman here in the next week or so
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.980]   and getting back to me I'll post that in the telegram chat group when we get
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:06.340]   I'm sure Philip will to kind of just let everybody know for the upgrade service
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:11.100]   you know how does the EMF mitigation work for those specific subscriptions okay so
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:16.300]   but what we do know is that if it's a you or pet subscription then you will get
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.220]   the full benefit of quantum healing as for EMF now if it's house car and phone
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:25.380]   stay tuned we'll know more about that in in a short while okay so that's the
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:31.740]   that's your basic Leila device as it relates to you know EMF and if you want
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:36.060]   that EMF protection now if you are again you know I want to point out if you are
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:39.900]   living in a city you live in a building you work in a building you know you're
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.540]   near an airport all that kind of stuff near power lines and so forth you're
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.260]   gonna have quite a bit more EMF than the normal person and so then you know
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.860]   there's a way that you could level up you can actually do more and that's kind of
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:54.260]   what the products have been designed to do is actually you know provide the
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:37:00.380]   basic level of protection and then if you want and or need to you can level up
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:04.820]   and actually add more protection to that you know if you're in an environment
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:09.580]   that you know is basically way more harmful than than a normal environment
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.100]   and so just by the way I really want to stress that you know when you take a look
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:18.660]   at the Dr. Rubik study the first one the Wi-Fi router was in another room and
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.300]   you saw what happened to those individuals and then the second one the
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:26.660]   Wi-Fi router was in the room and I think most people we keep our Wi-Fi
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:31.820]   routers usually in our living rooms right and so you're in that room with it
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:35.460]   and you can see I mean right off the bat I mean you know if this study proved
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:39.180]   anything is that the minute that you are exposed your blood just clumps
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:44.100]   together and you immediately get low low oxygen and that low oxygen throughout
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:48.100]   your body is going to have a really detrimental effect on your cellular
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:51.980]   you know structures and also you know that's going to create inflammation
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:55.380]   blah blah blah and you're going to it's problematic and it's very very bad for
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:00.100]   your health so now if you are in that type of an environment then you're going
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.020]   to want to maybe level up and that's my recommendation so the idea here now
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:07.740]   that Leila has provided and this is something that you know anyone can go out
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.900]   and do which is you know getting EMF clothing so EMF clothing just right off
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:18.700]   the bat is when you talk about the different types of mitigation EMF
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:23.340]   clothing is right in here it is actual shielding okay so all of the EMF
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:27.540]   clothing that's on the market today what it is is actually been embedded with
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:33.900]   metal fibers within the within the cloth itself and those metal fibers act as a
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:39.300]   shield against a physical shield against EMF radiation okay so if you just get
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:44.100]   regular EMF clothing that is a shield that you're wearing on your person that
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:48.300]   actually blocks literally blocking and shielding your physical you know being
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.300]   from the actual radiation the waves of the radiation so now what Leila has done
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:56.340]   is they've come up with their own clothing line of EMF clothing all right
[00:38:56.340 --> 00:39:01.460]   and so now you've got the benefit of actual shielding and on top of that
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.180]   they've taken their clothing and they've charged it with quantum energy and
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:08.820]   because of that metal thread in the clothing the metal is able to hold on to
[00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.580]   that quantum energy so you've got a quantum field and you've got shielding
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:16.620]   it's a double whammy and it's probably you know the most protection you can get
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:22.580]   from EMF is to actually wear this wear the clothing that's charged you know so
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:26.700]   if you have your own blocks you can easily go out and either purchase EMF
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:31.940]   charged EMF clothing at Leila or go and get EMF clothing or make your own you
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.740]   know there's there's you know people that out there that sell the material you
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:38.060]   can make your own you can buy your own up and then you could charge yourself or
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:41.220]   you could go and get the charge EMF clothing and then you're gonna have like
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:45.460]   pretty much the maximum benefit with one caveat and so that maximum benefit is
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:49.140]   gonna give you shielding and quantum healing you know quantum healing combined
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:53.820]   for people who have you know a high severity of exposure to EMF so the last
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:59.340]   thing that EM that Leila offers in terms of using quantum and frequency
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:04.940]   you know healing for EMF is they've you know for people who just are you
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:08.700]   know in a situation which they know that there's you know you're severely
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:13.620]   exposed you have air quantum devices and they are helping you you know it's
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:18.020]   demonstrated in the studies it's clear in the studies that it definitely assists
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:22.740]   your body with mitigating the negative effects on your blood deterioration and
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.700]   improving your heart rate variability okay so that's been proven in the study
[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:29.820]   so what's the next level up that you can do so you can add the quantum which
[00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.260]   will help and then you could also add a frequency so if you want to go with
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:38.100]   either the blocking shielded clothing plus quantum or you can actually add a
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:42.580]   frequency to your your device that then you can then even gives you more it
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:47.060]   gives you the quantum energy and a specific frequency that was developed to
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:51.380]   help your body even more you know in terms of mitigating that negative
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:56.340]   harmful physical negative effect of EMF and that's a frequency card that's sold
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:01.020]   called the EMF protection and harmonization frequency card now their the
[00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:05.460]   cards are a device and they're also you know the frequency in the card that you
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:09.540]   can then take that frequency if you have a block or if you have a capsule you can
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.820]   actually take the frequency off of the card and create a foil and add it to
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:17.740]   your capsule or just you know leave it in your block you know make a foil leave
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.740]   the foil in your block and then you can not only have the quantum energy in that
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:24.740]   block but you can also be then broadcasting that EMF protective frequency
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:30.500]   throughout the field and so that gives you even more benefit and more added
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.660]   you know added protection to help your body deal with that EMF so just keep
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:38.660]   that in mind based on your severity you know just right off the bat a normal
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:42.580]   person will definitely benefit from any of the basic products the cards capsules
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.700]   blocks in the upgrade service but if you want more and you feel that you know
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:50.460]   you know I'm in a really bad position where I live in a building work in a
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.340]   building near an airport you know that kind of thing then you're gonna want to
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:56.580]   level up and you're gonna want to do a little bit more if you're concerned about
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:00.100]   EMF and you definitely want to get that benefit of quantum healing so just keep
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.460]   that in mind okay that there's two levels right just normal and then you
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.860]   know I want a little bit more okay so that's what you can do if you want that
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:11.460]   little bit more to you know fully benefit from quantum healing to protect
[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:14.060]   yourself if you're in a severe environment so just keep that in mind I
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.860]   think it's really important that everybody is aware that there's you know
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:21.980]   two ways you can actually do more okay with quantum healing so there you go I'm
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.780]   really glad that you spent some time with me today thank you so much for
[00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:29.060]   watching this video I think it's so important for all of us because it's
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:34.140]   such a you know such a negative health effect of this bad EMF that you know
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.420]   that we're all subjected to and we just can't get away from anymore so you know
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.100]   thanks for watching this video really appreciate you taking the time I know
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.460]   your time is precious and you know thank you for watching the video and I
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:49.660]   really appreciate the kind comments that everybody provided and provides in the
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:53.740]   comment section now if you want to learn more about quantum energy and quantum
[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:57.700]   healing you know definitely you can go to the Leila quantum tech site video I'm
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:01.740]   sorry links in the video description below for Leila quantum tech as well as
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:05.540]   visit me on the Tinkers Academy that's my blog you just type in Tinkers.academy
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:09.300]   and you URL window on your browser and it comes right to my blog I've got a huge
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:13.140]   section dedicated to quantum energy and of course I've started a new series here
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:17.020]   called the benefits of quantum healing so again thank you so much for your time
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:20.820]   today and you know good health to you and I hope that you learned something and
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:24.580]   that you definitely can and help yourself and your family and your pet so
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:29.420]   thank you again and have a wonderful day Aloha
