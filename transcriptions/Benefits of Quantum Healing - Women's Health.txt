[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another tinker's academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and this
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.920]   video is another installment in the series benefits of quantum healing where I'm going over the
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.560]   science studies that have been commissioned by Layla quantum tech on the effects of quantum energy
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.760]   on various subjects. This particular study released in November of 2024 is on women's health. The
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.280]   specific study is called quantum upgrade study finals final report and the purpose of it was to
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.920]   study and evaluate the impact of quantum upgrade intervention on women's health using wearable
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.000]   device data and validated surveys. Now the actual principal investigator is a company called
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   reputable. It is a third party product research company specializing in the health industry
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.520]   using wearable powered health research technology that delivers unmatched real time data accuracy
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.680]   and affordability. And our all this is off of their website are all in one platform streamlines
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.440]   clinical trials by expertly managing study design recruitment data analysis and compliance
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.640]   ensuring your brand's claims are rigorous and research backed. Now some of the other clients
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.080]   that have been serviced by reputable is Hop new calm momenta skyview and of course Layla quantum
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.600]   tech. So essentially there are just a separate company that other companies will go and hire
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.760]   and have them do a test to say hey you know you know how how did our product perform you know in
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.600]   whatever category that they're you know looking at. So now the overall key findings of this study
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.680]   just right off the top is that in general the change in biomarker data trended in the right
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.120]   direction with the greatest improvements identified in heart rate variability time awake and average
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.120]   heart rate and then the key thing here is that this is a resting heart rate and it's statistically
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.560]   significant that it was definitely improved. The also another key finding was that the woman's
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.440]   health survey data yielded the most impressive outcomes in anxiety fear and sleep with statistically
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.680]   significant change in anxiety and fear. Lastly a key finding was that the participants reported
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.520]   quality of life yielded the greatest outcomes of all three dependent measures with statistically
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.680]   significant change in energy and fatigue emotional well-being general health role limitations
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.520]   associated with emotional problems social function and pain. So in a nutshell okay and this is all
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.600]   really great stuff. I mean it really is it's an amazing study because it's a simple before and
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.200]   after study so there was no placebo it was it was not double blind it was simply a before and after
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.640]   with and without quantum upgrade. There were 35 participants all women with a 74% completion
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.880]   rate. Now most studies you know they it's really impossible to get 100% of the people to you know
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.080]   make it through the entire study so one person had kind of withdrawn and a few others had just
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.720]   simply not turned in their homework. So there's only about 28 people that actually completed the
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.120]   study over the 28 days and the average age of the participants was 43 years old so that
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.240]   is what you have you have 28 women average age 43 and they went for a whole month you know roughly
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.920]   a month of of being on quantum upgrade so they did a big measurement before they were on quantum
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.720]   upgrade and then they were on quantum upgrade for 28 days and then they measured the difference
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.120]   and then materials that they used obviously was the quantum upgrade service but they also in
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.400]   terms of the technology they used to measure biomarker data and heart rate was a device called
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.240]   an aura ring. Most of our are you are familiar with the aura ring it's just like a little fit bit
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.280]   but it's a ring and and obviously you just wear it on your finger. The other materials that they
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.560]   did use was they used two different surveys to kind of get you know the women to then you know
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.200]   fill out the survey before and then again after they had been on quantum upgrade to then respond
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.320]   again to the same questions to kind of see what the differences were you know highly anecdotal but
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.120]   you know it's significantly you know significant at the end of the day when you start comparing
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.880]   the numbers and the data and all the information that comes from the study. Now one of the things
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.880]   about the results here again they were using the aura ring which to measure biomarker
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.480]   marker data also using the aura ring to measure the heart rate average heart rate and then they
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.280]   took two surveys women's health and quality of life so let me just jump right into the actual
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.720]   results here so this is the report itself and then if we just kind of scoot down past the key
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.960]   findings and the demographics and then we get into the actual biomarker data and the thing about the
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.400]   biomarker data was again you know they did measure using aura rings the first thing they looked at
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.560]   was sleep and then what's important here on this chart is that it basically shows the percent of
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.720]   participants who it improved so overall everybody improved but some just nominally and other
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.440]   significantly so it's up and down right 20 different people but here if you look at the far right
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.560]   column you'll see the percentages of people who actually you know who actually measured with the
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.840]   technology now a measured improvement so you're showing any you know what this basically says
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.800]   is anywhere from you know 55 to 65 percent of the population that was testing this showed and
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.280]   great you know they showed a great improvement in sleep and the quality of the sleep deep sleep
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.240]   REM sleep total sleep and so forth and so that was basically more than half actually had improved
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.040]   sleep and you'll see that again when they looked at the amount of time awake you know whether they're
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.960]   light sleepers or and they also looked at heart rate and highest and average or lowest and average
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.240]   and you can see right here that again it went from 55 to all the way up to 70 percent of the
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.800]   participants measured in improvement in their sleep quality from this perspective in terms of
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.040]   you know that aspect of sleep so greater than half experienced an improvement in their sleep
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.840]   by having the quantum upgrade turned on the other thing that was looked at was the biomarkers
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.680]   now they did some statistical analyses on this just to basically run the numbers on it
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.280]   just to kind of figure out okay you know statistically from all the numbers you know
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.480]   what was you know what was the overall outcome and that's where they determined
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.200]   that you know there was definitely a statistical improvement in heart rate resting heart rate
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.840]   in addition to the the quality of sleep that was being measured by the older rings okay so
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.880]   there's a really good thing the sleep was much better and so now the other thing too is that the
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.600]   survey data showed with the before and after surveys when they started taking a look at women's
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.800]   health just health in general because the other survey was quality of life but in the area of
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.640]   health they looked at and they basically asked the participants to rate themselves on you know on
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.200]   their level of you know anxiety and fear you know how well they slept the depressed mood
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:55.120]   attractiveness sematics menstruals you know cycles of vasomatore memory and sexual behavior
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.240]   and so you can see right here that there was a percentage of change from before they were on
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.600]   quantum upgrade and after they use quantum upgrade for 28 days where the significant you know from
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:12.000]   the statistically the significance of improvements centered around anxiety and fear the lowest numbers
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.200]   the you know the lower score indicates an improvement so the most significant you know so obviously
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:25.360]   the aura rings showed a demonstrated measurable improvement in sleep and sleep quality the aura
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.960]   rings also measured the demonstrate you know it's a measurable difference in resting heart rate so
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.240]   awesome results right there just from having quantum upgrade running but then when they
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.840]   actually took the surveys they discovered that the women the most significant result from the
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:48.640]   survey the first survey on health was that the the population of the participants in the study
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.000]   reported that they had lower levels of anxiety and fear now the other things measured there were
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.640]   improvements that but they weren't as significant as anxiety and fear but there were improvements
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:04.640]   across the board for all all the ladies participating in the study now they did the quality of life
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:10.960]   survey and these are the results here and they showed a huge increase improvement increase
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.640]   in the category of limitations due to emotional problems so anyone who is experiencing you know
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:24.000]   issues with their emotions they demonstrated on 34 improvement overall in their emotional you
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.040]   know I guess they don't self self you know evaluated well being there from an emotional
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.080]   standpoint and then you can see the differences of changes here and limitations to physical health
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:41.280]   pain physical functioning emotional well-being general health fatigue energy and also social
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:46.960]   functioning so here when we take a look at the statistical data the overall summary here is that
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:53.280]   the energy fatigue emotional well-being and general health data were normally distributed
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:59.840]   the t-tests were used to assess changes in these variables while the Wilcoxen signed rank tests
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.040]   which is what they were using or were used for the other five domains so what the overall result
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:13.120]   from the quality of life surveys was that the statistical significance was found in energy fatigue
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:18.240]   emotional well-being general health and roles limited it associated with emotional problems
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:25.040]   social function and pain so all of the women reported improvements but the most significant
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:30.240]   improvements were in these categories right there where you know quantum upgrade helped these ladies
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.760]   with their energy the fatigue they helped them with their emotional well-being their general health
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.480]   you know dealing with emotional problems social function and pain which is real interesting that
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.440]   they all reported that improvement in whatever they were suffering from so there you go I mean
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:51.280]   it's kind of a it's a short little study it's a pilot you know of just you know like 28 women but
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.720]   you know they studied these ladies before and after they they put them on their quantum
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.840]   upgrade for a whole month and overall there was an incredible improvement in a lot of different
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.720]   categories of their health and well-being and some of them were quite significant and that
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.920]   thing is at the end of the day is the output of the study was that you know what that quantum
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.680]   upgrade really kind of did something really wonderful for these ladies and and you know
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.720]   some issues you know more significant than others but at the end of the day quantum upgrade proved
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:30.480]   with this third-party company you know evaluating it for Leila that quantum upgrade is very beneficial
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:37.040]   and it can be very helpful in specific areas and it can be generally helpful in most areas and I
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.240]   think that's kind of one of the most remarkable findings from the study and it was kind of interesting
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.120]   how they use technology and surveys but that's what that's what we have that's the study right now
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.880]   on women's health and quantum upgrade so I want to just say thank you again for watching and this
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:59.040]   study is brand new just came out last week and so it hasn't been loaded to the study website you
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.560]   know where they keep all their studies so it'll be out there shortly I'm assuming but until then
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.160]   here's your science recap on the on the study I appreciate your time thanks for watching and have
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.580]   a great day. Aloha!
