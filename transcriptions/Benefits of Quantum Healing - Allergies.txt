[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   Aloha, everyone, and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.520]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and in this video, it's another installment in the series, Benefits
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.780]   of Quantum Healing as it relates to allergies.
[00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.760]   So in this video, I will be sharing with you the background behind quantum healing and
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.200]   the research we've discovered as it relates to treating individuals with allergy symptoms
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.560]   and allergy problems.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.440]   Also, we've got the preliminary results of the first study ever done by independent
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.720]   third-party institution on quantum healing with allergies, and also the testimonies
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.880]   that we've got from our telegram community in terms of using the different tools that
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.160]   have been provided by Leila Quantum Tech in helping their own allergies or the ones
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.160]   around them.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.060]   So let's get started.
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.920]   Right off the bat, the most interesting thing about allergies and the idea of quantum healing
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.820]   aka frequency medicine is that it's actually, depending on the type of allergy you have,
[00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.840]   it'll be a different modality that seems to work best with that, you know, that variation.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.320]   So there's a distinct difference between seasonal allergies and food allergies when it comes
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.320]   to quantum healing.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.320]   So right off the bat, so just what a level said on the difference here is that people
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.560]   who are suffering or are looking for something as a solution towards seasonal allergies,
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.280]   you know, congestion, sneezey, runny nose, itchy eyes, that sort of thing.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.400]   I call it, you know, the hay fever response, you know, there's going to be a different
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.280]   approach to, you know, working with that in terms of quantum healing as you would have
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.920]   if you would have a food allergy, which is something that would, you know, make your
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.200]   throat swell up, you know, hives, itching, wheezing, abdominal pain, you know, issues
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.040]   with having to sit on the toilet, you know, that sort of thing.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.600]   So there's a distinct difference, so in that difference lies, each one has its own way
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.120]   of, you know, finding relief through quantum healing.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.600]   So this is what we've discovered so far.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.440]   When it comes to seasonal allergies, we've discovered that molecular frequencies work
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.840]   really well with seasonal allergies.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.840]   So a few years ago, I was asked through the community to, you know, come up with a, you
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.400]   know, like what we used to call it, the allergy relief booster.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.680]   And so, essentially, I compiled a list of substances you can see here on the left ears,
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.840]   astrogolus, benedryl, clear guard, and so forth.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.000]   And I put together a frequency set called, you know, the allergy booster now called
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.960]   seasonal relief.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.440]   And for those of you who don't know what that is specifically, it's just real quickly,
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.360]   a physical substance, you know, every physical substance in the universe is broken down to
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.600]   the smallest particles and, you know, usually it's atomic or subatomic particles.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.680]   But the idea here is that all particles, all molecules, all atoms have all these little
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.560]   particles that are spinning around.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.600]   And all that motion, that vibration, creates a frequency.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.720]   So if you want, you can go on a YouTube and you type in molecular frequencies and you
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.560]   get pages and pages and pages of different professors and grad students explaining the
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.800]   physics and the calculations behind molecular frequencies.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.120]   So it's a real thing.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.640]   So these frequencies of these substances, right, are what can be copied using quantum tools.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.420]   You can copy a frequency of a substance onto, you know, onto another object, usually a
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.800]   metal card, whatever, to rename it, coins.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.880]   And then you can carry that frequency around with you that's embedded in that object.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.000]   And that frequency then reacts with your biofield and then produces, you know, the desired effect.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.560]   So what I've got here for you from the concept of seasonal allergies is we've created, or
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.760]   I created actually, the seasonal relief booster, it's made up of these, the molecular frequencies
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:00.320]   of this substance and in theoretical, these frequencies all combine to create some kind
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.320]   of a biofield harmonic that works with your own energy field and that's why it works.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.000]   So, you know, for this one, there's been no study because typically it was just a product
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.680]   development thing where I created something, it gets tested with a pilot group, it gets
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.680]   good results.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.200]   By the way, nothing goes onto the website unless it gets tested in a pilot and then once we
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.760]   get positive results from numerous people, then it goes on to the website for sale.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.080]   So it passed that, it went on the website for sale and people have been using it for
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.000]   over, you know, for a couple of years now.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.840]   So there have been some very positive testimonies I want to share with you to kind of give you
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.220]   an idea of what people are experiencing with using the frequency for seasonal allergies
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.040]   for that particular type of, you know, situation.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.720]   So the very first testimony I want to share with you is from Phillip von Holzendorf himself,
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.880]   the owner of Leila Q.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.080]   So the other day, I think it was like about a month ago, Phillip posted in the telegram
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.360]   chat group, I and Mitchell and I on Sarah Westall's latest business game changers, it's a podcast.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.640]   In case somebody wonders about my frequent eye blinking in this particular interview,
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.040]   I had a heavy pollen allergy come up right the night before, eyes, itch, nose, clogs,
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.760]   sneezing, not much good sleep.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.460]   But for the interview, you know, Phillip took the seasonal frequency card and set his quantum
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.280]   upgrade on a booster.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   And then while his eyes were still dry and his face looked like a little worn, the nose
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.360]   was fully free again, no sneezing, no itching, you know.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.480]   And so that's just one example of him using the frequency card for allergies when he
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.480]   had allergy symptoms.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   It went away.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.240]   Now, there's another testimony out there from Barbara and she goes on to say, again,
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.600]   I want to see how great the allergy card is.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.840]   My husband forgot it yesterday and we were all out all day and later evening.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.680]   He was miserable by the end.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.680]   We got home.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.720]   I reminded him of the allergy card.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.520]   He reports that he laid down with the card on his chest and within three minutes, everything
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.160]   cleared and he could breathe and sleep.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.960]   He says normally he cannot lay down as he cannot breathe.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   Thanks, Kay.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.600]   Now, a couple of more testimonials on the seasonal allergy frequency from Nora.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.280]   She writes, "The allergy relief booster has worked for me.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.000]   If I catch things quick enough and put on the bracelet to which I copied the frequency,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.840]   lives usually don't bloom and I still use an histamines, but have to use much less."
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.440]   Another individual called Branch reported, "Mowing season has started and typically
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.520]   every time I mow, I go to bed with my eyes watering nose, itching and the whole face,
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.920]   you know, feeling miserable."
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.160]   None of that is happening so far.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.880]   Wearing the heel capsule with the and the allergy card, it feels like the histamine starts
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.360]   to creep up on me and I did sneeze a few times on the mower, but then it backs off and I'm
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   fine.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.160]   It doesn't take hold at all.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.760]   Very excited and I'm hoping it sticks as the season progresses so that's pretty cool.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.280]   Now, from Jamie, this is what I want to really kind of stress.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.280]   Jamie's got this great testimony and by the way, these are all on telegram in our public
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   chat group.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.600]   Well, it's a private chat group but, you know, it's open to the public once you join it and
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.640]   so you can read these testimonies that people are writing.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.200]   These are just from your, you know, everybody else has just unsolicited community member
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200]   feedback.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.160]   You know, this is straight from the horse actually.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.400]   So, Jamie reports, "I just made my own frequency card and it's working fabulously.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.920]   It is so windy and dusty here I live right now and where I live right now and my allergies
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.440]   were so bad I couldn't go outside longer for then five minutes at a time.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.920]   I didn't want to wait to order a card and I have a QB which is a quantum block.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.800]   So I used a combo of herbs that helped me and I've been carrying the card with me and no
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   allergies.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:49.560]   It's amazing and so exciting to have access to this incredible technology."
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:55.020]   So with that, I want to remind everybody that if you have a block, you know, you can make
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.560]   your own frequencies, you can, you know, cards, you can make your own boosters, you know,
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.920]   you can do your own thing just like I did or, you know, obviously go to the website and
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.920]   buy one.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.840]   But the idea though is that if it's something that, you know, molecular frequencies works
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.900]   well with, that's something that all of us mere mortals, you know, have access to.
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.980]   And so it's something that's really exciting because it says not only, you know, do these
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.960]   substances work that I used but also that, you know, Jamie came up with her own and it
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.880]   worked which is kind of cool because it not only validates the concept that A it works,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.380]   it also emphasizes the fact that you guys have a really powerful tool if you own a block
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.800]   and don't hesitate to use them, all right.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.800]   Okay.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.640]   So now the next thing we talk about in terms of allergies, so, you know, that takes care
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.020]   of seasonal, let's talk about food allergies.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.340]   And the first thing about food allergies is I want to share with you a disclaimer from
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.900]   Philip, the founder of Layla Q just to make sure everybody's really on the same page with
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.900]   this one.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:02.300]   So the disclaimer for food allergies, you know, using quantum healing for food allergies,
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:08.740]   the disclaimer is as follows, please do not try this at home because we do not yet have
[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:14.000]   enough data to provide proper guidance for this application and we can't make any claims
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.480]   either yet.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.740]   Usage for the sake of easing allergic responses is therefore solely at everyone's own risk.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.400]   Our products have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat,
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.840]   or prevent any disease or health condition, all right.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:36.300]   With that out of the way, how this all started was again, you know, it's just things that
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:42.460]   people do that then they share because it's a very collaborative, heartwarming, really
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.620]   close-knit group of people were over 6,000 now on Telegram.
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.940]   And so somehow it came about where, you know, it started where people were saying, hey,
[00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.260]   I put something in the block and then, you know, it helped the allergic response that
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.860]   I would normally have, you know, from this food that I'm eating.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:05.540]   So how it all really kicked off was there was a biohacker conference last year that
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:12.100]   Philip and Ian Mitchell, who's the science advisor for Leila Q.
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.780]   And they were up on stage.
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.820]   Dave Asprey was there, you know, just biohackers, right, really famous biohackers.
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.540]   And they did this experiment live in front of this audience.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.900]   The video and video link will be in the description below.
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:33.300]   And they did this test and basically at the end of the day they had this guy, Todd, the
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.540]   biohacker, super allergic to shellfish.
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:42.380]   They took one sample and without any treatment, or any quantum treatment at all, and he broke
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.780]   out in hives.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:50.460]   And then they treated the second sample from the same can of some kind of shellfish.
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.180]   And they put it in a block for, I believe, six to seven minutes.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:59.820]   And then they tried it again on Todd, absolutely no reaction.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:05.140]   And so it's in the video, you can see it yourself, and then you'll find out that it's
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:10.580]   just, and they show his arms before and after, or actually there was two separate arms, one
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.220]   treated, one not treated with quantum, and the one that was not treated as normal, and
[00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:20.460]   the one that was not treated that was just off, you know, had nothing but hives on it.
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:26.060]   So really interesting experiment that they did live at the biohacker conference, which
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:31.540]   led to a lot of us going, you know, hey, I want to try that, you know, albeit we ignore
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.540]   the disclaimer.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:36.420]   But the whole idea though, is it really kind of made people who have problems with stuff
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.620]   start thinking, hey, you know, if that would work for me.
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.620]   So again, the disclaimer is, you know, and I want to emphasize this, but you know, this
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.780]   is all really new.
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:50.260]   This is, you know, quantum healing as it relates to food allergies.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:53.540]   Very, very new in terms of discovery.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.380]   There's an actual study I'm going to share with you that preliminary results, I'll share
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:00.940]   with you in a second, but this is amazing.
[00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.900]   This is truly amazing that it can do this, you know, and so, you know, in light of like
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:10.540]   the frequency medicine and in relation to seasonal allergies, you know, I shouldn't
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:16.460]   be too surprised, but, you know, if you expand on what this means to other things, and you
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.140]   know, you start to grasp how important this is.
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:26.060]   So the first thing I want to share was because of the results of this experiment that they
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:31.620]   did at the biohacking conference, then what Philip did was he commissioned a naturopathic
[00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.980]   clinic in Germany to then actually do actual studies.
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:41.820]   And this is a clinic that has really, really expensive machines, and you know, they have
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.940]   the ability to do these third party independent NIH level studies, you know, double blind
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.040]   blah, blah.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.680]   And so they're able to do these studies.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.360]   So now the study is actually underway as of December 22, all right.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.200]   So this is today is January 22, 2023.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.880]   So the studies are actually ongoing right now, but they've been able to get some preliminary
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.880]   results.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.240]   Let me share them with you from a post that Philip posted on Telegram.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.240]   This is from Philip.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.460]   I had a call today with a doctor of the naturopathic clinic in Germany that's been running the
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.500]   food allergy pilot study.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:20.880]   They're using a oaf greater than a $40,000 medical device to accurately test allergic
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:27.120]   responses and reliefs, which can be measured on a very granular level.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:31.760]   They tested gluten, milk lactose, and several other substances and sugar.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.960]   And then while sugar doesn't create allergic responses, we all know that it's not healthy,
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.000]   you know, and actually adds a lot of stress to the human body in many ways, if you didn't
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.480]   know sugar is actually a poison.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.460]   But still most of us love sugar and I do.
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:54.740]   So they, the clinic were able to test a reduction in negative impact to the body by sugar in
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.380]   between 75 to 85%, which is phenomenal.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.540]   So what that kind of translates to is this machine or the devices that they're using
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:08.380]   and the clinicians are testing subjects are able to measure the stress responses, you
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:13.660]   know, physiological stress responses in the body to stimulate, that's what it means.
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:18.220]   So I'm going to, until we get the study, we're not going to know the exact methods and,
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.880]   you know, you know, materials and methods, right, section of the study.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.920]   We won't know like, you know, exactly what they're measuring, but I'm guessing that they're
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.100]   measuring histamine levels, inflammation levels and things like that, to actually, that causes
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.540]   stress to the body.
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:37.180]   And they're able to see this reduction in those stress responses, right?
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:41.740]   So the other thing that they go on, that they discovered thus far, and this is very preliminary,
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:48.140]   is that regarding allergic response to other substances, right, food, things that you would
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:56.980]   ingest, they've discovered a 65 to 95% reduction in allergic responses when measured, when
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:02.380]   it was measured, when the substance was charged for three minutes in the travel block, okay,
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.820]   which is the equivalent to an infinity block.
[00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.180]   So then Philip goes on to say further good news.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:13.340]   The clinic tested with three minutes charging, we believe that the time should be four minutes.
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:18.660]   So for the next phase of more extended study and test series will move to the four minutes.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.020]   We should get some preliminary graphs sent to us soon.
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.740]   This is very exciting and I can't emphasize that enough.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:29.780]   This is going to be the first independent third party, you know, double line, you know,
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:35.220]   there's study done using quantum healing for food allergies and just the preliminary results
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.700]   are just amazing.
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:40.580]   It's demonstrating through an actual study that this is happening.
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:45.940]   So the testimonies are being validated with a study and I think that is very important
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:51.740]   for this video because it's not always about testimonies and happy customers, but it's
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:55.300]   also that we're doing third party studies because, you know, there's always the placebo
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.460]   effect, right?
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:00.860]   If you take out the placebo effect, typically you just want to throw 30% of your results
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.860]   away.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.180]   You're still going to have some incredible, incredible results.
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.900]   So that's the study that they've got going on and this is what we know so far.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.820]   Now the next thing I want to share with you is my personal food allergy study.
[00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:19.340]   Once I heard about the biohacker, you know, test, then I went ahead and did my own study.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.940]   So I just wanted to share with you.
[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.620]   I'm personally allergic to MSG, MSG stands for monsoidium glutamate.
[00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:31.340]   It is a neural toxin that people or that, you know, food producers will put into food
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:36.060]   and what it does amongst a whole list of horrible things to your brain.
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.900]   When I say neural toxin, it affects your brain.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:46.660]   It's a toxin that's, you know, for your, that affects your neural activity in your brain.
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.700]   And so why people use it in food is it convinces your brain.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:55.620]   Your ingesting is really, really, really good and it causes you to want to eat it again
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.620]   and again.
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:58.220]   It's like chemical brainwashing.
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.460]   I'm not kidding.
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.460]   Look it up.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.460]   All right.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:05.180]   So I happen to be really, really sensitive to it and I'm really allergic to it because
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.740]   I grew up with my mother dumping it on everything I ate and I think I just something happened
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.740]   to me.
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.140]   And so now in my adult years, I'm allergic to it.
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:19.740]   If I eat any MSG at all, okay, then I will break out in a rash, hives, itching.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:20.740]   I mean, it's horrible.
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.020]   It's like the worst case of eczema you could have.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:28.140]   And then it also then right after that, it hits my brain and I go into straight negativity
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.020]   anger mode and you know, it's neural toxin, right?
[00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.540]   It's going to affect your brain.
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.700]   And so it's really, really bad for me and I have to avoid it or I used to have to avoid
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.700]   it.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.780]   Like explain why I don't know.
[00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:45.260]   So what I did was to do my experiment was I went off 660 for three months.
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:51.100]   For those of you who know my background, I'm very much into this carbon 60 supplement
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.220]   and blah, blah, blah, I won't get into it.
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.980]   But one of the things that it does is it neutralizes toxins, right?
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.660]   And so if you're taking it, nothing, no toxins are going to affect you.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.060]   So I had to stop taking it.
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.860]   So I stopped taking it for three months.
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.380]   And so at that point, I became kind of like the normal me.
[00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.180]   And so then I proceeded to then subject myself to MSG.
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:17.940]   So I ate up, you know, like basically some Japanese food and all Japanese food.
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.260]   As you all know, just like Chinese food, you know, Asian foods are just heavy.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.700]   I mean, these are heavy users of month sodium glutamate.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:31.140]   And so then I ate a plate and that's the plate right there in the picture.
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.860]   And so I had some food kake and some taco on some seasoned nuti.
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.900]   And then I ate that and then I had an experience literally that night.
[00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.780]   My arms were, I had hives on my arms.
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:44.140]   I was itching and then, you know, like it lasted for three days.
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:48.700]   And I just got it, you know, got all grumpy and I just typical response and I hate that,
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.940]   by the way.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.580]   And so, but, you know, this is for science.
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:59.180]   So now the quantum healing thing that I did was I just repeated the experiment that they
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.420]   did on Todd the biohacker.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:06.620]   So I waited a week for the symptoms to subside to prove that, you know, yeah, I'm, you know,
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.980]   if I eat this stuff, yeah, it affects me, I mean, you know, point blank.
[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.140]   So then I waited a week.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.140]   All the symptoms went away and then I ate the exact same meal again.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:21.140]   But the second time I put that meal in that block, my eye block right there and I put it
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.540]   in there for six minutes before I ate it.
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.060]   Then I ate it.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.460]   And then of course, the answer was there was no reaction.
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.420]   The second time, nothing happened at all, nothing.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.620]   And so then, so then it kind of proved to me that, you know, it kind of emphasizes and
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.500]   this is before the study, the preliminary results of the study came out.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:43.340]   But it told me that, hey, you know, there's something happening here and it works, you
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.500]   know, in this example for me, my personal opinion, my personal experience.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.620]   I'm back on C-69, I have to worry about it.
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.380]   So I don't really charge my food all the time, you know, other than just wanting to get that
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:58.580]   quantum energy into it, but I don't worry about allergens when I'm on C-60.
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.340]   But the idea here though is that, hey, you know what, charging it worked for me.
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.340]   That's my testimony.
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.260]   So we have some other testimonies I want to share with you.
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.260]   One about food allergies.
[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.420]   And so I think it just kind of reemphasizes that, you know, it's working for other people
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:17.060]   as well, who are also ignoring the disclaimer, you guys.
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.980]   And so, you know, taking one for the science team, right?
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.980]   But again, you know, if you are allergic to something, I just can't, if emphasize this
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.460]   enough, Philip emphasizes every time he talks about it.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.460]   But you know, if you got something that's super serious and you have to have an EpiPen
[00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.420]   hand, you know, handy or you go, you know, because you don't want to go into anaphylactic
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.700]   shock, you know, don't, don't do this.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.700]   You know, just don't, you know, I only did it because the worst thing that could happen
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.820]   to me was rashes and getting pissed off about everything.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.340]   You know, other than, you know, other than going into an epileptic shock and going to
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.340]   hospital.
[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.340]   So, you know, be careful.
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:53.900]   Don't, don't sacrifice yourself, but you know, but these other folks are just trying
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:54.900]   it.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.660]   So this is what other people have been doing since this news came out.
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:04.180]   So Mark reported that he says he has, "I have weekly appointments with a biofield psychrotronic
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:12.020]   device called metatron," sorry, "where I bring certain foods, items for allergy testing.
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:18.740]   Last week, the IB Level 1 was able to transform food, black pepper, that I couldn't tolerate
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:23.180]   with negative percentage values to positive percentage values.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.980]   I could eat them without negative consequences.
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.580]   They're charging for six minutes.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.580]   This is amazing.
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:35.700]   However, the same transformed food items sampled returned to negative percentage values shown
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:39.660]   in the metatron after they were placed in the fridge for a week.
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:44.540]   But when placed in the IB for six minutes again, they again showed positive percentage
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.100]   values.
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:51.020]   That's amazing because no one else here has figured out how long does that affect last.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:58.660]   So what Mark's post is kind of alluding to is that it works, but it wears off.
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:04.140]   So heads up to anybody who wants to try this is eat the food right away or eat the food,
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.820]   you know, it's basically bottom line.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:09.540]   If you're going to do this, charge it before you eat it.
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:13.140]   Don't charge it and then wait a week as Mark has discovered.
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:18.580]   Now, Edward reports, though his quote field report, "One of my friends is strongly allergic
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:24.240]   to lemons. At the smallest amount in the food, he immediately reacts strongly negative."
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:29.180]   So we put a lemon in the IB, which is infinity block, and he ate half of it.
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:34.420]   The result absolutely no negative reaction first time in his life.
[00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:41.460]   The second half of the lemon we then we have then brought to an experienced medical practitioner
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:48.500]   also with another untreated half of a lemon tested both on my friend using kinesiology
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:54.020]   according to Dr. Klinghardt, a whole other subject, great science without saying which
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:55.700]   half was treated.
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:01.340]   So they tested him with using kinesiology with the doctor, the two lemons.
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.540]   So here's the guy holding the two lemons and you know what I'm talking about.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:11.660]   The result is the IB charged lemon test positive and the untreated test negative.
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.740]   So there were no more questions, not recommending to do so.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:20.660]   Hey, someone that read the disclaimer, but it worked for him amazingly well.
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:28.380]   So Edward, he's basically adhering to the disclaimer, but he's leaving his friend to
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.380]   try it.
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:36.300]   Alright, so now here's another testimony from Gary, quick story about an allergy test that
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.980]   we did at home with the infinity block.
[00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.320]   My wife always had a physical reaction with eating pineapple.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.620]   It's not a very strong allergic reaction, but it is uncomfortable enough that she stays
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.020]   clear of pineapple for the most part.
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:53.700]   When she eats pineapple, she has a burning or stinging sensation in her throat.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:59.500]   I decided to test this following the sample that was used at the Biola Bulletproof Conference
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.340]   on stage with Todd Dabohacker.
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:06.700]   I put pineapple into the infinity block for six minutes and took it out and gave some
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:13.180]   to my wife and she said she had no burning or stinging sensation, whatever whatsoever.
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:17.980]   So since doing this for the first time about a month ago, she has now eaten pineapple five
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.140]   times and is enjoying it.
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:27.020]   So this is awesome, and here's another classic example of using someone you know at your
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.020]   guinea pig instead of you.
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.020]   So I'm sorry, I'm just joking, I think it's really funny.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:37.300]   Okay, so now Nora reports her testimony for food allergies and quantum healing was that
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:42.820]   I've successfully used the cue block to eliminate reactions to food to which I have a sensitivity
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:48.100]   to, gastric issues, as well as foods to which I have a mild allergy body reactions.
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:50.280]   It takes three to four minutes in the cue block.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.820]   I have yet to try these foods in the eye block.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:59.860]   There are two foods to which I am highly allergic to and I'm too much of a chicken
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.020]   to attempt these either.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:05.820]   And Nora, thank you for sharing your end Gary and everyone else that I've mentioned in this
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:06.820]   video.
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.300]   Thank you for sharing your testimonies and I totally agree with you.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:14.060]   If you've got highly allergic, you may not want to tinker with that, but I just wanted
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:22.780]   to demonstrate that these testimonies and the preliminary studies are a remarkable result
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.800]   of the use of quantum healing for allergies.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.980]   So this is what this video is all about.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.740]   Wanted to share that with you and I want to say thank you, you know, for watching the
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:36.980]   video and I'm going to just leave this video right after I sign off here is going to be
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:45.300]   a clip from Ian Mitchell, who actually owns and runs wizard sciences, but he's a very
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:52.180]   accomplished scientist on his own, numerous patents under his own name, former professor.
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:55.900]   Now he's an entrepreneur and he's just a brilliant mind.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:00.140]   And he's also the, you know, get the science advisor to Leila Quantum Tech.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:05.420]   So there's a clip here from one of the, he was recently on just like five months ago,
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:11.620]   Ian Mitchell was on a podcast called fixed to people in which he describes his story,
[00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.020]   the story of Todd the biohacker.
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:19.860]   And then he goes on to sort of explain from a scientific or quantum biology perspective
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:25.860]   on why this is happening and how it, how he sees it, you know, how it sees, he's working.
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.540]   So I just want to share that clip with you.
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:32.100]   It's going to follow this sign off so that you can kind of see from the science perspective,
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.880]   you know, kind of why is this working and how is this happening.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:39.540]   So I thought you might enjoy that clip from the fixed to people podcast with Ian Mitchell.
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.940]   So again, though, but I want to sign off.
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.580]   I'll leave you with that clip to follow this one and say thank you.
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:46.460]   I always appreciate your time.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:51.820]   Your time watching these videos is very valuable and, you know, and I just want to say I appreciate
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:52.820]   that.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.820]   Thank you for watching these.
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.300]   I hope you've learned something, you know, and I also want to encourage everyone, you
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:02.460]   know, if you have the quantum tools and you can, and you know, someone who's got allergies,
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:07.200]   you know, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding, but just the whole idea is that you could
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.200]   do this.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.200]   It works.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.320]   Here are the results and the, the, the formal study will come and I'll share that with you
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.680]   when it comes here, but it's just, it's so cool because so many people have allergies
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.680]   in today's world and here's something that could really help them with the, which is
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.120]   the amazing, you know, features of quantum healing.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.220]   So thank you very much.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:31.680]   If you want to learn more about quantum energy, if, you know, please visit quants, Layla quantum
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.400]   tech and, or the tinker's catting them on my blog where I've got a huge section on quantum
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.400]   energy.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.760]   The links below in the video description and thank you very much and I'll leave you here
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:47.360]   with Ian Mitchell on, on fix the people podcast talking about the science behind how quantum
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.520]   healing works for allergies.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.520]   All right.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.520]   Thank you very much.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.520]   A lot.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.960]   One of the books that I had is required reading for my class when I taught at university
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:02.900]   was a life on the edge by Jamal Khalil and John Jim McFadden, and it's, it's a real book
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:07.060]   and it's all, you know, it's all, it's really good all about quantum biology.
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:11.660]   And it gives examples of ways that things that we aren't quite capable of perceiving
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.180]   yet are cascading up and becoming biological effects.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:20.180]   So at the conference last year, I took a fellow Todd Shetman, he's a good friend of mine
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:25.620]   and biohiker Todd and he's a, you know, endurance runner, ultra marathoner, but he has a horrible
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:30.580]   shellfish allergy, like we'll land him in the hospital kind of shellfish allergy.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:34.980]   And so I brought him on stage and I had a can of crab meat and I opened up the crab
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.220]   meat and I derma rolled his forearm and put the crab meat in it.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.660]   And you know, instant histamine reaction, dig welts on the arm, puffed up.
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:42.660]   It's all red.
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.020]   You can find this on YouTube.
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:48.020]   And then I put it, I put the crab meat in a thing called the quantum block and which
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:52.660]   modulates things at a level that's kind of two layers below subatomic.
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.980]   So it's modulating things that sort of a waveform level.
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:59.140]   And I lectured about waves, you know, and I said, you know, everybody picture a wave
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.580]   and I gave the audience a second and I said, you know, most of you are picturing something
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.420]   like this, because that's what we're taught, but that's not even remotely how it works,
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.420]   right?
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.140]   It's spheres and they're moving and undulating and they have chirality.
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.300]   So there's a spin to them and they have a pressure and a color and, you know, there's
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:18.820]   probably like 17, 18 different dimensions that I can, you know, say like this is an actual
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.820]   tangible aspect of this thing to describe it.
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:25.280]   And when you start to look at that, you can get effects that are different.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.180]   So then I took the can of crab meat out and I derma rolled his other arm and put it on
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.340]   and there was no reaction.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.780]   And it seemed almost like a magic trick, right?
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:38.420]   Because, you know, you obviously don't lose a histamine reaction in three minutes.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:42.020]   But what's really going on is you're not actually having the physical expression to
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:48.220]   histamine reaction isn't because of histamines, it's because you're having a destructive interference
[00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.160]   pattern happen at a waveform level with your physiology, right?
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.140]   Because if you, you know, from quantum physics, if you break things down below sub-atomics,
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.780]   at its essence, what you have is all these vibrating patterns that form an integrity
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:05.760]   that coalesces to form molecules that then form, you know, your biological components.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.060]   So if you affect it at the very forefront of when it's starting to become manifest in
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.820]   reality, then you can modulate that and get a shift.
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.980]   And so that's pretty much what I did is I just modulated that.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:21.460]   So instead of having a destructive interference pattern, Todd had a constructive interference
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:22.460]   pattern.
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.460]   So he didn't have a reaction.
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.580]   It just suddenly, it was modulated.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.460]   So that thing worked with his biology.
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:33.380]   It's kind of like smoothing out the edges of the molecules because it's not as, it's
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.500]   not as detrimental when it impacts your physiology, right?
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.620]   It goes through and instead of scraping you, it's smooth.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:40.700]   And that's all it really is.
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:46.100]   So, you know, things like that, it's hard to assess, but that's where we are in science
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:50.860]   right now is like we're at the level when I run a special analysis on those compounds,
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:57.100]   there is no change if I run gas chromatograph or high pressure chromatography, right?
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.500]   So like I run something through that and it says it is a this thing.
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.060]   And that's as far as we get usually, right?
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:08.180]   Science basically is we're stopping at this is a box and the box is this.
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.200]   We haven't really started to look at what's inside the box, right?
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.780]   That's like the quantum part where we start to take into account how are the electrons
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:19.740]   spinning, what's their orbital pattern, what happens when we get those things coherence?
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:23.460]   Is there a difference if they're in phase and in coherence and there as it turns out
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.660]   there are, you know, there are big differences, right?
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:31.100]   Like I'll run an analysis on something in the lab that says it's the exact same compound,
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:35.820]   no different from the same source, I'll quantumly modify one and then run it through reduction
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.420]   oxidation potentials and get numbers that are entirely different.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:44.520]   It still reads out as the same compound with the way it interacts with reality to totally
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:48.540]   different, you know, and that's kind of boom, that's where we are, you know, right at the
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.040]   edge.
