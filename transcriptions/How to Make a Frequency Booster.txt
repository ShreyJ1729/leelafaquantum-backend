[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.380]   Kay Elmer and in this video I'd like to share with you how to make a frequency
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.840]   booster using any one of the three Leila Quantum Tech blocks. Now for those of
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.880]   you who own them you've made a considerable investment and this is one
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.920]   way to leverage that investment for your greater wellness of you, your home, your
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.240]   pets and so forth. So let's jump right into this tutorial and before we start

[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.240]   for them. This is all everything that I do in all of these videos. I come from a
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.660]   place of just being an avid Tinker and one of the early adopters and someone
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.620]   who just really really really is fascinated by this technology and I just
[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.780]   want to share what I learned. So let's jump right in. Now one of the things about
[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.580]   making a booster and it is so utterly simple but there's a lot of tiny little
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.300]   details and that's why there's a tutorial here but one of the things that
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.820]   you need to understand is that you know the main thing is there's a difference
[00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.220]   between copying a frequency and charging an object. Okay that's the first thing
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.420]   I want to put out there so if you're going to be using a quantum block it's
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.340]   it's 60 seconds to copy a frequency but three minutes to charge the object you
[00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.220]   copied it to. If you're using an infinity or a travel block it's 20 seconds to
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.580]   copy the frequency and then it's 60 seconds to charge the object up which is
[00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.660]   usually going to be a card you know or capsule but you know the whole idea
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.980]   behind making boosters is that you know the way I do it is I first make a set of
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.500]   frequencies copy it onto a metal card right and you want to use the thick ones
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.400]   and then the card actually becomes like the master and it holds that frequency
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.940]   and then whenever I ever want to move that frequency or copy it onto something
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.980]   else I use pieces of foil all right so and that's a whole other discussion but
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.180]   the whole idea though is you're going to take the frequency of something right
[00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.980]   and put which I call the source frequency source and you're going to want to put
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.240]   it on to an object the frequency target. So in the issue here about using metal
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.680]   cards I want to just point out that if you go to my blog right here and you
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.000]   click on quantum energy right here at the very bottom is a list of tinker supplies
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.360]   you know I'm the tinker's Academy okay I tinker and so you can go ahead and find
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.040]   all the different stuff that you'd want if you wanted to make capsules and you
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.000]   know whatever but for cards right here if you click on these 1.27 millimeter
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.580]   cards you're going to get this website called the Chewbacca okay and these are
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.160]   the cards this is where I get them and I know there's other places you can get
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.880]   them and there's other types of metals you could use but basically I just kind
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.720]   of stick to the formula that works which is Leila quantum tech uses aluminum
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.000]   cards and so you know it works right and so but you know you want to get the
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.480]   thick ones so right here you would want to click on the thick ones the basically
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.280]   it's in half an inch you know which is like 1.27 millimeters and then you
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.800]   can go ahead and pick out any one of the different colors you want and you
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.120]   can go ahead and order blank cards so that's kind of where the starting point
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.220]   is so that's you know that's kind of where I go and that's where I get my
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.120]   cards now the thing about making boosters and I just came up with the term
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.280]   booster because my original my original original frequency booster was the men's
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.960]   booster middle-aged guy and I was looking to make a set of frequencies that were
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.360]   aimed at helping me personally as a middle-aged man and so basically so the
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.840]   focus that I had was actually if you look at the men's booster and I'll talk
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.200]   about that later there's five different components but the whole idea though is
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.520]   you know you want it you know you want to basically focus on one objective and
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.680]   what was that objective for me with the men's booster was you know middle-aged
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.320]   men how do I how do you support middle-aged men and then I made the woman's
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.240]   one and so forth so you want to definitely not go you know and and you
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.360]   want to basically what I'm trying to say is you want to get like for like
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.200]   type of frequencies all in one place that they're all aimed at one objective
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.400]   and and that's where you're gonna get your biggest and this my experience by
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.280]   the way we're gonna get your biggest effect okay so you know you don't want
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.960]   to just mix a whole bunch of you know mix and match and then come out with
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.520]   something that has no purpose right it just has general purpose well you know
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.520]   and you know and that just doesn't really serve the whole point of making a
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.000]   booster so and then by the way this is all my own opinion and this is how I do
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.960]   stuff so it's really just focusing on one objective and then most important
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.640]   I can't stress this enough is you know when you're making the copies these are
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.080]   the tips when you're making the copy of the frequency you need to set or you
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.760]   should and I recommend it you set your intention you know and and in my in my
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.160]   mind it's like while I'm putting it in there and while it's charging I'm
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.200]   mentally focused on on you know you know help you know like basically like you
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.240]   know whatever whatever the objective is is how you know you know have you know
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.280]   have this help with inflammation have this help with you know your cognitive
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.400]   thinking and you know and and just kind of like put your intention of what you
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.360]   want out of that object and put that in now you can say you can say it out loud
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.320]   you can think it but the whole point is that you've got to be focused on on
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.440]   thinking that and putting that into the block because that really is what really
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.120]   drives a lot of a lot of this quantum energy frequency healing quantum
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.920]   healing whatever you want to call it but that's what really drives it is your
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:07.080]   intention and even more so never never do this when you're in a bad mood you
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.500]   know because it carries forward right so you want to just be sent to yourself
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.880]   while you're doing it and then put your intention and you let this heal you know
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.320]   whatever your intention might be for whatever you're making let this relieve
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.560]   you know seasonal allergies or whatever all of the different boosters I've made
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.000]   is I just say these simple little things but it makes a difference and I
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   don't know how it makes a difference but I know it makes a difference and that's
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.480]   one of those weird things about quantum energy so those are the three tips you
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.480]   know the first thing out of the gate is using a metal card to put it on you
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.960]   know put the frequency on that you copied focus on one objective and then
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.400]   make make sure you're you're setting an intention okay so here are the steps
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.640]   really to actually do it and it's so simple but you know it's but you know
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.560]   the details right but the first thing is about you know you know how do I come
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.040]   up with that you know how did I come up with the sets of substances that I put
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.120]   together in the different boosters that I've created and you know some of them
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.160]   work and some of them don't work you know and and so it's not it's not a
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.040]   guaranteed thing that's gonna it's gonna do what it you said it to do because
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.760]   sometimes it just doesn't work but sometimes they do and when they do they're
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.560]   awesome so when I research and this is how I do it you know I just basically
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.360]   go through the internet and and the first thing I do is like let me give you
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.840]   an example when I put together the men's booster one of the components of the
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.920]   men's booster is a brain booster there's one in there to just about your brain
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.040]   you know cuz middle-aged men right what are the things that we worry about well
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.040]   you know aging that they you know you know pushing off the the ravages of
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.680]   aging making sure our brains are working really well you know the testosterone
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.800]   you know keeping erect energy up you know and you know immune system at the
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.200]   time was a big deal right and then of course you know dealing with stress and
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.240]   so those are the five components so when I went if you just talk about the
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.120]   brain well I just did hours and hours of research just going on the internet
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.800]   saying hey what are the what are the absolute best supplements for improving
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.760]   your brain you know helping your brain cognitive reasoning memory retention
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.880]   every aspect of your brain functioning was what I went looking for and it wasn't
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.680]   just supplements was like ways to do it and things like that and so and I came
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.520]   up with this list of supplements that that basically cry had multiple lists
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.840]   from different sources and I narrowed them down to a set and that's what I
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.360]   started with and that and that's what I came up with for the brain booster which
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.160]   is inside of the men's booster okay so I use science right what did the science
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.880]   show you know things like DHEA you know you know and those kinds of things are
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.160]   really good for your brain so you know and lion's mane right things like that
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.720]   and so that's the science of it and then the same thing to you now what I've done
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:48.040]   and this is like two years ago and since then you know I just as I do more and
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:53.240]   more of these things and I and I use the quantum energy devices more it's become
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.040]   really intuitive to me and so one of the things also is is I do this I do the
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.080]   research now but then I am intuitively selecting and picking and choosing what
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.720]   I want to put into the booster and the most amazing thing to me is as I've been
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.840]   making different boosters some as some that worked some that didn't work and
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.040]   I'll explain how I know then the last one I did the most recent one that I did
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.360]   was calm for dogs I've got a little dog freaks out whenever they hear loud
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.720]   noises thunderstorms fireworks so forth and and so I just wanted to help her
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:33.920]   and so that one I did just using intuition and it was just I did a little
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.080]   research and like what could help a dog you know like things you know there's
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.160]   products out there like adapt till and things like that and essential those
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.680]   lavender so forth right there good for calming but then also at the same time
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.160]   though I was just really using my intuition I was able to obtain some
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.800]   prescription medication to help dogs relax and then I had to pick from the
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.040]   different ones that I had accumulated so and then when I finally figure out
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.720]   kind of like intuitively I was actually using some dowsing techniques so for
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.640]   those of you who are not familiar with dowsing and muscle testing it's just two
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.880]   ways to to basically kind of separate yourself okay because we are different
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.400]   things and one of the things and one of our to me I think one of the most biggest
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:20.000]   detractors of being human is we have this thing that you know it's it's been
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.320]   called the dinosaur brain if you read that book or monkey mind but we have a
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.440]   we have this thing in our head that kind of just wants to structure everything
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.440]   and it always wants to put everything into a box and have you know and it just
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.880]   wants to control everything and you need to kind of set that aside and just
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:41.720]   go into your into your I higher self I guess is the best way to say it and then
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.800]   basically just you know tune into yourself and one of the ways you can
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.880]   tune into yourself and get past that barrier you know this monkey mind
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.880]   dinosaur brain barrier that tries to mess with your life you get past that and
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.080]   you go directly into your intuition and women you know this way better than
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.160]   men right because you're born with really strong intuition men have to
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.320]   work at it and then so but dowsing and muscle testing is one way you can get
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:11.200]   past that and really get in tune with with your higher self and with your own
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.800]   intuition and so now I recommend if just go on YouTube if you're not familiar
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.640]   with dowsing I use a crystal pendulum and then you know I you can also use
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:24.120]   muscle testing but I kind of lean towards dowsing it just easier and so I
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.880]   started dowsing like which different supplements should will work best in
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:33.560]   this new calm for dog boosters and I completely made that one by dowsing and
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.560]   just using intuition a little bit science like I said but mostly from
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:43.040]   dowsing and then when I sent it in to have it evaluated it was spot on it
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.080]   worked right out of the gate and I'll tell you it not a lot of my boosters
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.920]   ever work right out of the gate they have to be tweaked and so I was just
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.000]   really amazed that it actually worked so well that way so I just really want
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.120]   to encourage everyone again that you are the most powerful being in your universe
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:05.000]   and when you tap into your true self it amazing things happen and so just keep
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.480]   in mind that you know we got to get past that dinosaur brain anyway so that's
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.760]   how I kind of figure out and that's the biggest part of this is right it's like
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.520]   what am I going to put into my booster because sure you could just use one let's
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.760]   say like for me whenever I have I even feel a little bit icky right I just put
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:25.440]   my picture in my cube lock or my inner eye block with a bottle of oregano oil
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.400]   because oregano oil is this magical oil is central oil that will basically take
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.000]   care of any virus bug bacteria anything in you if you put it on physically but
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.960]   its frequency is very powerful I mean it's even you know heavily mentioned in
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   the Bible it goes back eons right so oregano oil is very very sacred and so I
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.360]   use that and boy I'll tell you I just I just flip right over if I feel a little
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.520]   icky like I'm catching something boom picture oregano oil in the block and it
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.600]   works so you can just have a booster you know I mean it's boosters usually a
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.720]   combination of frequencies but you can just have one if you want but you know
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.560]   boosters and by definition here in this video is is going to be a combination
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:10.440]   of substances okay so enough about that and so now one of the things about like
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.620]   okay well what I use to hold it you know and so I use good and I recommend
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.940]   using paper or glass and you don't want to use a glass you use on on on another
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.360]   booster right so you know that's why I use paper cups now I used to use these
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.380]   little jars but then you know I had to label them because if I used it for one
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:31.260]   thing I couldn't use that same driver again because the you know we talk a lot
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:36.020]   about glass using glass for you know plates or whatever on the in the
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.860]   telegram chat group but the glass will pick up the frequency you know you know
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.640]   and so I just you know I kind of went away from glass but paper cups are
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:48.200]   awesome you can just use a little paper cup or paper towel and you put it in
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.680]   there with it with the card and you know you're good to go throw the
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.400]   paper cup away and you're good so you know I was kind of like running out of
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.680]   you know jars and so that's kind of what I used to you know to hold the
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.920]   sources the supplements and you know paper cups are good for you know powders
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.200]   things that are powders because not everything comes in a tablet or capsule
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.820]   also good for liquids and you know for liquids too if you're copying the
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.140]   essential oil it's only takes one or two drops it doesn't take much you know
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.340]   powders you know teaspoon no that's it it doesn't take a lot you just have to
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:20.020]   have enough of the substance that you know that is recognizable and then and
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:24.940]   then basically step three is you just copy the frequency then you charge the
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.220]   cards remember there's a difference between copying a frequency and then
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.100]   charging up the up the object and why you want to charge up the object is you
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.740]   want to seal it in so that you can't get copied over okay and there's a
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:41.200]   whole other tutorial on copying and you know charging and stuff like that but
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.360]   that's the whole premise is copy the frequency charge the card and then you
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.720]   want to test it and that's really it steps one two three four five and that's
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.520]   how you do it so now I'm going to show you a little video on how I just recently
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.760]   just made the inflammation frequency but you know before I get into that I do
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:01.700]   want to kind of talk about the idea that there's three different kinds of
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:07.180]   frequencies in our reality okay and in our in our reality there's a
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.960]   theory frequencies and these are frequencies that are derived by healers
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:16.240]   and so if you go to the Leila Quantum Tech website you can kind of just you
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.960]   know basically they have a page about their healers and there's different
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.480]   healers a Roman is by far and you hear his name a lot he was in the most recent
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:30.960]   webinar that was on on Saturday you know Romans is incredible born gifted just
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.000]   unbelievably talented person and you've got these other ones as well you've got
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.780]   crew and on Agni and so forth and these individuals have come together as a
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:44.100]   team of healers and each in in their own right they're just well known and they
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:48.020]   do their own thing but they formed a healer network that has been producing
[00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:53.340]   these frequencies that are part of Leila Quantum Tech and these individuals
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:59.700]   have a gift and a talent for being able to and you know however you want to
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:04.260]   describe it for so some of you that you may understand how that's done but it
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.180]   takes someone very very special to basically be able to pull it from the
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.820]   universe you know and you know and some folks you know call it the Akashic
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.140]   records or the source frequencies things like that but but the idea that you can
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.900]   pull down something you know a frequency and you can put it into an object and
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.620]   then that object resonates with that frequency which are some of the most
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.760]   amazing frequencies that Leila Quantum Tech has I personally have experienced
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.940]   a lot of them and the ones that are the most potent for me are you know the
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:39.180]   inner peace frequency is it's exceptional at when you're going through
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:43.620]   emotional trauma inner peace is awesome I've tried weight loss I was that was
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.940]   wild and then you know the other ones sleep and rest and on and so forth so
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.020]   there's all of these different frequencies that are there and then so
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.740]   most of them are etheric and they're basically pulled down from the universe
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.080]   and then basically put into an object and this is not something any one of us
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.920]   can do that unless we're you know in that world and so those are their
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.460]   frequencies and I can't pull it off I personally just you know don't have that
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.320]   kind of skill so what I kind of tinker around in which is molecular frequency
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:18.200]   which is the frequency of physical substances and that's science you know
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.560]   if you go on YouTube and you just search on the the word molecular
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.880]   frequency you will come up with pages and pages and pages of physicists showing
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:30.900]   you how to calculate it because every single substance every single physical
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:35.440]   thing well okay well not everything's physical but I'll get one with it but
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.480]   every physical substance that we are we think is physical right is made up of
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:44.440]   atoms atoms or you know and then below the atoms or quantum quarks and things
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.400]   like that and and it's all basically it's what do they do they just if you
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.280]   think of an atom you know what is it right it's just made up of particles and
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:57.920]   the particles move around constantly and so that movement is is frequency you
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.840]   know it's it's energy right so everything has a frequency even even a
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.160]   rock has a frequency so the idea though is that there are you know there is
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.840]   molecular frequencies that's a well-known established scientific fact you can go
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:14.320]   on YouTube and read up and watch all about it it's really really really boring
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.120]   but you have you can calculate the frequencies the four molecular substances
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:24.240]   and use those in combination which is a booster and put it into a card and
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.160]   then once you have that frequency you can carry the card around you can put it
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.600]   into a capsule you can put it into your keys you can put it in your car you can
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.240]   do anything you want with that frequency that's you know aimed at helping you
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.040]   with something whatever that something might be you know like like my dog you know
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.800]   helping her calm down and it did work it does work okay and then the third type
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.760]   of frequency is sound resonant frequencies and sound is a type of
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.880]   frequency that I have not yet actually started playing with it's just
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.480]   something that you know it's kind of like there's so much in the world of
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:59.080]   molecular that that's where I've kind of just stayed but you know eventually I
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:02.800]   plan on getting into getting into sound frequencies I know people other people
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:07.520]   have tried it and so you know but it's just a third option I haven't tinkered
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.600]   around with it yet but you know it's definitely out there you can definitely
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.800]   do it and and I think the you know when as I eventually have more time because
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.120]   you know we all have day jobs you got to pay the bills you know as I have more
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.560]   time I think you know I want to definitely tinker around with sound a lot
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.920]   more than I do today because it's fascinating to me but I did want to
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.240]   share with you that there are there is a third frequency source that you can use
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.680]   for making boosters and that's you can use sound okay so now let's get into the
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.080]   one that I kind of tinker around in with most up till now which is the molecular
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.160]   frequency so let's go ahead and I just want I just put I've been making
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.400]   frequencies this year and this is we haven't quite figured out what the
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:49.680]   product names going to be for this but this one is called the you know it's
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.360]   basically to help the inflammation booster deal with inflammation so let's
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:58.360]   go ahead and or this is what I'm doing is basically you just need whatever
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:06.480]   you're going to use for supplements I use a paper cup the cube lock and blank
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:12.000]   hearts I use the envelope with labels system to keep them separated or keep
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.920]   them identified and then of course I've got the other ones so I'm going to make
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:21.400]   a information one two and three as described so that's what I'm doing
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.320]   right now and I'm gonna go ahead and do it basically you take your stuff and
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:30.720]   you put it in the cube lock those are your source frequencies that's all that
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:36.280]   supple that you see on the left two blank cards no frequency on it and now
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:42.040]   you're gonna copy the frequency for one minute that's it okay and then after the
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:46.480]   minutes over what you want to do is you want to take out the source right the
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.240]   the supplements and you want to leave the cards in for another two minutes so you
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.280]   give them a full charge and that means that once you've charged it for three
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:59.880]   minutes in the key block then it won't know other card unless well unless it's
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.280]   been in the eye block but no other you know my master set of frequencies are all
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.800]   the same and so you want to keep them all the same so all of them have been
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.720]   three minutes in the cube lock that way none of them will bleed over to the other
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.520]   in terms of copying it's you know one frequency on to another frequency card
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.680]   which is so important when you create a library and I have a huge library of
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.960]   cards so it's so important to make them all the same so everything gets three
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.600]   minutes in the cube lock and I store them all together so that none of them
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.440]   will then copy over to out to the other and that's it and so that really shows
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:38.160]   you how to do it it's so simple you take your source put in the card 60 seconds
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.000]   take the source out leave the card in there for another two minutes and then
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.520]   you're done and then you've got your frequency card and now the frequency of
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.560]   all of those supplements are now burned into the card now if you're gonna use
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.320]   the eye block or travel block you want to do 20 seconds to copy take the source
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:00.160]   out and leave it in for another basically 60 seconds total okay so it'd be like
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:06.040]   40 seconds to charge okay so that's how you do it it's that simple on how do you
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.160]   take a molecular and but I'll tell you though the trick is this step right here
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.920]   step one that is the key what do you use and will they all work together because
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.280]   you know the whole idea right is each one of these things has a molecular
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.960]   frequency and when you combine all those frequencies like this is what I call
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:28.200]   it I call it a harmonic and does that harmonic entrain with your bio field to
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.720]   do what you wanted it to do that's the whole goal and that's the key and you
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.000]   might have you might have one of these things and it's kind of off key and it
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.920]   throws off your whole frequency set or you might be missing something so I'll
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.920]   get into the story of the inflammation booster here and so it was the hardest
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.880]   one I ever made so that's how you do it now the next thing I want to point out
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.800]   and this is talk about sound because this has come up as a question quite often
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.720]   in the telegram chat group about how do I copy a sound so it's really very
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.320]   easy and there's you know a couple of ways you could do it but then so if you
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:07.200]   wanted to do a frequency you know using a frequency of sound one way to do it
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.480]   is if you're going to just do it is you know just using a little frequency
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.720]   generator attached to a speaker and then and then what you want to do is you want
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:20.520]   to imprint this the frequency into a water in an empty glass in a glass of
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.280]   water okay again you know you want to use a glass that hasn't been used for
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.680]   something like this before and you want to use the purest form of water you can
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.840]   find so distilled water would be best and then what happens is after five
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:38.360]   minutes or so the frequency gets copied the water picks it up it actually picks
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.240]   it up because what is water and water is a liquid crystal and a crystal will
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.760]   then begin to vibrate right with the resonant frequency of whatever you're
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.280]   playing to it and so then for a little while and it doesn't hold it on it
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.140]   doesn't hold it forever but for like instant right after you do it and I don't
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:57.200]   know what the timings are you know that's your monkey mind wants to put a number
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.680]   on everything but and I don't know what the number is but what I do or what I
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:06.640]   will do is and what intuitively I know to do okay I guess is the best way to say
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:11.400]   it what I intuitively know to do is I play the sound to the water and then the
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:16.400]   water will hold that sound the crystal the water is a crystal and it's and before
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.320]   it lets it go then I will put that into the cue block and use that as my source
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:25.000]   frequency so the whole idea here is you're going to want to use a frequency
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.080]   generator and they're really cheap a speaker you want to have some and I'm
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.920]   just telling you how to do it you want to have something called a BNC cable
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.960]   with alligator clips will connect the two together and then you want to have a
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.480]   glass of purified water so one of the things that I kind of want to point out
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:44.360]   with with I want to point out is that when you're doing this and I'll show you
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.000]   the frequency list later is it's really important and really really really
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.160]   important that that you know what what the range of frequencies of the device
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.200]   you're using can put out so this one puts out one hertz to 500 kilohertz
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.680]   which is important because then you want to know what's the right speaker to get
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:07.240]   so I know that this one will go 60 to 204 right and so the problem here was
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:12.440]   obviously I can't get anything below this will go 1 to 500 and this will go to
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.080]   20,000 kilohertz right so that's great I got the upper range but I can't if I
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.280]   want to play super low frequencies this speaker will not work because it starts
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.920]   at 60 hertz so you would need to find a speaker that can play if you want to do
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.240]   let's say 10 hertz then you're gonna you're gonna need to find a speaker that
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.280]   can play 10 hertz a 10 hertz sound okay so I just want to point out there's a
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.760]   real important little detail about frequency generators and what speaker
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.880]   you're going to use and then these are the kind of clips you want to get right
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.800]   right there this is a BNC cable and the two little alligator clips right here
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.160]   are going to clip onto the back of that speaker and then then you got it and you
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.480]   just go ahead and and you can play the frequency okay now what I'm talking
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:58.840]   about for resonant frequencies I want to point out that if you and for those of
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.760]   you aren't familiar with them in my background is bioelectromagnetics and I
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.200]   spent 20 years just studying and tinkering around with bioelectrics and and
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.760]   very well versed in it and so in that world there's the concept of of rife and
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.560]   I won't get into it but the whole idea though is you can use resonant frequencies
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.520]   to treat specific ailments and there's been a ton of scientists working on this
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.280]   it all kind of started with a guy named Raymond Reif and so if you go to this
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.640]   website and it's the CAFL which is electro at it's at the website called
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.600]   electro-arbalism and you look at the frequency list you can look up anything
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:40.040]   you want so let's say just pick something click here I want I have a loss of
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.640]   smell which interestingly enough a lot of people have right now because you know
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:49.980]   what so I never even knew it had a word no sima and so loss of smell and so if
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.480]   you wanted to kind of treat that issue then you would want to play 20 Hertz and
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.680]   10,000 which would be 10 kilohertz and those are the two frequencies combined
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:04.160]   have been found by people in the past scientists and whatever other tinkerers
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:10.440]   that would help alleviate this condition and so this is the master list of all of
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.480]   the frequencies that people over time and you can just see it just goes on and on
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.080]   and on and on and on and I mean there's so many different things I mean if you
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:23.360]   name a problem here you could pick any problem you want and you can have like
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:27.040]   you know hallucinations or whatever I mean it goes headaches you name it but
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.600]   there's all these different things that you know ailments conditions that you
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.160]   could have resonant frequencies that have been found to help alleviate the
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:41.640]   symptoms of and or solve we won't use the C word okay so that's the idea here is
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.760]   that you know those are the frequencies that I would plug into my frequency
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.520]   generator play to the water and then copy onto a card so that's one way of
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:53.280]   doing it okay using actual you know dial it in kind of thing another way to
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.880]   do it and this is probably the easiest way I'm just kind of nerdy so this is
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.120]   how this I have all this stuff I was doing other experiments I was actually
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:08.680]   never I won't go there anyway so so the other way the easier way to do it but I
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.480]   want to caveat the easier way to do it is you could use your computer all right
[00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.680]   or yours or your smartphone which is a computer and you could play a frequency
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:22.680]   right but the key to that and this is what is so important is you got to have
[00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.560]   really really good speakers you can have some you know cheapy speaker here the
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.160]   speaker on your phone ain't gonna be it you know you need precision speakers
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:35.680]   and so I actually own a pair of Bose you know computer speakers I mean Bose I
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:40.160]   mean you can't go wrong that's the top of the line best speakers in the world
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:45.040]   I'll just say it all up and I know there's others but I'm a Bose fan and so if
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:51.040]   you have really high super high quality speakers and you have a you know laptop
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:56.320]   or you know you know any device that'll play the sound then you could do that as
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.360]   well and you would basically put one speaker up against the water and then
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:05.080]   play the sound and the sounds you could play and the frequency can play again
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.240]   you could you could actually pick a frequency off of the consolidated
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:16.360]   Antonated frequency list if you just go to if I see I've got that if you go to
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:22.360]   the spooky if you just type this into YouTube spooky to frequencies for then
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.360]   what they've done is they've taken all of those kinds of CFL frequencies and
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.880]   they've made videos with it and it plays but you know and if it's not within a
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:34.400]   human hearing you might not hear it but it's playing okay so all of these
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:40.440]   videos at the spooky to website our YouTube channel have like just like here
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:45.640]   anti-aging skin college and building frequency frequency for viruses
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.320]   frequencies for memory improvement but all of these frequencies are right on
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.640]   YouTube and you can just play it right on your computer and again you have to
[00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.080]   have really good speakers and then you can put that into the water and use that
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.840]   as your source okay now there's other frequencies that you may not have heard
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.680]   about before it's and there's another set of frequencies and you again you can
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:09.200]   go on to YouTube and there's the nausea your frequencies and there's a doctor
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.720]   nausea and he did a whole bunch of he's kind of like another rife Raymond
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.880]   rife and so he went and discovered a whole bunch of frequencies that do a
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.800]   bunch of really great stuff so it's like cellular improving cellular
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.680]   functioning nutritional movement coordinate that sort of thing so the
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.200]   nausea frequencies just type that in YouTube and there you go here's some
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.800]   copies of the nausea frequencies and then there's also the sulfegio
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.160]   sulfegio frequencies themselves have just there's there's so many different
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.520]   sulfegio you just type in sulfegio in YouTube and you come up with all of
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:43.360]   these different things from DNA healing to sleep meditation full-body
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.480]   wellness you know all sorts of different things so those are the different
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:52.440]   kinds of frequencies you can find on YouTube and you just grab one play it
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:57.000]   glass of water and then copy that onto onto a card so those are those are they
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   know so that's another way of doing it that you know I just wanted to share
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.320]   with you so that you know you can go ahead and tinker with it again I haven't
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:11.560]   started yet I was doing this for a whole other thing and so but yeah it is
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:16.120]   definitely one way you can do it so again the three different ways to do you
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:21.320]   know basically frequencies is the etheric which are the the healer ones the
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:25.760]   molecular ones which is what a lot of the boosters are and of course sound now
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.200]   the last thing I want to do is talk about the by versus make you know which
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.120]   is I call the booster math so I wanted to share with you you know my
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.560]   spreadsheet and so I've been keeping a spreadsheet for a while now and this is
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.360]   the men's booster this is what was in is in it's in the men's booster except
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:45.000]   for the pink I kind of did myself a personal upgrade last year but basically
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.320]   everything in blue and black is what's in the men's booster that's on sale at
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.920]   Layla website and so the whole idea here is the by versus make and so one of the
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:57.120]   things about you know collecting all of these substances is well they're not
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:03.880]   free right and so the original the original men's booster had about it had
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:07.800]   all of these different components right the five different components each one
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:12.280]   of them has its own set of substances and every one of those things has came out
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:18.360]   of cost and when the original Ryardin stem kind was one of the most expensive
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:23.040]   as a stem cell boost you know boosting and booster body to produce more stem
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.320]   cells as part of the anti-aging booster inside the men's booster you know it's
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:30.880]   very expensive one little tiny bottle that was like 72 bucks right I've since
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.640]   added spermidine to it which is really awesome helps you with autophagy when
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.360]   you're you're fasting and things like that but the whole idea though is you
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:44.160]   know there's a lot of money I that I it costs to make these boosters and so just
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:49.480]   to kind of give you an idea the men's booster if like this is the newest one
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:53.720]   right now the total cost is eleven hundred thirty six dollars if you wanted
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.600]   to make it yourself or you can go on the website and buy it I think for like
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.960]   seventy bucks or something I don't know what they cost now but you know so
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.800]   there you go right so should you make your own could you make your own yeah
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.280]   absolutely go for it but if you look at something you go I want this but I don't
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.480]   want to pay a thousand dollars yeah there's a lot cheaper to buy so there's
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:16.480]   your make versus buy it's not cheap and I want to point that out when you know
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.640]   making these boosters is not cheap I mean just the the anti-aging boosters like
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.400]   500 bucks just to put together all of this stuff if you don't already have it
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:28.080]   at home and you know before I made this I would say that I'd had about half of
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.520]   this stuff and then I had to go out hunting for the rest right and buying it
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:35.640]   so this was the men's booster it has the brain booster all the stuff in that
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.240]   one testosterone immune stress anti-aging and you know it's got everything in
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.120]   it everything that this is like one separate individual booster just
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.400]   immune system okay stress anti-aging so forth so that's what I did for that now
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.920]   when I did the woman's booster I swapped out the testosterone because women
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:57.280]   definitely only need that but not in the quantities we do and I took this out and
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.880]   I swapped it out with this one so I added three hundred sixty nine dollars worth
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.720]   of with the supplements and then copied that and created what I called the
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:10.240]   wahini which is one component of the five and I created the woman's booster
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.680]   and with the woman's booster as it stands right now that cost me a thousand
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:18.400]   twenty two dollars just to buy again you know it's like four dollars anti-aging
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.880]   so forth but it was it was three hundred sixty nine dollars that I spent I mean
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.320]   one bottle it's like four forty bucks right here these are these two different
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.880]   components so it's not cheap and so there's the whole by versus make your own math
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:35.440]   and so this is why I started making these because I figured hey you know I could
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.680]   I could make something for myself and then why not share it right so that other
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.200]   people who don't have a thousand dollars could go and benefit from these
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.640]   frequency sets so now I also want to kind of just walk you through some of
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.640]   the stuff that I've been working on since last year and it you know and I'll
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:54.080]   tell you which ones working which ones didn't but I tried to make an energy
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:35:00.800]   booster oh and by the way how I test is as an affiliate of Leila Q I have
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:05.440]   access to uh Philip and Roman and so I will send them in and then they
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.040]   evaluate them and give me a thumbs up or a thumbs down and I get more thumbs
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:13.520]   down so then I get thumbs up you know and so sometimes like I put like 250
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.440]   bucks into kind of creating something that I thought would be like
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.400]   you know I you know I need something that's going to boost my energy like
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.760]   drinking up you know you know a little you know one of those I don't drink
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.480]   them but an energy drink right and I was like yeah I can make a
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:31.280]   frequency for that and I made one up and then Roman you know tested it and he
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.560]   said it just made him jittery it was just like not good and not good at all
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.000]   it's like a bad caffeine rush and he's like no this is not good so you know
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.800]   there's 250 bucks down during it and so and then of course I did make the
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.880]   allergy booster which was phenomenal but that one's getting renamed by the
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.440]   way the lawyers are ground involved and we got to rename bunch stuff on the
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:54.080]   website or not we but Philip has to rename some stuff to kind of make you
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:58.560]   know everybody happy and so I think we're going to rename that thing
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.440]   something I think we're going to call it seasons or something but the whole
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:05.840]   idea though is this is what's in that one booster so you know 168 dollars so
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.960]   you can obviously you know if you can afford it make your own and make your
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.560]   own allergy booster and this one's geared towards seasonal allergies right
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:17.040]   hayfie rear that sort of thing not you know and the whole allergy of you know
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.280]   allergy for food is different allergy than allergy you know for like you know
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.600]   hayfie rear and stuff like that so different types of allergies but
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:27.200]   that's what I designed it for and I don't even remember why I think it was
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.640]   because jeez I'm trying to remember back it was like a couple years ago but
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.200]   I think with somebody I saw a friend of mine had allergies and they wanted
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.480]   something so I made it for them and then and then I gave it to Philip and it
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.280]   worked now I tried one I tried to make a booster called cardio booster you know
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.560]   at 287 dollars where the supplements put together and this was
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:49.680]   to help and this is well the reason I made this one was I was trying to
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.280]   figure out something that could help people who had taken the
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:57.040]   you know the thing that nobody wants to take and they keep making you take
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.960]   more and and and and then we heard so many different
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.480]   you know reports of people having blood issues right clotting and things like
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.200]   that so I wanted to kind of see if I could make a
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.600]   frequency that would help those people who had taken the thing
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.360]   because they were having blood issues and so I put together this you know I
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.560]   did all the research and this is all the stuff that boosts
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.600]   your cardio performance and helps your blood
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.440]   and this one you know when Roman evaluated it he just said it was just
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.640]   too weak he said you know he said he could sense
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.040]   what it was trying to do but it wasn't strong enough
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.920]   and it just wasn't strong enough and so it didn't make the cut so some of
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.360]   these boosters I make you know that you'll never you'll never see
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.000]   and it just didn't make the cut and so that was another investment that I
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.600]   tried to make a booster try to help people
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.480]   you know this one was trying to help me
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.480]   my friends other people and then of course I made the inflammation booster
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.640]   which is I don't know what we're going to call it yet
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:56.080]   but it is it did pass the mustard or the roman test
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:00.560]   and so in that one basically you know these are again all the research that I
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.680]   made and the thing about this one and I want to share with you
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.640]   is that the reason I made three if you saw in the video
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.720]   was I made three different versions of this
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:14.800]   I made one with just supplements I made one with just pharmaceuticals
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.920]   over the counter pharmaceuticals and prescriptions
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.320]   for inflammation right and then I made one with both and so it was
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.600]   basically prototype one two and three I sent them in
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:30.400]   and then basically you know Roman and Philip evaluated them and they said hey
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.840]   you know what number three is the best one so
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.920]   blending the pharmaceuticals with the natural supplements
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:42.480]   was the best one but Roman was like you know but it's just missing something
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.520]   it's missing something it doesn't kind of it doesn't you know really make
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.880]   make you know make it doesn't do what it's supposed to do
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:54.560]   so then he recommended that I add a couple of different frequencies to it
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.880]   that he that he intuitively knew and he's because he's Roman
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.160]   that would help that would actually you know push it over the edge
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.680]   and and get it to work and so when he told me you know try
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.920]   adding a couple of things to it so I went out and I sourced those items and I
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:13.680]   added it and then I just then when I was at it I kind of came up with my own
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.640]   intuitively that maybe I should add these other things as well so I added
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:21.360]   four different substances to it then I sent it back in
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.960]   and boom you know he's like yeah it absolutely does what it's supposed to do
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.760]   you know it'll help you know reduce inflammation in the body
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.800]   which helps relieve pain and things like that so we're not sure what we're
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.280]   going to name this one it hasn't come out on the website yet
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.440]   but it definitely passed the Roman test and it took three tries so I ended up
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:41.520]   having you know prototype four and a prototype five
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:45.120]   that I sent in before actually number five actually came out
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.160]   the best one so that's kind of what it so it's like three hundred eighty six
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.760]   dollars worth of stuff that went into that one
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.280]   particular booster so you know if you're looking at hey I want to
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:00.800]   work on my inflammation you know and and and and it's kind of like relief
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.760]   relief right then you can you know obviously make your own here's the
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.520]   list right here or or just or buy it versus I mean
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.400]   something bucks when it comes out and then so that's that
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.280]   the other thing I did want to mention though it's part of my research
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.920]   that if you do look at the calf that calf the
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:21.760]   cantonated antonated whatever list consolidated antonated frequency list
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.280]   I say that three times fast you know there are there are frequencies there are
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.320]   sound frequencies resonant frequencies for
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.360]   inflammation it was seven twenty seven seven eighty seven you know these are all
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.200]   Hertz frequencies and of course there's your frequency is G
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:42.000]   the G gave them alphabet alphabetical designations it's 147 Hertz and then I
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.440]   looked at another one Clark with hold of Clark didn't have one
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:49.040]   selected spooky two they had back pain research but they didn't have a
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:52.080]   specific one for inflammation but the whole idea though is I did look at
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.840]   resident frequencies which I didn't add to this
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.520]   it was just something like okay if it comes back in prototype five is not
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.800]   working just yet I was gonna add these two but once I got the green light the
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.480]   prototype five work I didn't need to add the resident frequencies but I just
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.040]   want to point it out that you can also go to those to
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.320]   help with inflammation or any of these other things so I just wanted to point
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:16.480]   out that that was part of my research here you go here's my prototypes before
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.800]   I finally got got it approved and so that was that one and of course the
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.440]   comfor dogs the one I just talked about earlier you
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.160]   know I just right out of the gate this is what I ended up with the actual list
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.560]   was a lot longer and I just kept taking stuff in
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.240]   out you know I just went through each one of these things and I just dropped a
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.720]   bunch of stuff and this is what was left after I did my
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.360]   my dowsing and yeah it really worked out really well
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:43.440]   that one cost 191 dollars and then this is the one I'm working on right now
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:48.320]   guys I've been doing a ton of research on third eye
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:51.120]   awakening and you know I've got and you know
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.800]   one of the members and and god bless him you know just reached out to me and
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.160]   was and helped me sent me some frequencies to add to it
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:02.240]   and so I've got some of the frequencies I just haven't put them all together
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:06.240]   my day job has been just unbelievably busy the last three months and I
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.000]   finally coming up for air but this is the list right now that I'm working on
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.040]   and this is the whole development process where I kind of start out with
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.680]   you know it's like maybe you know using some peptides
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.160]   there's two different peptides that are good for a brain
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.640]   of course and you know I'm gonna sorry for third eye
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.600]   awakening you know you want to stimulate your brain right so these are
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.760]   pineal issues so there's a pineal pineal on peptide and a
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.680]   certain peptide that are helping your brain
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.480]   for the third eye working I just haven't put this together yet but this is my
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.680]   rough draft list of course there's different
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:41.600]   types of substances and molecular substances and so forth there's
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.800]   different kinds of of mycelium that we could use and of course I haven't even
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.480]   gotten into the frequencies yet but this is how my development
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.160]   cycle works I just start researching I start making the list and then I
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.440]   start whittling it down through intuition and dowsing
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.880]   come up with you know like what it's going to be the final prototype
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.360]   I'll make one or two different prototypes and then
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:04.480]   send them in to see what happens and and go from there but
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:08.320]   yeah so far this just right at the beginning stages is probably one of the
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.480]   most complex boosters I've ever tried to make
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.240]   you know to basically decalcify the pineal gland and at the same time
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.320]   stimulate it to open and that's something I really want to do it's in
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.480]   this one's for me because I just that you know that's my lifelong goal
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:29.200]   is to just open that third eye and connect so and that's kind of what I'm
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.080]   working on now so I just wanted to share that just kind of give you an idea
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.440]   of the development process and sometimes they work sometimes they don't
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.240]   now how do you test it if you don't have access
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.880]   to fill up enrollment in that capacity well if you want to test it
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.240]   then by all means and this is again we go back to this
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.360]   is you go back to your dowsing and muscle testing
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:54.320]   and see how it works now before I even sent the calm for dogs
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:44:00.160]   into into Roman and Philip I basically had three friends who had
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:05.920]   really really really hyperactive dogs and and I sent it to them
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.680]   three different dogs three different places and I made them the same dog
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.040]   collar I made for my dogs that was infused with a brass ball
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.200]   chain necklace infused with with the calm for dog
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:23.600]   frequency and I gave it to them and of the three folks
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:28.240]   one it did absolutely nothing for and then two they said it was like they
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.840]   could they that they it was like really harder it was very subjective
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.480]   but they were saying like they kind of noticed the difference but
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.800]   they weren't like sure that it did any difference at all
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.240]   and the only for sure that I knew was I tried it on my own dog
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.400]   and I noticed and this is how I noticed was
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.880]   whenever we were having thunderstorms in the spring
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.200]   you know she would full on out panting trembling
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.800]   I had to hold her you know and then after I put the the
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.480]   collar on her she would still tremble and get nervous and hide under my desk
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.080]   and want to cuddle but she was no longer panting like
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:04.160]   all out freaking out when the thunder was on and then we just went through
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:08.320]   July 4 and you know the people around me have been blowing fireworks off for
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:12.800]   three weeks I mean people in Missouri love fireworks everybody
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.920]   and they started like three weeks ago and every single night they're blown
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.160]   out of fireworks all around the neighborhood
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.440]   and so my poor little dog was was really nervous but
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.720]   what was amazing was she never got full on out
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.600]   panting you know you know if you have a little dog or you have any dog that's
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.800]   got anxiety but more so just she got scared
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.120]   you could tell that she was scared and a little bit of trembling
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.560]   and then the worst worst of it I had to actually give her
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:40.240]   her medication for it but mostly I could tell that it was doing something so I
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.440]   sent it in because I was like all right you know I tested it myself like
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.640]   you know four different dogs three of them you know you know just I didn't get
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.360]   the feedback I wanted but it's like I saw it in my own dog so I'm thinking
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:53.120]   well it's got to do something because you know again quantum energy doesn't
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.800]   work on everybody it does something but you know it's like
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.520]   but whether or not you pick up on it or not you know it's completely up to you
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:03.040]   we're all individuals but because I saw one out of four
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:07.680]   I actually had a you know had a positive you know reaction to it
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.040]   I sent it in and sure enough I mean Roman I think Philip was telling me that
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:15.040]   Roman had a friend of his dog who had anxiety
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:19.440]   he you know I don't know how he did it exactly physically but
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.120]   the dog was exposed to the frequency the calm for dogs
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:27.360]   and that dog immediately had a physical reaction
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.720]   you know it calmed down and he could sense that because Roman could sense
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.200]   stuff so Roman could say yeah definitely that that
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.080]   definitely helped that dog it helped it actually even helped
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.840]   with pain so I was like really really happy about that so
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.240]   so that's another one that's going to be coming out soon so
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.000]   yeah I keep working on new ones I only do like you know it costs a lot of money
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.840]   and it takes a lot of time you know it takes months to develop one of these
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.080]   because of the amount of research that I'm doing
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.360]   but you know it's so well worth it right in my mind because I use my own
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:58.800]   frequencies I'm wearing my own men's heel capsule right now
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.480]   that I made by myself so you know by all means if you have a block
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:07.120]   this is how you do it this is how you make your own frequency booster
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:11.440]   you can use any one of the you know the three frequency types
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.080]   which you know whether you can pull out a plot a
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:18.640]   etheric frequency you know that's very you know I kudos to you if you can do it
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:21.680]   but that's how you do it these are the different ways to do it
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:25.040]   and I highly encourage that you you know you take that investment
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.800]   that you've made in getting a block and you know and optimize it because
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:32.480]   there's so many different things I have so many different ideas for other
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.880]   boosters I mean third eye awakening is taking all my
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.440]   time right now but you know because of that thing that
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.520]   everybody was exposed to not the not the not the thing but the other thing that
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.960]   they made us or they tried to make it mandatory so you could work
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.560]   and live and be a human being in our society thing
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:53.600]   that thing you know is causing a lot of fertility issues as you may well know
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.400]   and so one of the thoughts that I had was you know okay my one of my boosters
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.200]   I'd like to work on next is you know a contraception
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.400]   booster right or I'm sorry a fertility booster
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.280]   and so forth you know there's just so many different ideas
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.080]   that I have in terms of making boosters to help people
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:12.160]   and help my own life you know so and you know by all means in your own world
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.560]   what could you do and what could you put together
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:18.240]   you know and go for it just try if you got it on hand go for it so I just
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:21.200]   really want to encourage you to really really leverage
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.320]   your investment and get the most out of your Layla Q products okay
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.520]   so anyway that wraps up this tutorial on how to make a frequency booster
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.560]   I hope this was informative for you I just want to share
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.280]   everything that I do and how I do it there's no secrets here
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:36.400]   full transparency you know do it yourself you know you you paid a
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:40.000]   bunch of money for this thing go out there and and and and explore what's
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.840]   possible really so thank you so much for you know
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:47.600]   watching this video I hope that this tutorial was helpful to you again
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.480]   now if you ever want to reach out and ask questions
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.960]   you know that I'm one of the moderators and I frequent the
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:56.560]   quantum power group on telegram frequently I'm out there
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:59.280]   and I'm sorry if I don't answer all your questions but I'm kind of like
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:03.680]   fill up where I you know I just you know and it's just it's a lot
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:07.120]   and so like I said the day jobs killing me right now
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.400]   but I do try to answer the questions as I see them and also too if you want to
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.320]   come visit me at the Tinkers Academy that's my
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.960]   blog and and like I said I wanted to show you my
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.560]   blog one more time shameless plug but if you go to my blog which is the
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.080]   Tinkers Academy so you just type in tinkers.academy
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.840]   in your you are all window and it'll pop up
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:29.120]   my blog and if you go to the quantum energy site right here
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:33.360]   then basically it's these are all the boosters that I made and you can kind of
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.000]   like look at the list of all the supplements that are in them
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.920]   here's the list of supplies for all the stuff if you want to make your own
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.880]   there's a library I put together a library for you folks
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.160]   for anyone who's interested in quantum healing and so forth and you haven't
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.240]   you don't really you know kind of like what is this
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.120]   you know here's all of my here's my personal library on quantum healing and
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:54.640]   frequency medicine so you know by all means you know it's free
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.920]   you know help yourself and then the other idea here too that I want to point
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.640]   out is that if you click right here this is the
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:05.600]   Layla quantum tech page on my blog here's the list of tutorials
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:09.120]   and here's the list of the charging times which is where I got those numbers
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.080]   so if you're interested like here basically it's like right here
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:16.000]   qblock iblock and I remember the travel block is the same as an iblock
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.680]   before you ever if any if before you upgrade it you know people upgrade their
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.480]   iblocks but if you got an iblock right off the shelf
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.720]   it's the same as a travel block okay in terms of charging and frequency
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:30.240]   charging and copying frequencies so basically that's where I got the
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:34.160]   one minute one minute here three minutes to charge
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.440]   sixty seconds to charge right that sort of thing and then you get down to
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.800]   this copying frequency times that's where I got these numbers
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.680]   so these were in the other tutorials that we had
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:47.680]   the Philip and I did so that's where you'll find tutorials you'll find the
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:51.280]   charging times the comparison tables and then all of the different tutorials
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.960]   right on my blog and so there you go again I
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:59.520]   wanted to say thank you so much for for watching this video I hope this again
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.560]   one more time I really hope that this helps you
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:05.920]   because that's the whole point of this is is you know we're a community
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.920]   and I want to share and I want to help and if I can answer your questions and
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:13.280]   help you make your own frequency boosters and by all means just ask me
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.320]   and I'll be happy to see if I can see whatever I can do okay
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.120]   so anyway thanks a lot everybody and have a great day
