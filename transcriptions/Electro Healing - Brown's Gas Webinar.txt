[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy Electro healing video I'm your host
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.740]   Kilmer and in this video I'd like to share with you a great conversation we just had
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.380]   about Browns gas it actually was the first Browns gas webinar we've ever held with Ben
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.800]   from h2 biohacker and the topic of the of the webinar was testimonials you know what
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.440]   are people experiencing what are we hearing about folks that are using Browns gas and
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.400]   how it's helping them with different things so we thought we'd just put this together
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.520]   invite some folks in the chat group and sure enough we had a small group but we learned
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.560]   some really interesting things from each other and I think it's just a great way to kind
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.060]   of learn about you know different ways you could use Browns gas to help you with your
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.640]   health and wellness so before we jump into the webinar I do want to do a disclaimer make
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.400]   sure everyone's you know keeping all the government agencies happy here the information in this

[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.880]   or treatment and before undertaking a new health care measurement and never disregard
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.400]   professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you've heard on the
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.400]   internet the Tinkers Academy does not recommend or endorse any specific tests physicians,

[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.880]   on any information covered is solely at your own risk alright so what did we talk about
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.240]   today well it was testimonials so this is Browns gas we cover that in the webinar just
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.920]   a quick you know brief introduction and we really hit on how Browns gas is helping people
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.440]   you know what is Ben hearing from his customers and some and a couple of us in the webinar
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.560]   chimed in with our own experiences about helping with sports recovery pain relief helping
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.200]   with skin helping with you know actually its effects on dreams its effects on meditation
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.480]   and it effects on on sickness and illness so I want you to know that if you're you know
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.840]   any of these things kind of fall under your category you know we did cover it and how
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.840]   brands gas works with that so I really hope you enjoy the discussion I did and I just want
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.720]   to say thank you to Ben from H2 BiHacker thank you for the folks that participated really
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.480]   appreciate your time and interest and and and overall just joining in on on helping our
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.480]   community here learn more about it because the best way to learn is from each other so
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.120]   thank you very much we're going to go ahead and jump right into the webinar now and if
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.040]   you want to learn more about Browns gas I've got a page on my blog this is the Tinkers
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.880]   Academy all the links by the way for all the stuff that we talk about will be in the video
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.000]   description below so at the Tinkers Academy there's a whole page dedicated to Browns gas
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.480]   and all the different videos I've done on it all the different information everything from
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.580]   the you brown patents and you name it and then also to there's over at the telegram we have
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.960]   an H2 or H2 H HO which is also bronze gas the telegram chat group that I just mentioned
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.160]   so there's a link there to join it if you want to ask questions learn more about Browns
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.200]   gas and or get a hold of Ben get a hold of other folks out there in the industry that
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.600]   are selling Browns gas generators so it's a great webinar again thank you to everybody
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.080]   that participated and here we go let's start the webinar all right well everybody welcome
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.940]   to the first ever Browns gas user webinar we've just got a few folks interested in talking
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:23.400]   about Browns gas learning about Browns gas focused primarily on user testimonials and
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.720]   and what you know what we the community have learned about using and experimenting and
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.400]   trying out Browns gas and today we've got Ben from H2 Genesis on to kind of walk through
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.840]   what he's been learning and some of the testimonials he's gotten from his customers and so we've
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.160]   and we're open to questions and you know we'll just go from there but this is the first ever
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.480]   Browns gas webinar for people that want to use it and we're thinking about having it
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.720]   once a month for people that want to jump in ask questions as they get their machines
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.880]   and try them out and want to tinker around so yeah welcome Ben and welcome Mandy and
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.480]   EMA thank you so much for joining the webinar it's the first one so I think we're making
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.920]   history I hope but anyway hey Ben good morning or good afternoon and yeah so how you doing
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.880]   hello yeah I'm here good good very good ironically as we're setting up the meeting here you know
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:22.040]   testimonials on one of my clients was just riding his bike mountain bike I mean I live
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.840]   out in the jungle in Costa Rica currently you know back between US and Costa Rica I travel
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.560]   but nowadays they're not I mean Costa Rica so I'm out in the jungle and one of my clients
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.920]   that is a healing center on the back rows from where I live a few miles away just rides
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.520]   by on this mountain bike and I'm like hey you got any quick testimonials to give me
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.560]   which what are your thoughts as he's passive by as we're about to start this but yeah so
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.440]   yeah I'll tell you some history in a minute as well but coincidence cool alright so let's
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.920]   start off with you know like for anyone that's just gonna pop in and hear this video you
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.920]   know I think like if we could do a quick like you know we've done other videos by the way
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.600]   I'll put all the links in the video description prior interviews background things like that
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.040]   but just if you could you give us a five minute for anyone who's new to Brown's gas five minutes
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.320]   you know real quick like what is it and you know and in in like what's your elevator
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.040]   speech when someone says well you make what kind of generators what's your five what's
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.360]   your elevator speech for this how would you explain it to someone had never heard about
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:37.600]   before um I may I start with mostly the hydrogen because there's so much research already out
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.920]   there and that's what has the most um yeah I guess research and scientific papers done
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.120]   on is just hydrogen general and there's a lot of information out there already so once
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.640]   you get into the hydrogen and it's easy to pull up those kind of studies and testimonials
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:01.240]   and then from there I go into you know okay well we're kind of experimenting and moving
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.680]   that's and this is our past that but there may be additional benefits the Brown's gas
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:13.640]   um and I guess the way you define Brown's gas is um well mostly I mean the newer hydrogen
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:19.400]   generator machines they use a proton exchange membrane without an electrolyte in the in
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:26.160]   the mix um so the traditional Brown's gas generators use a pure electrolyte you know
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:34.920]   a water with a very alkaline um you know powder like sodium hydroxide um and so there's
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.640]   a lot of free space in between the electrolytes in there instead of there's water liquid in
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:46.480]   there the electrolyte mix instead of the special membrane made made by DuPont that membrane
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.520]   allows you to separate the oxygen and hydrogen but with Brown gas that's not the case every
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.680]   all the gases are just made in the same liquid uh medium at the same time so that's the main
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.440]   difference and it's you know with your eyes in the in the community and it's been I guess
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.600]   it in some studies on this a lot of experiments don't need to be done but a lot of us suspect
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.880]   that there's some additional benefits the Brown's gas you know made using the electrolyte
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.160]   mix rather than the proton exchange membrane which separates the hydrogen oxygen you know
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:24.560]   we can go on in more detail later yeah so I have to diagram up on the screen so uh what
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:31.760]   you're looking at folks is a typical hydrogen generator which produces hydrogen gas uh there's
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:38.000]   a what they call a proton exchange membrane or a PEM membrane between the two uh rods
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.960]   that are being you know during an electrolysis pro electrolysis process so hydrogen comes off
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.840]   one side one the cathode and oxygen comes off the other side on the anode and this is your typical
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:54.080]   way to create hydrogen so every hydrogen machine out there right uh this is how it's set up on the
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.640]   inside and then you're breathing out the the hydrogen and then if you in and some of some
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.480]   some machines will actually have a port where they're pumping out oxygen so you can actually
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.120]   pull off both gases otherwise it's just they're just gassed out the back of the machine and you're
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:14.480]   just getting hydrogen so um now for it now what the difference is is and this is my old video I'm
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:21.200]   just trying to find the trying to find the slide right as you were talking about just like yourself
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.640]   I had to make us I had to make my own slide so where is it I know it's in here somewhere I remember
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:33.280]   making it the way that you can get an image on out there yeah and then so here's the difference
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.600]   so you want to explain the difference then now so what happens then if you don't have that
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:43.280]   proton exchange membrane in the in the electrolysis process and that's bronze gadget maybe politically
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:50.560]   right exactly um I've got a more specific image that may show some of the details on um our home
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:56.240]   page an image oh sure pull that up basically what you've got here okay let me go ahead go to your
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:06.880]   home okay you know just that just so we don't so um that way everybody kind of gets a kind of an
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:12.400]   idea so like this guy right here right there yeah yeah it's like very simplified your diagram
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:18.000]   but it's basically the same thing but in addition to what what may make grounds gas differences
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.040]   what some people call electrically expanded water or ionized water or water a water molecule charged
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:31.680]   with two extra electrons and what that does it seems is um the the two hydrogen instead of having
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:37.200]   that angle you know a hundred and two three four degrees whatever it is that angle it expands more
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.280]   and the water becomes more the molecule becomes more linear those extra electrons push the hydrogen
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:49.280]   which are positive away from each other and in that state of water when it's charged like that
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.760]   um hydrogen atoms are further apart from each other um it's theorized that that can actually
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:02.480]   actually be a gaseous form of water and so that will in like shown in this diagram that's
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:09.600]   only created in a liquid state that doesn't seem to be created in a um in a machine with the
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.800]   proton exchange membrane so that's an additional benefit but what we theorize that may be happening
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:21.680]   is that the extra electrons charge into the water molecule um there it's not super stable um
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.160]   there's a specific name for that that's in a document we'll look to as well
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.760]   but um the electrons will later later possibly release inside the body which give additional
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.960]   electrons to the body for healing and the effect of that is similar to what some people call
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:44.480]   earthing or grounding which naturally the earth has an electrical charge um and it's also theorized
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:50.080]   that the you know trees and life and all that are the electrons because the atmosphere and clouds
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.840]   above us are more positively charged ground is nearly charged that they creates that um
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:02.960]   difference in potential and the things closer or higher up in the sky they are able to draw up
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.600]   the electrons from the ground so if we evolve this a species touching the ground walking on our
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.840]   bare feet you know on the ground which is conductive we're absorbing much more electrons
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:18.080]   in sort of as that these electron extra electrons maybe helping people in this why somebody's
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:25.120]   grounding in earthing techniques and modalities may benefit as well hmm okay all right there you
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.320]   go uh hey i don't know if there's anyone uh email or mandy if you had a question about any of this
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:39.040]   before we jump into testimonials okay just let me know if you want to jump in uh okay so that sort
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:45.120]   of explains the difference you got a regular h2 generator oxygen and hydrogen only
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.880]   and you've got a browns gas generator you take out that membrane and you've got hydrogen oxygen
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:57.600]   and you've got this additional output which is referred to as expanded or electrically expanded
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:03.600]   water gas uh you know and there's actually really interesting i think at the 2019 water
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:10.080]   conference there was a discussion about whether or not this gas would also possibly be uh what
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:15.440]   pollock believes uh is uh structured water the fourth phase of water right so it's some real
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.880]   interesting stuff but we won't get too much into that this science of it one last thing to mention
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:27.680]   yeah on this topic is um if you jump to the h2 genesis page there's a link to that document
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:33.520]   which it goes into more details on a on a study it in the in a spectral analysis exactly the plasma
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.920]   over those yeah for anyone interesting i'll i'll put a link to this document it's also on on
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:44.320]   ben's website um and it it really talks a lot about what just ben just described which is the bond
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:50.400]   angular bond uh connections between the hydrogen atoms and what happens when
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:56.960]   the extra electrons affect the water molecule and it's just really amazing that a water molecule
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:03.360]   in this state has different properties uh just because it's the same combination h2o but when it's
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.320]   got extra electrons what happens when you take in this molecule those electro i guess the theory
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:15.280]   right ben is the extra electrons immediately go because it's unstable go into your body so you get
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:22.480]   kind of like you're basically drinking electrons right right in the way uh hum it seems like it's
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.520]   only stable this molecule is only stable and i think they call it a risenberg cluster or something
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:37.440]   like that so along with other o2 and h2 atoms or molecules really um these molecules can only stay
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:44.160]   stable amongst themselves in the way they were created kind of like a gel um but once they start
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.400]   touching other tissues and come in contact with other molecules and substances you know they
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.280]   quickly break down and release their electrons yeah plasma water there you go okay well that's
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:59.280]   really really fascinating stuff uh okay so let's jump into uh i guess the discussion today it was
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:04.560]   going to revolve around um just you know the different uh i think we've you've got just by the
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:11.760]   way this is ben's website uh and he's got a really good section here on research tons of different
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:19.200]   papers as well as a section over here uh on testimonials so um you know feel free that if you're
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:25.440]   interested in learning more uh ben's website is uh just a you know a treasure trove of information so
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.440]   so we're yeah i'll go ahead ben one just go ahead and take over and and just want you know share with
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:35.760]   us uh you know like what are people using uh your product which is a ben browns gas generator
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.400]   you know uh what are they using it for and how and what and what are the results you want to go to the
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:47.760]   testimonial page um yeah whatever yeah well actually um the the audio testimonials there um you know
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.640]   we can people can jump in here and listen to them later but they're actually given to a friend
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:58.240]   given to me by friend of mine who uh just rode by this mountain bike i just mentioned earlier um so
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:04.560]   i i i quickly asked him to what are the main takeaways that you like to share with us that um
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.680]   your experience you know what's the most notable things you've you've experienced and because he's um
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:16.480]   there's a pro tennis player back in his 20s um also mountain biking and biking and racing all
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:22.560]   that kind of stuff really like an athlete um and he says the biggest thing the first thing he said
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:28.320]   was like recovery he's like you know he's 50 years old now you know you mean him but same age you
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:34.800]   know grew up you know in lana for a while together but um he tells me the main thing that he notices
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.280]   recovery he's like i feel like him in my 20s again and then they're really stuck out with me he's like
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:44.480]   because he knows his body and he trains like an athlete so he's lying his bike up and down the
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:49.200]   mountain tier and in Costa Rica on these you know dirt roads and he's like i can recover now like
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.320]   i was back in my 20s he's like that's huge you know he's like he's got a new life you know because
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.720]   he's like you know he wasn't that before but he feels like he's young again so he's excited about
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.600]   getting out there and exercising and doing more so um and this is a i think a common thing that's
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.360]   going to come up into many testimonies like it makes you younger it makes you feel younger you
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:13.280]   can do more things you know with with the thing body you've got a your old old young body of that
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:19.200]   again yeah well yeah i mean yeah it's got all comes down to electrons but there's a little bit
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.680]   there's more though that's what we don't know about brown skies yet is that it's more than just
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.720]   you know brown sky i mean just electrons free electrons it's more than just hydrogen and oxygen
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.320]   but yeah yeah because you're saturating your body with hydrogen and oxygen yeah
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:39.520]   right in this case he also mentioned um within a couple days after starting it some of his achy
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:46.160]   joints went away you know shoulder palm and elbow palm those you know weird aches went away really
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:51.120]   quickly um you know with the first few days he's like wow you know he's thinking it's a quincy
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.760]   or what but i that's one of the you know hearing back from a lot of clients that's one of the first
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.920]   things they mentioned so i can bend i don't know if this is a coincidence or not but you know just
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:04.400]   you know one or two days after using this ache in my shoulder or knee or wrist you know it's gone away
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.280]   but you know i would say it's a coincidence you know hearing it from one person but you know i hear
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:15.520]   from four or five six people you know it's it's becoming more common so it's something to consider
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.120]   okay so you want to kind of just you want to go down this list or did you have kind of like
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:27.440]   your own notes uh about yeah i've got a few i've got a few that not written down here yet so um
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:32.240]   it'd be good to save those that are written down for people to uh the look at later and um
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:38.160]   i've got a couple interesting new ones that haven't added yet i'll mention um another friend of mine
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:44.400]   here who again he had some early aches and pains go away um he's one that i mentioned there that um
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:52.400]   he uses a um heart math you know that uh he's into the heart rate variability you know um
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:58.080]   biofeedback type of stuff yeah he said he was never able to get a uh a reading back that his
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:04.240]   he was in a coherent state um but until he started using or inhaling the the brown's gas
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.560]   the idea he was having a scene so he was like really excited about that that he was trying to
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.040]   make progress you know say mentally and spiritually and that was part of you know what he was wanting
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.920]   to do and he was finally able to you know make progress in that in his meditations and so on
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:23.920]   um so that was interesting but i'm not not too long ago on you know i run into him he's like um
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.680]   he's like you're not going to believe this he's like he was so excited but he's also into ozone
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:32.400]   therapy as well but um and anything into aging because he's like i want to say he's close to 80
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.320]   years old notes doesn't he something maybe 80 but he's like so much energy going to the gym and
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   doing all these things more energy than most people doesn't stop but so that the way you just
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.840]   coming the other day is like um i just went to the barber the other day same woman i've been
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.920]   going to that's been cutting in my hair for 10 years and he says like um he's like hey we say
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.200]   what are you what are you doing to your you know hair or what are you doing these days because
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:19:00.400]   it's similar your hair is coming in darker like he was all white all gray and he's like the same
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.160]   i i didn't tell this person anything she custom my hair for 20 years since you just mentioned
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.560]   that my hair is coming in darker and you can tell me his hair does look darker now too he's like
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:14.480]   something i'm doing is working you know he's been with the last six eight months he's been using
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:22.480]   the machine pretty regularly how much does he use the machine i want to know yeah i don't i don't
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:28.640]   i don't know exactly but um i would think i mean he didn't tell me but i would what he's told me
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:34.560]   before is uh it seems like he does it every day you know at least you know once a day it's part of
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.520]   his you know routine or ritual you know it's it's fairly easy i find it's one of the easiest um
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:48.800]   i guess supplements or health beneficial things you can do i i find just because it's so easy you're
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.000]   sitting at a desk you're laying down you're relaxing you're sitting down you know watching
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.720]   something on the tv or reading or laying down the rest just well again and you know put the
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:04.160]   can go on and flip on the machines for breathing it it's much easier than making up a smoothie even
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:11.280]   or yeah it's perfect when you've done nothing to wash a cleanup afterwards it's so easy to use so
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:17.440]   i i when i follow up with people i find people are really still using it because they do see a
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:23.600]   benefit and they use it every day because it's so simple and easy to keep up with it is definitely
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:30.160]   the lazy person's health remedy yeah exactly or i'm or desk jockey because i'm a desk jockey
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.680]   sitting at a computer up to ten hours a day longer sometimes and i'm plugged in most of the time
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:40.160]   you know uh into my gatting uh but yeah i just want to let you know i just want to stay on a sidebar
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:46.640]   for um for anyone who's listening to this video and is not aware that we that Ben has started a
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:54.720]   telegram chat group on on on uh browns gas also known as h h o we also discuss hydrogen uh oh three
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:01.200]   therapies and also structuring water because it's all related it's all about water and and gases
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:05.840]   and you know health gases so it's on telegram and you know i just want to point out that you know
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.400]   what you just said uh there's been folks that have jumped in because this thing i think our
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:16.320]   our chat groups been going on for around about a year maybe now or but you know um but i remember
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.240]   reading if we go through the history of the chat group there's a another gentleman came in
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:26.640]   and posted that his hair also he'd gotten a generator and his hair was also getting darker
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.440]   and he was an older gentleman so it's just not it's not a one-off claim when there's been at least
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:36.240]   two that i know of for sure of folks that are actually experiencing that and for me personally
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:43.760]   god i don't worry about it yet but it'd be interesting to see if i retain my dark hair as i get older
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:49.520]   but yeah that's really amazing uh but yeah it sounds creamy that on it though i get
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:57.600]   i get comments on my skin as well and um i was just with another client in in town recently and
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.560]   you know public place and someone that she hadn't seen in several years three or four years comes
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:06.960]   up though she's like hey how are you doing talking to my client i didn't know this person he's like
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.640]   the first thing he says like wow you look wonderful what are you doing you know and then we were just
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.400]   talking about you know the machine and how we've been using and all that and he comes up and
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.480]   say wow you look great how are you doing everything in three or four years and look better than ever
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:26.880]   and so we both look at each other and laugh but you know that was i mean another coincidence
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:34.720]   baby but um it's that it happens again and again those kind of stories yeah in fact uh right when
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:40.640]   you you stepped away for a second uh Mandy if you want to share um you know she was talking about
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:47.120]   her bagging experience um so i don't know if you wanted to share that i mean i've only done
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:53.120]   bagging when i had a burn um and to help heal the burn faster actually it took the pain away
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.560]   it didn't i noticed that when i bagged my burn i you know i burned my hand um the pain went away
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.720]   really quickly uh and i never heard again after that for like you know the whole time i was healing
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:09.200]   so i didn't i didn't yeah i didn't see you heal faster but the pain was gone and then and then
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:15.120]   Mandy yeah exactly talking about her that's been just as well yeah Mandy did you want to you know
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:24.960]   want to share your story about um about your skin and sure yes so um yeah the other night i um
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:34.000]   got a garbage bag and i basically bagged my whole leg um back when i was a teenager i had a skiing
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:46.160]   incident um and through the years i'm 50 now um with you know excess you know uh stress on my knee
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:54.160]   it would sometimes get swollen but then it would go away well lately um my knee has been kind of
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:24:01.840]   swollen for the last four years and i'm really stubborn i'm not going to go to mainstream medicine
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:08.800]   um and it really doesn't hurt it's just it looks terrible because it's you know swollen
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:15.840]   the only time it really hurts is if i've you know overextended or stood you know stood too long
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:24.800]   or worked too hard or whatever or if the dog runs into my leg um but you know it's it's tender
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:33.760]   but not really sore um but then also my foot i've got a worton storoma on that same my right leg
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:41.680]   my foot there and there was also a sore spot in the middle of my calf i don't see anything
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.160]   there it just was sore so i thought you know i'm gonna bag my whole leg
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:55.280]   and i did that for probably an hour hour and a half maybe and um first of all my well
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:04.560]   and i also have really uh dry cracked heels from i think thyroid issues um and my foot was just
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:11.760]   baby soft well my skin all my skin on my leg was just baby soft and felt so good the pain was gone
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:19.840]   um i was like wow okay i'm gonna have to do this more often this was really nice and um yeah so
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.640]   yeah you know like you get one of those bags like oh ben you were gonna
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:30.080]   start selling bags right but yeah the if for anyone who doesn't know it's basically you just
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.920]   literally take a bag that you would use for taking a shower if you had a cast right and you stick
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:41.040]   the hose in there and just fill it up keep away from it's almost really not worth selling because
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:46.080]   what i find what works best are the the bags the plastic clear bags you get in the produce
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:52.960]   section of your grocery store okay those are the right size you can see through them um you can
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:58.560]   see if any humidity and water is collected in there which is not a bad thing to me you know it's
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:03.360]   you know getting in there and condensing um and so you can see how close where the tube is where
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:08.240]   the end is but that's like that's the easiest way to back up your hand or your foot and something
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.640]   like that um the elbows and shoulders and knees are a little bit more difficult and actually um
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:20.800]   my my mother's a seamstress she she she sews as well and she's actually working on a prototype
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.520]   right now that i want to use for my shoulder which is basically a sleeve you know be gathered with
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:31.520]   elastic on both sides in a kind of um what in the waterproof cloth that you'll be able to slip
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:37.440]   onto your elbow your shoulder your knee and i'm going to be testing that shortly as well um i've
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:42.560]   tried it with bags you can make a hole in the bag i just mentioned so you can make it into a sleeve
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:48.080]   but that becomes more difficult because you got to close up two ends and it's kind of like it makes
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:53.840]   sounds and it's crinkly and it's not as convenient but on this new system we're working on i think
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:59.120]   it's going to be much better um i also found that um you know external issues are fine at you know
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:05.600]   i got a funnel i put on my shoulder to help it but if it's a larger area i mean i found the area i
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.240]   put it on it works great and really quickly but it doesn't give the whole joint all around the
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:18.400]   joint is what you really need to get a good result and um feedback so i so that's why
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.480]   we'll probably we'll work on it we'll probably sell that on our website and i'll make it available
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:27.280]   in as well yeah we're kind of joking around a little bit with Mandy this week because Mandy
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:32.960]   want to share the idea that you had and then and then when we heard it we're like no no but yeah
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:39.760]   go ahead share the idea because in case anyone's thinking this yeah don't do it it's like well
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.240]   that was probably the best thing is knowing oh good the universe does have my back all right
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:54.960]   um so yeah i've got decades of adrenal thyroid issues so there's just various pieces and parts
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:02.320]   of me that just need attention um you know from my hair the to you know my scalp to the tips of my
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:07.760]   toes and so i got the brilliant idea that oh i should just get a hazmat suit and pipe the gas in
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:15.840]   or you know something like that and then the conversation turned to um maybe a tent and so we
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:21.840]   looked up personal saunas and i was like oh yeah instead of a light or steam we could just pipe
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:29.200]   the gas into the tent great idea and i was like should i message the guys and see if this is a
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:35.520]   good idea and i was like no i think i'm just gonna do it and then post my results and about that time
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:41.840]   i popped onto the group and somebody else had kind of i forget exactly how they phrased it but it was
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.800]   something about you know is it possible to do a tent or something without blowing myself up and
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:54.400]   i was like who and so i followed the conversation and joined in and realized oh and i had already
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:01.680]   bought the tent mind you oh wow i had it right here i was mere moments away from piping gas into
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.960]   this thing and stepping inside translated moments away from blowing yourself up
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:14.880]   so ben you want to like you're the engineer here who builds browns gas generators you want to
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:21.440]   explain what you told us why that is not a good idea right it's just flammable and it's hard to
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:26.800]   control the percentage i mean it's in the lab in the super laboratory setting um you know with rats
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:32.000]   they do they have special devices to monitor the percentage of the hydrogen because over like
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.360]   4.7 percent really over 4 i'll be worried percent of hydrogen gas and air it becomes flammable so
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.000]   you don't want that to happen um along those lines i got a story to tell i just heard recently
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.840]   back from the client um he ran his he got his machine and was filling it up it ran fine and he
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:55.840]   was gonna he was putting additional water in it without the the top um you know expansive chamber
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:02.000]   on it and so the machine was turned off and it was just you know the top of the machine was the
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.760]   electrolyzer cell was you know open air so it was air it out for a while as well but you know i guess
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:12.240]   where he used his cold and walked around on the carpet with um socks you know you can create a
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:18.560]   charge so just the the act of touching the funnel the plastic funnel to the metal tip of the
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:25.440]   electrolyzer cell it made a spark and whatever residual hydrogen was in there it may even be
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:30.000]   the the electric really expanded water because you would think the hydrogen would escape pretty
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:37.840]   quickly but with um regardless i mean that little spark he said and he noted it that um trigger
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.000]   an explosion and just a really loud pop i mean it didn't hurt anything nothing break the machine
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.720]   was fine but it it's both scared them and it's like just a wake-up call so like you really got to be
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:55.120]   careful when you're dealing with it and so i mean we're you know updating our documents again to
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:02.080]   help you to be more careful and in in not even pouring what when once the machine has been turned
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:08.880]   off let it air out more maybe by the way to blow out any gas there's maybe Romanian in there and
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:14.560]   don't touch you know a funnel directed to the metal top maybe pour it only through the the top
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:19.600]   cylinder expansion chamber that's on the top to create a little bit more distance and give the
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:25.840]   yes it's time to diffuse but um that was pretty amazing here in that story bonus points to the
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.720]   universe for saving my butt it's winter here in northern Illinois and we get a lot of static
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:40.960]   electricity right so what would be so like obviously you don't want to tend to yourself like a sauna
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:47.600]   up to your neck and then create this giant gas bubble but so you're saying that hydrogen is flammable
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:55.200]   if it's more than four percent of the of the volume of the gas more than four percent is hydrogen then
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:01.600]   it becomes flammable and so the generators are designed so that they don't go up that high but
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.960]   then if you fill it but if you fill up a you know a space then it's going to get higher right but
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:13.120]   the generator's output is not flammable is that correct or or not right well the generator's output
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:20.400]   i mean is your you know hydrogen oxygen gas for the most part so um so that's how brown torches or
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:27.200]   or may brown gas torches are made at least available but the the coming out at the end
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:35.520]   it is you know super concentrated and flammable but the idea is to to find a or to get below that
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:43.040]   official four point seven percent hydrogen in the air mixture um when with what you're breathing
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:48.240]   i mean ideally you would calculate the volume of your lungs how many breaths you take per minute
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:54.240]   so how many liters of air you're breathing per minute and then you can adjust the volume of the
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:00.400]   gas from the machine using the control panel in those machines um so you can get below that
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:06.720]   ideally you know four percent i mean even that one in two percent you know we've get um you can
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:11.440]   feel it you know you can get a therapeutic dose you know two or three percent again so that's why
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.880]   you don't want to be so the idea you got a hundred percent right it comes out a hundred percent but
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:22.240]   what you breathe it as long as it's mixed with air it quickly i mean just like an inch from the
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.640]   the nozzle from even a torch if you were using a brown gas torch a ninja so from the nozzle it's
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:33.600]   no longer flammable because it's mixed and right okay yeah okay okay so you want to keep your lungs
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:41.280]   at a below flammable you know uh you know density of yeah so whatever is in your lungs you want to
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:49.040]   make sure you're getting air along with the browns gas right so that what's inside your lungs is a mix
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:55.920]   of air right is a mix of air and okay okay so then if you back as well you don't want to do a like a
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.920]   basic mask you never want to use a face mask masking hello yeah that's right because we had
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:04.960]   right because we had uh i know that we had somebody jump in once and said that they connected their
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:12.640]   browns gas generator to their CPAP and you were like totally bad right okay so and that's because
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:18.000]   right don't do that because in the face mask well but they're still breathing in and out though
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.520]   wouldn't when the mixture of air and browns gas still or is it you just what do you think it would
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:32.560]   accumulate the face mask the face mask um prevents normal air from mixing in as quickly as it would
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:38.480]   as if you use it compared to a cannula for example right cannula it just owes light up to you know so
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.280]   when you breathe in there's so little hydrogen but you're sucking in a majority of fresh air
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:49.600]   and see you long right so it quickly disperses it becomes inflatable okay so so without having to do
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:57.360]   a whole lot of math um what's the quick way to know what to have your settings on and how much
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:08.160]   you're getting what i what i've come to to um the conclusion of the easiest way um is really just
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:13.280]   and this is what i get this as a note in my talk too i was going to mention you know more is not
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:19.760]   better and less is more um nowadays i'm using the the machine on just 20 power
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:25.840]   um you go to a hundred percent in another client contact like contacted recently saying you know
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:31.920]   then um i'm starting to dry out you know my lungs are a little bit as my sinuses severe or you know
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:37.200]   or drying out like what's going on like what percentage power are using it on like 100 percent i'm like
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.840]   oh my god that's not a good idea like i don't know where you get that idea but you know what in
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:48.000]   everything we write and tell it's like no that's way too high for you know one person to breathe um so
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:56.960]   so the idea is to start low and um in in this if you can feel an attack then you're you're good
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:02.080]   because the body's accurate you know really quickly between you know and within 20 minutes
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:08.240]   you usually get a uh a small amount your hydrogen is um your body's actually worth a hydrogen so um
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:14.320]   20 40 percent at most if you just want to do it for a short period of time you know an individual
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:21.520]   but um really i mean 10 20 percent and actually the person they were just riding by um he knows
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:25.840]   the same things they've been i can still feel it you know the effects that 20 percent don't
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:32.400]   want to keep that there because you'll you'll save water the the um electrolyte cell will heat
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:38.880]   up less it'll throw out less water vapor your distilled water will last longer um the the gases
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:44.160]   coming out will be cooler it'll be much more pleasant to breathe and less likely that any um
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:49.760]   contaminants will be you know spit out as well from the same um and it's a lot less drying and
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:54.560]   much more pleasant at a lower percentage and you still get the same effect you know and a lot of
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.880]   things you think more is better in some cases that may be the case but in this case it's definitely
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:05.840]   not the case so people are what if you're doing like if you're just doing like bagging a limb or
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:10.960]   something do you want to have less is more or do you want to have kick it up a little bit
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:15.120]   yeah that's a good good question um that's all the different story um i would go as much as 80
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.880]   percent in those cases um because you're not you know it's not going into your sinus membranes
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:26.240]   and it won't be as drying and if it does throw out a little bit of extra water it's not a bad thing
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:34.000]   because um that'll keep you know your your tissues moist as well so um i still wouldn't do a hundred
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.360]   percent um if maybe i was for a short period of time as much as 80 externally like for half
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:46.240]   hour at most an hour but in my experience i mean if you want to do it long time for a few hours on
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:52.320]   a limb you know 40-50 percent power with our machine is probably you know just as fine
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:38:01.120]   so um my husband bought some pieces and parts um because we have like a three gallon uh carboy
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:07.280]   and we were thinking of running another tube and grommet and air stone and all that into that
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:12.400]   because i'm like trying to get enough water in the little drinking container for him to water all
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:19.920]   of his plants would take forever so we thought well if we get like you know run it into the the
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:25.840]   hose and everything into the lid of a three gallon carboy um can we still have
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:34.320]   like like the machine can can do that right i can have three yeah yeah that would be fine um and in
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.960]   those cases i mean you could just crank it up for plants and stuff like that in animals you could
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:43.360]   crank it up higher you know eighty nine hundred percent in um a large volume a few gallons of water
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:49.840]   um attached an air stone directly to a long hose and hook it up directly you know hook it up to the
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:56.480]   second bubbler or an eye machine you can hook a you know silicon or vinyl hose to directly to the
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:02.960]   second um bubbler there skip the whole um drinking container connect your air stone and put that
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:10.160]   into your water you want a bubbler i use your name or i use your name okay it would it be okay so
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:16.560]   if i've got he he bought one of the little um uh things that's got the the you've got the two
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:28.160]   um watch McCall's on there for the cannulas he bought one this yeah the three yeah the splitter
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:34.880]   he got one that's right boy could have um i could be breathing it if you go in yes that into the
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:41.920]   drinking water and then the third hose to go into his bottle what would i put the setting on if i'm
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:48.640]   breathing it going into the drinking water and going into the car boy right that that's a good
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:56.640]   question um if you're going to use the air splitter at all um it's really only good um i would don't
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.760]   use an air splitter i would only use it when you want two people to breathe at the same time for
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:07.760]   any other use case i would plug in directly to the second bubbler especially if you want to
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:14.080]   uh bubble a few gallons of water you want to do a lot more and you need a lot more pressure for
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:20.640]   that so you want to just do that to use a three-way air splitter to breathe bubble water uh it's just
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:28.320]   not going to work the just the pressure in the water will keep bubbles from going down coming up
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:35.440]   through the air stone if the other side of uh or if one of the um passageways of the hose with
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:40.560]   air splitter is open the air is going to take the path path of least resistance so it's too much
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.160]   it needs too much pressure to go down and bubble up through the air stone it's going to take the
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:50.320]   path of the path of least resistance and go out the the unobstructed flow of the the hose and the
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:58.400]   tube the kangula okay so like at all to a hundred percent the the carboy is still not going to get
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:04.240]   all that it needs and i'm going to get overdosed right yeah you're not breathing all day i would
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:09.680]   assume so it's you're better off just running it at you know ninety a hundred percent for half hour
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:16.080]   hour on the water you want to use for your plants or animal gotcha gotcha okay yeah because honestly
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:22.000]   it's just you just take this plastic drinking container and you replace it with your carboy
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.440]   so this with this tube right here with the stone would go into the bottom of the carboy full of
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:32.720]   water and then uh then coming off the top right here of the carboy right you just would you know
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:37.360]   drill two holes like it on the in the in the cork well you don't even do that i mean and then you
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:43.040]   can just do open yeah are you yeah you just breathe off the top the hose coming out of the second
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:47.680]   bubble or connect the hose connect to an airstone and just pop the airstone into whatever water you
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:53.040]   want to bubble it's good yeah you just have to be a sealed container oh okay well that's even
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:58.320]   easier than yeah i was thinking of right exactly as much easier yeah i was thinking to doing the
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:04.320]   same thing with getting um uh having the second bubble or go into a water bottle and then instead
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.400]   of you know because i don't have this thing uh and then have and then just breathing off the top
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.720]   of the bottle so that whenever i wanted to drink it hadn't been sitting for a while because you know
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:18.320]   if it sits for a while right that the gas diffuses so that way i'd get a full saturated water every
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:23.360]   time i drink because i'm breathing through my drinking water right and that would work i just
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:28.560]   got to figure out it the only reason the only reason and the best reason to use this drinking
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:34.000]   container that you see in a picture right here is so that um you can fill it with water bubble it
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.320]   through there forces the gas through the water comes out and then you know few people can breathe
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.400]   it if you're in a rush you don't have much time you've got water ready to drink and you've just
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:46.560]   done a session of phase 20 30 minutes and you've got water ready to drink right after you've
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:51.920]   breathed it so it's like a two for one you know but if you've got more time you're around the
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:57.280]   machine more often or home more often then it just is easier well to do one or the other you can
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.920]   remove this drinking container completely connect your canula if you're just one person to the second
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:07.680]   bubble or you know connect your air stone to that second bubbleer um we're just doing water for
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:15.520]   drinking even if you just want to drink water yeah because i'm like well the container is
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:20.000]   kind of small i was like i wonder if i could put it in like one of my gallon or half gallon
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:27.520]   glass jars that's the other thing is i was wanting to get it into a glass container that's larger
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:32.720]   quite exactly i i do the same thing same thing from the second bubbleer i run a stretch of tubing
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:38.720]   that's connected to air hose and just drop that into a amazing glass jar and that's how i usually
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:48.160]   do my water use an open lid on that or right yeah yeah yeah it's much easier and can be just
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.400]   even open lid i mean under pressure you get a little bit more hydrogen dissolved in there but
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:59.600]   it's really not worth the hassle when you get enough benefit i find just having an open container and
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:05.840]   plop in the air stone in there plus with glass you don't want to um have it pressurized anyways
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:11.600]   but especially with uh any i how you're doing you know free or exclusively in that open space in
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:18.080]   there the effects point in the glass what's so you never want to close glass container that's
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:23.360]   why that drinking container we do we do use this plastic in worst case if something happened that
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:29.920]   you know the top would pop off there right good point i mean some people don't like drinking
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:34.560]   from plastic so let's help them to do just connect second bubble to the air stone drop
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.520]   there stone in the glass jar of water open top and you can bubble there for you know 10 20 30 minutes
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:48.400]   out of you know you like okay as well so Ben you know the the conversation here is sort of focusing
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:54.160]   on testimonials um but no i'm really glad you covered this because we're talking about
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:45:00.320]   um two ways to use browns gas one is breathing and we've got a few of the important you know a few
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:04.400]   of the benefits of breathing but now let's talk about the water because you know thanks to Mandy
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:09.120]   she's brought it up so let's talk about what are the benefits or do you even see a different
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:15.120]   benefit from drinking water that had the gas bubbled in it right because there's two ways you
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:22.640]   can take gas in the in water that's bubbled or breathing so are these any testimonials okay
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:27.840]   we could pop over like what are the testimonials because you've got i guess this is your friend from
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:33.280]   Costa Rica right so he's like made some recordings and you've that you've mentioned which is like
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:38.480]   meditation sports recovery which is awesome stuff so on the website you can go and check out
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.560]   these testimonials and then so do you have any that are like people drinking the water and they're
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:47.680]   all of a sudden realizing that wow this water's more satiating or it's more hydrating or anything
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:54.960]   like that um definitely more hydrating um between being my family and people i talk to um you might
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:46:01.360]   my wife here as well it seems like if you are needing more water if you're already hydrated um
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:06.880]   and you do drink this water you're less likely to have to go to the bathroom soon afterwards um it
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:12.640]   seems like the water simulates better into your body and tissues and if you drink granular
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:18.400]   tap water spring water any other alternative water the water seems to stay inside you up to it
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:27.040]   until you've uh i guess refilled your reserves internally um so that's a common theme it this
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:33.360]   it seems to hydrate better um also me my wife is nursing right now too she produces more milk
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:37.760]   when you know for the baby when she drinks this water has compared to other water
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:45.520]   um in sports it does help you know hydrate yourself faster you know we're translate to
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:51.440]   just more energy more endurance um my friend brian he put those some audio testimonials on there
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:58.560]   he even he mentions that um something i noticed with drinking the water is that you know i'll drink
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:04.720]   before i go to bed sometimes and then also i'll breathe during the night but i i have noticed that
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:10.720]   when i drink the water before bed my sleep is deeper and when i breathe either before bed or
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:19.680]   and while sleeping um my dreams are more active so the the water um affects more your physical body
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:24.320]   which kind of makes sense it goes into your stomach and it may be spread from there um whereas
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:28.960]   breathing it and inhaling it affects more your mind and mental state which makes sense as well
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:34.480]   because it's going right after your nasal passage and it can pass the blood brain barrier really
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:40.720]   easily you know be being a hydrogen you know smallest molecule you know there is h2 um
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:48.080]   so those are both so you get very different benefits from both so we do definitely recommend
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:57.680]   drinking the water and breathing it um so i think i noticed something i'm not sure if this is related
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:06.720]   or not but my list of videos to watch is really really long since joining all these telegram groups
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:14.960]   so i thought okay i'm gonna watch them on you know a faster playback speed but i just i couldn't
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:20.000]   do it because i'm like i can't i can't make sense of what they're saying when i've got it going
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:28.320]   even just a little bit faster last night for the first time i was like i'm going to try it again
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:34.320]   i put this guy on two times speed and i listened to the whole video that way it made complete sense
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:41.680]   and i'm like i was also doing this gas at the time i was like i wonder if the gas is like making
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:47.600]   my cognitive functions like be able to pick things up quicker that's the speed we're
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:52.960]   interested in this fast yeah that that's super interesting you mentioned that because i've
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:58.640]   noticed the same thing um i've got no patience for a slow video or slow talking to you even
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:05.280]   so i always watch my informational videos on 2x sometimes i wish there was 3x but um as far as
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:10.720]   well one so along those lines affecting your your mental state i i do notice like it clears
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:17.760]   that mental fog you get sharper quicker um it just i mean especially for me one way to notice is
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:21.680]   what's going on in your mind is just the dreams too i mean because that as you're sleeping your
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.640]   dreams more active that tells you your mind's more active and it's getting in there and doing
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.280]   something in your brain that's a good thing it's just thing you're staying more active in there and
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:31.520]   your brain is processing things faster that's how to do what's happening but another interesting
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:36.720]   thing end of this you know myself recently is um i way back in you know high school college i used
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:43.120]   to play a lot more music and um a lot with the flute you know so flute i used to be you know good
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:48.480]   back then it was in the New Orleans Civic Symphony when i was there for a while you know for fun and
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:53.520]   um i i'd lug my flute along with me and every now and i'd pick it up but it's been it was like five
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:58.640]   or sixty years before or no more than that by ten you know i had such a favorite so like like five
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:03.920]   years i picked it up in my fingers we're not moving you know the same musical pieces that i played
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:08.320]   before it's like wait did i just lose everything you know what's wrong with my mind and my fingers my
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:14.400]   body's nothing nothing's moving and um i'm like oh it's kind of like disappointing and then um just
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:19.280]   a month or so ago moving things around i figured i'd just pull it out and just you know better play
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:26.080]   i played better than ever i'm like oh my god as like it was so obvious the difference to me
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:33.280]   um my my motor skills and mental coordination and reading the music and playing it was like as
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:38.480]   smooth as it was back when i was in high school college i'm like oh my god and the main difference
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:44.320]   has been um you know the the browns gas and the hydrogen the only thing i could um so you don't
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:50.640]   just improve overnight so cognitive re cognitive thinking and memory memory retention right
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:56.880]   that's pretty cool well exactly yeah back to the dreaming thing i know you had mentioned that like
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:03.200]   the first day i got it and we were in discussion he said um dreams will be next level and i'm like
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:11.760]   mine already are actually um pretty next level super detailed i remember that and i said yeah
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:16.240]   you told me your dreams were like already pretty incredible and i said well it will take
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:21.680]   it to another level possibly so what do you have to report that interesting thing is everyone's
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:30.800]   in a blue moon i would fly in my dreams um but like it was like maybe once every few years
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:36.320]   since i've had the browns gas machine i've flown three times i've only had the thing four weeks
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:43.040]   wow it's like once a week you're flying now yeah and i'm like okay that's cool because
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:49.120]   i love that i mean i feel so good i wake up from a sleep when i've been flying and man are your arms
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:58.240]   tired sorry that's an old joke i just had this but sometimes it's not um it's not always like
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:04.480]   superman style flying sometimes it's just like i rise up in the air and it's like skating i look
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:10.640]   like i'm just skating but it's like hovering above the earth sometimes it is actually flying
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:18.480]   but it's always just you know floating or being you know not bound to gravity
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:24.880]   basically that's odd man is really great right yeah you know i've got two more interesting
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:29.600]   mental well one more interesting mental thing to report kind of related to that as well um that
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:34.240]   had happened to me recently until i started you know inhaling more especially inhaling overnight
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:39.920]   um well then in talking with other friends we agree that this is really a spiritual tool you know
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.080]   if you want to take it to that it's got a whole healing physical healing part of it right but
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:49.440]   there's also the mental and spiritual aspect of it where it allows you to access new and other
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:56.080]   mental and spiritual state and in the spiritual i guess realm and community they say if you can
[00:52:56.080 --> 00:53:02.880]   control your dreams and lucid dream you're that much more able to pass or make the transition
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:08.480]   if and when you do die right so that's part of like i think some people say our spiritual evolution
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:13.760]   so in a way i mean i've come me talking to others in the community where we've come to the
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:19.200]   conclusion that hey this maybe is a spiritual tool and can be used in those ways but um my specific
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:26.000]   experience i wanted to report on and tell you guys about is um i was having uh uh twice this
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.640]   happens to me i have a super detailed dream um lucid dream i know what's going on i'm looking
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:35.200]   around and exploring because it's so detailed i'm like wow this is a dream this is so interesting
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:38.720]   i'm just walking around exploring things looking at the details and all the interest
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:44.080]   disease of everything it was incredible and then something happened and um i woke up and i was
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:49.440]   back in my bed sleeping and um there's something like a number of times it's like i wanted to go
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:53.440]   back into the dream but i was back in my conscious body but i didn't i felt i didn't finish that dream
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:59.520]   so um but i was you know i was breathing the gas at the same time but mentally i was able to
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:05.200]   transition from being awake and without losing consciousness go right back into the dream where
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:11.840]   i was you know and focused in my mind was that activated in awake i think because of the gas
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:17.040]   you know the the hydrogen probably right that you know goes right into your mind but um you know
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:24.240]   on another occasion too i was able to transition from being awake in conscious in my body and go
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:31.040]   directly into a dream world uh without losing consciousness because what i always thought was
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:38.640]   like uh strange or um you know i always wonder what happens in between that where does your conscious
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.640]   go in between that state of like okay waking and then you all of a sudden you're dreaming what happens
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:47.840]   in that transition state i mean twice i was able to bridge that gap and bridge bring my consciousness
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:53.600]   with me you know and focusing on that and i was never able to do that before that's very cool yeah
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:58.000]   hey we're at the top of the hour so i'm trying i would like to as your moderator want to kind of
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:04.160]   keep these two as close to an hour as possible um and we're planning on doing uh this once a month
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:09.280]   as as we get more and more testimonials and experience so that people can learn from others so
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:13.440]   uh this won't be the last one but i do want to kind of uh touch on a couple of things
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:18.640]   um so we've got uh be Palmer's joint so i don't know if you had any questions or you wanted to
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:23.920]   share your testimonial i know emo you're on as well haven't heard about any testimonials if you want
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:30.160]   to uh chime in uh now it'd be great uh and then you just you can either do through unmuting your
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:37.040]   microphone jump in or just ask a question in the chat uh or on telegram i'm watching that
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:41.280]   and then while you're considering that i do you know it's looking at your page while you're talking
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:48.560]   Ben and you see this this this i think you know this is probably so pertinent uh you know in in
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:55.200]   where we're living right now right in this pandemic but here's this you know this is amazing here is
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:01.920]   a um testimonial from one of your customers it talks about feeling sick using the browns gas and
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:08.320]   boom felt great the next day are you getting those kinds of i mean is this like a fluke or is this
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:15.040]   like these are you're getting these kinds of uh testimonials about the possibility of browns gas
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:20.880]   being a healing gas to you know for when you're sick because so far we've talked about injuries
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:24.720]   right but we haven't talked about illness so what what are your thoughts there and
[00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:32.880]   what's your experience with browns gas and illnesses yeah it's it's another common theme on anything
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:40.560]   respiratory lungs and sinuses um especially colds or flues that kind of thing it goes away quickly
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:45.360]   but the the other thing is if you're consistently using it i used to get three or four colds a year
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:53.280]   i haven't got a cold or sniffle or any respiratory issue since i started using it um and new people
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.920]   to it that are either sick or they feel something coming on they they plug into the machine just
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:57:03.520]   like this testimony says this is like a common theme that they wow you know i felt a little something
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:10.560]   i plug in and next day i'm fine yeah that's pretty amazing so yeah if you know if you don't mind we're
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:14.560]   at the top of the hour but i'd like to share a testimonial for myself or something that happened
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:21.360]   last week um you know we all every now and then we all get food poisoning and and so my typical
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:27.520]   experience when i get food poisoning and we've all had it right it's massive amounts of pain
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:33.040]   unable to hold anything down and it usually for me it's always it always ends up lasting about
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:38.320]   three days the third day is when i finally start holding solids down and you know if life starts
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:45.040]   getting better but it's a three-day horrible ordeal and this last time uh last last week
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:51.120]   i basically ate um bad chicken on a sunday night that was what i thought it would happen to me
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:56.800]   and i i'd lost a day of work on monday i was literally in bed the whole day but what i was doing
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:00.320]   though that i i just i realized that you know i'm gonna you know because this is the first time
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:04.480]   it's happened to me since i had a bronze gas generator so i decided well you know i can't hold
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:09.760]   anything down right i just i barely drink water uh and so i figured well you know what i'm just gonna
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:16.480]   i can but i can still breathe thank god i was thinking you know i was thinking you could do
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:19.840]   yeah i was thinking to myself you know because you know you normally you would just i try to take
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:24.480]   some activated charcoal right but i couldn't hold it down so i was thinking well i can still breathe
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:29.200]   so why don't i just hook up and i just stayed hooked up though you know like literally the whole
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:37.440]   first day um and it was amazing because the literally i was in bed all monday you know i just i couldn't
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:43.600]   work in nothing and then on tuesday morning i started i made some or you know uh i mean so or i asked
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:49.040]   right or or a rehydration solution for myself and i started just sipping it you know and i i could
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:53.200]   hold it down i was like wow and i kept breathing it kept breathing it kept you know inhaling and
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:58.640]   then by tuesday at lunch i tried a banana you know and and i could hold it down and and what was really
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:04.960]   amazing is by tuesday night i had a full dinner i was sore from you know from being in pain but i
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:11.120]   wasn't sick anymore and literally by tuesday night i had a dinner and then by wednesday i was perfectly
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:18.000]   fine and that that has never you know and i'm like in my later 50s i never have i ever had an
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.840]   experience like that and it was just and the only thing i had done different was i was just
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:28.960]   sucking in as much brown as i could inhale and you know and it was the only thing i could use
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:34.560]   that was what really led me to it right because i you know i the only thing i was working in my body
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:39.920]   was my lungs so uh that's my testimony old that's a good point you know a good point because a lot
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:43.600]   of people that's the only thing they can do they're you know can't drink can't hold anything down
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:47.440]   it's like you can't do anything for me you just got to like deal with it until we can get something
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:51.360]   down and so you can hold something down but breathing yeah wow what a great belief in your
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:56.320]   sinner you're sitting there praying to god that you don't get so dehydrated to get an IV that's
[00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:01.600]   my biggest fear right yeah you go to the hospital you know and i just really i just and but it's
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:06.160]   happened where i've gotten so bad where i had to go because i was dehydrated but yeah that was my
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:12.240]   biggest fear but yeah i was like this thing hydrates you just by breathing and then at the same time
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:17.040]   though it did something that it was just amazing which leads to this other thing about you know i
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:23.200]   right here which is uh your one testimonial about somebody using it uh for you know when they feel
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.680]   sick so you know we're living in a pandemic right now and i'm just thinking wow this is this is an
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:33.760]   amazing uh reaction that my body had to the gas when i was being attacked by some nasty bacteria
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:38.640]   right or some some virus stomach virus so i'm thinking that and i just also want to do add that
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:44.560]   you know i've actually seen some of the literature coming out of china where the chinese are using
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:50.080]   browns gas uh is a treatment for people having lung problems instead of putting them on ventilators
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:55.040]   they're putting them on browns gas and one study that i read uh they had 50 patients that had that
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:02.000]   had the covid and they and what they did is i put them all on browns gas instead of the ventilators
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.600]   all 50 lived and i think the average uh uh reduction in hospital stay was three to five days
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:14.640]   and they that they were in the hospital less than the other patients who did it so not only did they
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:19.360]   all live they all got out of the hospital faster and that was pretty amazing so you know there's
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:26.400]   something about browns gas and viruses that i think should be looked into yeah exactly the study i
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.880]   read um say most recover within two or three days you know some one two but all of them within three
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:37.280]   days to recover yeah it's pretty amazing stuff so um okay so we're at we're at the we're at the one
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:44.640]   hour mark and i just want to say this was a great first browns gas webinar um i don't see any other
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:50.880]   questions in the chat so um uh i'll tell you what let's um uh we want to wrap it up Ben is there
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:56.480]   anything you want to share and then how can people find you um yeah there was there was a lot more
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.160]   testimonies i didn't get to get to which is a good thing so they'll just we'll have to do this
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:05.440]   again next month yeah it's amazing we got this actually good bit but we were able to get a lot of
[01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.800]   really important i think good information out there especially some of the the safety
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:14.480]   issues and so on but it was a lot of i think we got really good call and a lot of you know
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:20.080]   type of good information but um yeah we may want to do it again um again yeah i would definitely
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:25.840]   like to hear more about different ways to use browns gas you know we just really kind of just
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.400]   touched on it today it's amazing how fast an hour goes by jeez uh you know what we talked about
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:36.560]   using it uh uh topically by bagging we talked about drinking uh talked about pain relief talked
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:42.400]   about sports recovery and talked about uh how you can use it against a bacterial or viral infection
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:49.920]   so pretty cool stuff so um so maybe next time we can go into um like uh how are we going to do
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:57.680]   the ozone deflation yeah ozone and supplication i mean as anyone tried browns gas and supplication
