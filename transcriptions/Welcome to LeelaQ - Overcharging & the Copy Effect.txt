[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another takers Academy video. I'm your host K Almer and this
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.560]   video is another installment in the video series. Welcome to Layla Q, otherwise known as Layla
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.720]   Quantum Tech and quantum upgrade. It is a video FAQ series to answer questions that pop up regularly
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.960]   in our telegram chat groups. And this video is to discuss overcharging and the copy effect. Now,
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.720]   if you've been in any one of our telegram chat groups long enough, you're going to hear that
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.200]   word overcharging. And so I kind of wanted to kind of have this video to kind of explain what it is
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.480]   and what you should be concerned about if anything at all. All right, so let's jump right in. Now,
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.360]   the first thing is, is what is overcharging? Well, it doesn't happen with quantum upgrade. It
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.200]   just cannot happen with quantum upgrades. So nothing to worry about that. But if you have a block,
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.680]   okay, then if you were to take something and put it in a block, and this only applies,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.720]   now it does not apply to the quantum block. This only applies to the travel block,
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.040]   the infinity block, the grand block, and there's going to be a new block coming out in January 2025.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.760]   Not sure what the name is yet. We're kind of just giving it a nickname super grand block. But
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.360]   the idea here is that if you've got anything other than a quantum block, and you put it in that block
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.960]   for longer than the charging timeframes in the quick reference guide, which is also a guide that
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.760]   comes with the block when you get it. It's part of the marketing materials. And it's also on the
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.320]   website at LaylaQ.com. But there's these timeframes that have been established for when, you know,
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.160]   for how long it takes to charge an item with quantum energy. And so now if you go over that
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.880]   time, then that's simply called overcharging. Okay, so it's as simple as that. And the reason that
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.720]   there are timing guidelines is because the people at LaylaQ did all of this testing to figure out,
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.080]   you know, what was the ideal timeframes for different things. And so if you go over it, then, you know,
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.200]   there's a situation that occurs called overcharging. And it's something that, you know, you should or,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.000]   you know, maybe it doesn't apply to you. Maybe it does. It's not a bad thing, but that's what
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.720]   that means. Okay. So it's simply if you put something, and that's even if you got something
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.480]   from LaylaQ, you bought a capsule from them. And if you put it in a block, that's, you know, I'll
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.600]   get, well, get in that in a second, and you charge it for longer than the timeframes in the guide,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.520]   then it's going to become overcharged. And that's what that means. All right.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.280]   Now there are two factors that cause overcharging. The first one you should be aware of is that when
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.560]   you put anything in one of those stronger blocks, it's a cumulative. So it's based on time. So if I
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.600]   were to just take, let's say I got a brand new Layla card, and I wanted to make a copy of it,
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.480]   right? So I put it in the block, one of those three, right? And I put something else in there,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.680]   whether it's like jewelry, or I'm making foils, or whatever I'm making, right? Water, whatever.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:04.400]   But I put this new card in that block, and I exceed the timeframe that's in the reference guide for
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.840]   how long it should be in there for that purpose. And let's say I leave it in there for 30 minutes.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.560]   Okay. This is just purely illustrative purposes only. Okay. Now all of a sudden,
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.560]   you've got how it came out of the factory plus 30 minutes. It's well over the guideline,
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.560]   and now it's considered overcharged by definition. And that is one way to overcharge it by simply
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.160]   leaving it in too long in one of those blocks. And then what happens now is if you take a regular
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.120]   card that comes right out of Layla Q, it's got a field of about, you know, eight centimeters or
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.920]   four inches, right? That's the radius of the field. And then in which the energy permeates
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.840]   into it, like this little energy bubble, okay, around it. And if you're in that bubble,
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.680]   you're getting the frequency, et cetera. Now, if you leave it in there for longer than the charged
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.880]   time that's in the reference guide, it's going to have, it's going to be a cumulative energy. It's
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.160]   going to actually take on more energy than it, than it, you know, it came with, right? Because
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:09.120]   you just put it in a block. And then that larger, that I mean, larger amount of energy creates a larger
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.720]   field. And it becomes stronger. Now, there's no math on that. There's no, you know, table
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.920]   anywhere that anyone's just, you know, created that says how long, you know, and what it equals,
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.880]   okay? So that doesn't even exist yet. I mean, there's a million different scenarios you can
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.800]   imagine. And Layla Q just never has the bandwidth to kind of figure all that out. So these are just
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.600]   your general recommended guidelines. But what happens though, if you leave it in there for a
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.720]   long time, it's a cumulative. If you put it in there multiple times and your total accumulated
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.600]   time frame is 30 minutes, it's going to be overcharged. And it's going to be like a 30 minute card,
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.000]   right? You know, if you want to call it something, but it's definitely going to have a much stronger
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.200]   and larger field than it normally would have, you know, as a normal card, if you would just
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:03.040]   stuck to the charging time frames. So now, what happens when you take something that's overcharged
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.960]   and you put it next to something that's not overcharged, okay, then what happens is there's something
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.400]   called the copy effect. And that copy effect is now if those two fields merge like in this diagram
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.160]   right here, then if that thing has a frequency on it, then that frequency is going to copy to the
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.240]   lesser strength object. Okay, so you've got a stronger object and a lesser strength object.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.920]   And if you put them too close to each other and their fields overlap, then the frequency of the
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:38.000]   stronger object will copy to the weaker object. And that's just called the copy effect. And that's
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.480]   one of the drawbacks if you're working on trying to build up a frequency library, or if you have a
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.880]   bunch of cards and you don't want them to get mixed up and that sort of thing. So, okay, I'm just
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.280]   going to put a pin in that for right now and talk about the other thing, which I did mention,
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:58.480]   which is the other factor that can cause overcharging is if you just put it in a block that's stronger
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.320]   than the block that created it. Now, in today's world, it's 2024, all of the products that come
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.960]   from Leila Quantum Tech are charged in a 2200 block. So if you get a capsule or a card or a coaster
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.840]   or a hat or anything, it's all comes through a 2200 block. And if you put that in a block and the
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:25.920]   only one that's stronger than that right now is the brand new 2024 infinity block. That's at 3,800.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:32.480]   There's also, if you had an infinity block and you'd boosted it, that's at 27. So those two blocks
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.920]   right now are stronger than the product that, you know, than the one used to make the product. So,
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.840]   if you were to take, let's say an older capsule and you put it in a new infinity block, okay,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.760]   then immediately after the amount of time that it's been in there for the charging time frame,
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.800]   it's going to be overcharged with like one minute will overcharge it, right, just over the guideline,
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   okay. And that's how you can also create another overcharged item is not just leaving it in there
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.080]   for a longer period of time, but literally putting in a way stronger block. And then that stronger
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.280]   blocks going to, you know, basically add a lot more energy in layman's terms. And so the same
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.640]   thing's going to happen. The second object is going to be stronger. And so now if you took two,
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.480]   you know, heel capsules from, you know, a year ago, you put one in a, in a, let's say, an infinity
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.440]   block, you know, like a new one, then all of a sudden you've got one heel capsule that's going to be
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:33.680]   super strong, stronger than the first, the other one. And if those two things come near each other,
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.760]   like this diagram again, if their fields collide, you know, merge, right, and they start having them,
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.840]   then once those fields overlap, then the stronger quantum or that, you know, in the example, right,
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:52.320]   the stronger frequency in the stronger object, right, it has a stronger frequency will then copy
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.720]   over to the other capsule. And you may or may or may not want that. Most people don't want that.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.560]   They want to keep everything kind of separate. You don't want your, you know, heel, you know,
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.240]   360 to override your woman's booster kind of thing, right? In other words, you know,
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.280]   you don't want to create like this soup of frequencies in the, in the lesser strength object.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.000]   In other words, you know, my preference is I keep everything really clean and separate so that I
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.160]   know that, you know, my men's booster is just the men's booster. My heel is just the heel, right?
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.040]   I've never made sure that I ever did this because I want to keep everything clean. And, you know,
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.200]   and everything that's, you know, just keep all the frequencies separated like that. But that's
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.760]   how it happens. Okay. So that's what overcharging is. And that's how it happens. And so let's talk
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.560]   about, but you know, are there downsides? Because like I said earlier, there's, it's not a bad thing.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.480]   You know, it's just not, I mean, nothing bad's going to happen. But the idea here is that there
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.560]   are downsides. Okay. So one of the first things I really want to tell everybody is that if you've
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.520]   got surgical implants and metal fillings in your teeth, that's metal metal will overcharge. By the
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.720]   way, that's the only thing that can get overcharge is metal. And so now if metal gets overcharged,
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.920]   then what's the downside of that? Well, first of all, never put a frequency in your body. In
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:08.160]   other words, never put yourself in a block with a frequency. Okay, because that's going to put that
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.960]   frequency in that metal. And you may not want that frequency, you know, down the road. All right.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.040]   But the other thing though, it's going to overcharge you if you go over the charging time,
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.560]   which is perfectly not harmful. I have done it myself. I have spent countless hours
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.920]   with my own personal body, a head or foot, leg, whatever I'm, you know, working on,
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.040]   you know, in my grand block or in my infinity block, you know, so I've been charging myself
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:39.440]   for years and I am way overcharged. Do I have any metal in my body? Yes, I've got a gold crown
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:45.840]   in my mouth. And that crown is probably, I don't know, hours and hours and hours of being overcharged
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:52.000]   and from stronger blocks, right? So, you know, so is that an issue? Is there a downside to that and
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.400]   in prankling? No, because I'm not I'm not sensitive to it. I've been around this energy and in a
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.360]   really high level for so long that I'm just not sensitive to it. But if you've been on our
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:09.360]   telegram chat groups, you know that people who are new to this often have some kind of reaction
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.480]   to it because it's going to kick off biological processes. And that's a whole nother, you know,
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.360]   whole nother, I should make a video on what those are. But if you go and look at the studies,
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.720]   you know that it increases ATP, it, it expedites wound healing, it generates white blood cells,
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.640]   I mean, you know, you know, all this stuff, right? So it does stuff, you're actually
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:34.160]   physically having a physical reaction to the quantum energy. And if you're not used to that,
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.880]   then you kind of have some people have detoxism. So here's the thing, right? So that's why like,
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.360]   you don't want to overcharge the metal in you if you're simply sensitive to it,
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.600]   because it may affect your sleep and you can't take it out, right? I mean, you're not going to,
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.560]   you know, pull out your implant or anything. So that's one of the big things about overcharging
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.600]   that you really want to be conscious of is if you're sensitive to it, and you're charging
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.560]   yourself and the metal in you gets overcharged, then, you know, it can have some downstream effects
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:08.560]   that you may not want. And so that's one of the big cautions about overcharging that is a downside,
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.400]   you know, is, is, you know, being real careful about charging your body if you have metal implants
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.760]   and fillings. Okay, the other thing, then this is the big one for every, for all of you guys out
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:25.120]   there and myself included, who wants to, you know, you want to have a frequency library so that you
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.840]   can interchange different frequencies when you're using the blocks. Again, this doesn't apply to
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.520]   quantum upgrade. But if you've got like multiple cards, I have probably 200 at this point,
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.160]   I've got a huge collection of the Layla ones and a huge collection of ones I made myself.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:46.640]   And so if you've got all of these different cards, and they all have different frequencies on them,
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:51.600]   you certainly don't want to create a frequency soup by putting a super strong one in there,
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.400]   right, that's not equal to the other ones. And having that whatever's on that stronger one,
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.280]   copy over to the weaker one or have a bunch of strong ones and a bunch of weak ones and all of
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.680]   a sudden all your weak ones have got all these extra frequencies in there and you've created this
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:13.440]   soup. Okay, so you really want to be careful about creating this frequency soup, right,
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:19.760]   if you have a frequency library and you want to keep things organized and you want to keep things
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:25.520]   as they are, you know, you spend a lot of money on that abundance card or that emf card or whatever
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.600]   you bought and you don't want it to have take on all these other frequencies because you just
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.000]   want to use it for that purpose, right, at the time you want to, you don't want to mix and match
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.640]   these things. So that's the other downside, right, so just real heads up on the downsides.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.400]   Again, nothing the world's not going to end because any of this happens. Okay, but the idea though,
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.600]   is that if you want to just kind of, you know, keep with the program and use these tools effectively,
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.080]   this is what you need to know. So now when it comes to frequency soup, this is how you would
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.640]   avoid it. And it's really simple and this purely comes with if you've bought a bunch of different
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.200]   devices or cards and they all have different frequencies on it and you don't want to mix them
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:08.640]   up or you created your own library and you don't want to mix it up, right, then the easiest thing,
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:14.640]   and I know this is not practical for a lot of people, but just to have a quantum block. Okay,
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.920]   if you want to create a frequency library and you're serious about it, I would just, right off
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.880]   the bat, just go get a quantum block. And then you create all of your frequencies in your quantum
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:31.520]   block, right, so that you have one set of frequencies that you create, that's all even because they're
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:37.200]   all quantum block and quantum blocks cannot overcharge anything. So you're 100% safe
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:43.280]   with creating your own frequency library with a quantum block. And then if you remember now,
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:49.440]   if quantum blocks are only like 527 on the scale, right, but if you buy any of the Leila cards,
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.800]   remember they came out of a 2200 block, they're stronger than your own, you know, your own library
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:14:01.360]   that you created using a quantum block. So if you buy Leila cards, then what I do is I keep them
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:07.840]   in a purple pouch, you know, at a distance of at least three feet away from my collection. Okay,
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.200]   so I keep them separated. Okay, because the Leila cards from the Leila queue are stronger than
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.720]   the ones I make in the quantum. But if I'm building a quantum library, then just using a quantum block
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.760]   is the easiest way to go about it. Now, a lot of you guys just jumped right in and bought the
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.360]   infinity or you bought a travel or a grand perfectly fine. This is how you would do it. This is my
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.880]   recommendation is that when you first get your Leila card from Leila and you want to just keep
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:41.360]   your master's safe, right? What I mean by that is you bought the card, it's now the master copy of
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:47.200]   that frequency, right? Or you made a frequency card with, you know, like you're in one of those
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:51.280]   contests that they had, or you're just, you know, you're just tinkering around and you're making
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.400]   frequency cards using your infinity block. Okay, so if you follow the charging, you know,
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.280]   the copy charging guidelines, then you will have all of those cards that you made with your,
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.800]   let's say your infinity block will all be the same level. Okay, perfect, perfect, right?
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.640]   But they're going to be different than the one that comes from Leila queue. See what I'm saying?
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:16.080]   Because if you're using your infinity block, it's either going to be like a 972, which is the older
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:22.400]   ones, or it's going to be a 2700 or 3800. So it's going to be different than the 2200 that came from
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:28.880]   Leila. So this is why it's really important to keep your master copy safe, because a, they cost a
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.680]   lot of money and you don't want to mix them up, right? You don't want to create a soup out of them.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:39.200]   So what I recommend you do is as soon as you get one of those Leila cards, all right,
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:46.320]   follow the copy guideline timeframes and put it in the block, because, you know, if you want,
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:51.360]   because you're planning on using it, right? And then put in a big piece of foil, like a big one,
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:56.560]   like, you know, two feet long piece of aluminum foil and just stick it in there with the block
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:02.400]   and that card stick to the guideline time frame, take the card out. You're perfectly safe because
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:08.080]   you're within the time frame. You did not overcharge the card and then take that card and go and tuck
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.960]   it away and in its purple bag nice and safe so nothing ever happens to it again. So then what
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:18.480]   are you left with? You're left with this giant piece of foil that's got the frequency on it.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:24.720]   And so every time you want to use it, you just cut off a little square, right? Let's say I want to
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:30.400]   put it, you know, in the block with a picture. Well, every time I want to use that frequency,
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.840]   I cut a little square off of that big piece of foil and I put that little square in the block
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.880]   and let's say I want to treat a, you know, I got a dog right now in one of my infinity blocks. So
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.800]   I've got this giant, well, I don't know, and this is what I would do. So I have a giant piece of
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:51.600]   foil with heel for dogs on it, right? And I treat dogs all the time. Somehow I'm people are just
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:58.160]   gravitated towards me about dogs. And so, and so I would just take a little, cut a little piece of,
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.680]   you know, one inch square off of that giant piece of foil, right? Put that in the infinity
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.560]   block with the dog's picture, leave it in there for hours, days, weeks, whatever, you know,
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:14.240]   however long my intuition tells me to, you know, send that frequency to the dog using my infinity
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.320]   block. Well, if I did that, right, think about if I put that piece of foil in there for three or
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:23.680]   four days, you can imagine how much overcharge it's going to get. So now what happens with that little
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.000]   overcharge piece of foil when I'm done treating the dog? Well, you certainly don't want to put it
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.320]   near anything else you're ready on for everything I just described. Okay, now you've got a piece of
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.840]   foil that's overcharged, and you do not want it to just go anywhere near your library. Okay,
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.240]   because you don't want to create that frequency soup. So what I do, I just throw it away, you know,
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:48.720]   it's like just throw it away. And in that way, I never take the risk of having anything copy over,
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.360]   okay, you don't have to save the foils when you're done, just throw them away. And then the next
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.600]   time you need to use that frequency, cut another piece off. And that's the easiest way to deal
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.120]   with it. Now, if you're someone that's like, I don't want to keep track of my freedom, I want
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:08.240]   to reuse these foils. Then you know what, then basically you need to keep them apart from each
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.800]   other. So if you're going to store overcharged objects, which is, you know, like I just said,
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.360]   that's how I avoid it. I don't have overcharged objects in my house. I throw them away. These
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:22.560]   little pieces of foils that I use. But the thing about if you have overcharged objects, right,
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.280]   let's say you've accidentally overcharged a bunch of your stuff. Okay, so if you happen to overcharge
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.240]   your stuff or some of your library, and you don't want it to copy over to anything, then what you
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.760]   simply do is keep them separate. The recommendations from Layla is if you've got an overcharged item,
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:43.200]   if it's a card, you know, cards are not like the weakest object that they sell. And, you know,
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.680]   like, again, it's like a four inch field. It's not that big. That's radius by the way. Then you
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.120]   just keep it six inches apart. So you would if you had like all these little foils that you've
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.920]   been put in your blog, treating different people and animals, no problem. If you don't want to
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:01.040]   throw it away, just keep it six inches apart. And it's going to get kind of clumsy. It's going
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.200]   to get difficult to do that if you have a whole lot of foils. But that's one way to do it. Just
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:10.560]   keep them separate six inches apart. If you got something that's heavier, more metal equals stronger
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.680]   energy, then you keep it away at 36 inches. That's actually the recommendation minimum
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.360]   of keeping the blocks separate. You know, they don't want to have two blocks next to each other.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:23.760]   So you just keep a 36 inches three feet apart. So they don't mess with each other. And you don't
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.560]   have any issues with copy effect. Okay. So that's kind of what I would do to avoid the frequency
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.640]   soup. And again, I just want to say that, you know, overcharging is not a bad thing. It just
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.720]   is what it is. I mean, it's just, you're just creating more energy in a particular object.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.240]   And if you want, you know, and you could actually be doing that on purpose and for a very, you know,
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.400]   for whatever reason you want. However, you know, again, you know, there are two downsides. And
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.440]   that's why this video exists. So anyway, that's what overcharging is. That's how to avoid it.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.640]   That's what the copy effect is and how to avoid that. So thank you very much for watching the video.
