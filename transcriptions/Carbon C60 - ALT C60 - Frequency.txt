[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Carbon Sixty video by me, Kay Elmer, and in this video,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   it's part three of my Alt C60 series and this one is on frequency. Yes.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Can you take C60 by frequency? Well, let's find out before I get into it.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Disclaimers. This material is for research purposes only.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   C60 products are not approved for consumption by the FDA.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   You understand that consuming C60 is experimental and you do so at your own risk.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   I do not have a stake in a C60 product or company nor do I get paid in any way for making videos.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   The products mentioned in this video are not an endorsement. I'm not selling anything.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   So this is just my research. All right. Level set on that. Okay, let's move on.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Okay, so now as you all know, the mainstay, the way that everybody that does or takes C60
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   is they do so mixed in an oil. It originally started out with just olive oil and now
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   there must be a dozen or more different oils that people are blending C60 with
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   and selling commercially. And when you do mix C60 with oil,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   it's the scientific term for that is lipo-foolering and that's kind of the mainstay.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   That's the way ever since it kind of took off as a supplement how everybody takes C60.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   But since then, and that then was like 2013, 2012 around there,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   there's been alternative ways for people to take C60.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And so one of those ways is topically and I've done, there's different videos on all of these guys.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I did three videos just on topical. One was a product review, links in the video description below.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And so, you know, if you wanted to take C60, you don't necessarily have to just take it, you know,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   drinking it in oil. You can put it on your skin and it has a wonderful benefit to your skin
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   because of its antioxidant properties. Another way which I just recently released was the C60
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   through an atomizer in which you would just like kind of like an essential oil.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   But you put C60 oil in an atomizer, it atomizes it, you breathe it in and you can get that C60
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   deep into your lungs and for people who have congestion issues and lung issues,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   it's been found to be quite helpful. And so there's another way.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   You can breathe it in, you can put it on your skin, of course, lipofolourine.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   But this video, this is by far the most controversial and interesting way to take C60
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   that has been popped up on the radar in terms of commercial products.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   So this video will be talking about the different products that are out there
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   and the concepts behind frequency, like what does it mean to have C60 frequency
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   and how would you even do that? Well, stick around, that's what I'm going to talk about.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   So first thing I really want to say is I just want to quote Nikola Tesla
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   because if you understand energy and frequency, you're going to, yeah, you know,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   there's a lot more there than any of us were taught in school.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So just know that if you want to find the secrets of the universe,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration, Nikola Tesla.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   All right, now I just wanted to share that. Okay, so let's talk about molecular frequency.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Now you hard science guys and you know that you don't get into the whole woo-woo,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   you know, crystals and you know, drum circles and all that, I get it, I totally get that.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   But you do know, right, that it is a hard science and there's deep, deep, deep
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   science in quantum mechanics in terms of calculating the vibrational spectroph,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   well spectroscopy of different molecules and it's called a molecular frequency.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   So if you were just like Google molecular frequency or for those of you who are new to it
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   or go on YouTube, you will find lots and lots and lots of different videos
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   and different papers where scientists in the quantum mechanics field
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   have been attempting to calculate the frequencies of molecules.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   And then what that means is, and you know, to Nikola Tesla's quote,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   energy, vibration and frequency, well here's an animation of the C60 molecule
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   with another molecule trapped inside of it.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   But the whole idea, and this is just an animation to kind of just show you that,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   you know, if you understand how atoms are comprised of protons, neutrons,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   surrounded by electrons, everything is moving, everything is vibrating,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   everything has a frequency, everything is moving all of the time.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   From the smallest particle in existence to the largest particle in existence,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   you know, out there in the galaxy, everything moves because its atoms move.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And so as those atoms move in conjunction together as a molecule,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   they form a particular vibration that that vibration then translates into frequency.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   So in the video description, I found a couple of papers that for those of you who want to read up more about C60,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   the vibrational frequency of C60, there's a couple of papers, and this first one is by Jose Mendez and John Page
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Arizona State University,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   in which they basically get deeply into the vibrational frequency of C60
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   from a theoretical standpoint and then go through all of the different formulas,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   and, you know, honestly, I got lost after page one.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I am not a quantum mechanic scientist, disclaimer.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   These equations are beyond me.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I pretty much got through to calculus too in my schooling and I, you know,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   stopped at differential equations.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   And this stuff is, you know, it looks familiar, but I don't remember that far back.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I'm kind of an old fart.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   So, but the whole idea is this paper is available.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   It exists, the idea here, and this is the idea that I wanted to share is that
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   molecules have frequency because they vibrate, right?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And that those frequencies are not, are a combination of harmonics that are,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   are all of the different atoms that comprise the molecule itself,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   all moving in conjunction so that there's, you know, a lot of movement
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   and where there's a lot of movement, the frequency harmonics go up and down and change.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   And that's the concept, it's a vibrational frequency, not just like a tone, right?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   It's not a single tone.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And so with that in mind, okay, how could you use that?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   How could you use that for health?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   How could you use that for like, you know, I want to take C60?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Well, how would I take C60 as a frequency?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Well, then you introduce the concept of entrainment.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Now, if you remember from back in science and back, you know, like even if you weren't in a music class,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   you know that if you have two tuning forks, and one is just, just there,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   holding, you're holding the tuning fork in one hand and you haven't hit it on anything,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   you take another tuning fork and you'll whack it on the table and you hold them together, right?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Just like this.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   What happens is with if the tuning fork A begins to resonate, the tuning fork B that's not resonating
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   begins to resonate in sympathetic vibrations.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And what that means in science terms is everything is an oscillating circuit, right?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   We're all basically oscillators or in a meaning that we're all vibrating.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And so if something that's super vibrating faster than you gets close to you,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   it'll bring up your vibration as well.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   That's just science and that's called entrainment.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   And so one of the best videos that I could find to kind of show you in animation,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   if not in animation, but an example of entrainment is this right here.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I found this video of somebody who set up five different pendulums and all of them at different speeds.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And within 60 seconds, and now no one's doing anything, within 60 seconds,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   the vibrational frequency of all of the pendulums become entrained to one frequency, to one vibration.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   So as you watch this little tiny video, you'll see that the pendulums all start to basically
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   vibrate at the same frequency and speed right there.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   You see that?
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And that happens every single time you go to do these kinds of experiments.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   If you put two tuning forks together, the one that's not vibrating will start vibrating
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   exactly like the one next to it.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   You set up some pendulums.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   So here's the thinking in terms of C60 frequency as a way to take C60 for health.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And that is as a vibration.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Just like everything else you ingest, everything you come into contact with has a vibration.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   And guess what?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   You have a vibration.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   All of your atoms and all of your molecules are all vibrating.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And when you come in contact with something else that's vibrating, you become entrained to it.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Okay?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And this is science.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   And so the idea here, but the theoretical part, this is the theoretical part.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   We know that entrainment exists.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I just showed you, but the theoretical part is, let's say you have some diseased cells, right?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And because the cells are damaged, their vibrational frequency is, let's say, lower because they're
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   not at peak optimum health.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And then something comes along that's vibrating at peak optimum health and is vibrating.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   What happens is there's a sympathetic vibrational entrainment process that goes along.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   The faster one will slow down a little bit and the slower one will speed up a little bit
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   until they become the same, which means what?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Healing, right?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   It would be healing.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   It would be causing your cells to vibrate at a healthier frequency.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   And the theory is that stimulates healing.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Are you following me?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Because it gets complicated.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   But that's the theory, okay?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Now, I can't find any studies, by the way, out there.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   There are no studies that I could find.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And I went searching and all of us were only as good as we could search.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   But I couldn't find anything where anyone was actually doing this because let me tell you,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   if you could come up with frequencies that could cure diseases and treat illnesses,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   then there would be a really large industry in our country that has billions of dollars
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   that would be very threatened by the concept of frequency medicine.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   And you probably wouldn't be on the planet very long.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   I'll just leave it at that.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   But here you go.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   There's examples of two different guys, two different men in history, who both actually did that.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   I don't know if you've heard of these guys, but there's a Dr. Royal Raymond Reif,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   and a gentleman by the name of Georges Likovsky.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Both of these gentlemen were flourishing in what I call the Golden Age
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   of Bioelectrical Magnetics, and this was all about frequency medicine and using vibrational frequencies
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   to heal and to treat people.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And they both proved that it worked, and that's what's really kind of amazing,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   is that in the early 20th century, in the 1920s, 30s, these gentlemen, especially,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   well not especially, but both of them, Raymond Reif, and you can go and research this yourself.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   There's lots of stuff out there on YouTube.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   You name it.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   But Royal Raymond Reif, he's accredited towards inventing a microscope.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   There's a lot of people out there that call frequency generators, Reif machines,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   and there's no such thing.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Reif only invented a microscope.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And he had a friend, an electronics engineer, a friend of his develop a frequency generator,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   and then Reif spent his entire lifetime in trying to identify what frequencies did,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   what to certain kinds of viruses and diseases.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Everything from mumps to rubella to polio to you name it, right?
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And he spent 30 years developing and looking at it through his microscope
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   and playing frequencies into petri dishes of these different types of pathogens.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   And then as he would go up, you know, he would basically start out at like,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   "Okay, give me, you know, 1,000 hertz, 1,000, 1,000, 2."
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   And he would watch these organisms in his microscope until he hit the one frequency,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   like an opera singer and a wine glass, you know, a crystal glass,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   you know, that whole, you've seen it a million times commercials have it all the time, right?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   The lady just, you know, singing and she's singing in a crystal-led vase and a glass in the glassic
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   vibrates and it shatters.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Well, that's real, that's called entrainment.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   You reach that certain frequency where the molecules of the crystal can't hold together anymore
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and they just let go.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Well, that happens to living critters as well.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   So living pathogens, what Rife discovered was you could play frequencies to these living critters
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   and you could find the one that vibrates that cell walls until they just, they just basically disrupt.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Okay, and there's actually, there's actually videos of showing you how that looks on the internet right now.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   And so Rife spent his whole life identifying what frequencies would wipe out what pathogens
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   and he called those frequencies more, M-O-R, which stands for mortal oscillatory rate.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   And that would be the rate at which I could play a frequency that would destroy, let's say,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   the virus that causes mumps or chickenpox, right?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   And he did it.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And so he got, he, in the long story short, he tried to publish his work and became discredited,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   died a popper.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Okay, now George Islacoski, he approached the same concept of frequency as a healing modality
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   except he decided that instead of creating like, you know, a functional frequency generator,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   he created what he called a multi-wave oscillator with basically, this unit right here is one
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   of his original prototypes.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   It's called a multi-wave oscillator.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   This is your, let's think it's called the pulse modulator.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   This is what that is and it goes through a Tesla coil and there's the golden mean antennas
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   that he created, which are now called Lacoski antennas, long story short, sorry.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   But basically you'd sit between these two antennas, right?
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   And you would be subjected to an electrical field at which the electrical discharge is
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   across the antenna would kick off like a, like a xylophone of frequencies.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And so while you're sitting in a release high electrical field, you're subjected to frequency
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   ranges up and down the scale with the same concept of frequency as a healing to entrain
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   your body to the healing frequency for whatever may ale you and he was successful in reducing
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   tumors and reducing problems.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   He was very successful in Europe.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   He sold hundreds of these machines.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   When he came to the United States to promote it, he went to promote it to a group of doctors
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   and they had him, they were piloting them in a few hospitals around the country and this
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   guy got hit by a limousine one day and killed.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   What a coincidence.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   So the whole idea here is that these gentlemen, as before, like I mentioned just a little
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   bit ago, there are no studies because who pays for the studies, right?
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   But there's proof in their work.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   If you look at their work, their patents, the history of these two gentlemen and they're
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   just two of many that actually show that frequency can be a healing modality and it's just how
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   do you deliver it.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Now, like again, Raymond Reif delivered it through a functional frequency generator and
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.560]   Koski delivered it through a multi-wave oscillator, but that's my point.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.880]   You can use frequency.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.880]   These guys did it.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.880]   They proved it.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:38.080]   So there might not be any studies out there and today's academia, but the history shows
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:43.240]   that frequency has a healing modality is successful.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:50.400]   But let's talk about what people are doing today as it specifically relates to C60 because
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.520]   the concept here in this video is about C60.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.800]   Sorry, I go off on a tangent.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.880]   I spent 20 years studying bioelectric magnets.
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.880]   It's my thing.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.600]   But what I want to point out though is if you take the C60 frequency and the tremendous
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.520]   benefits that it provides you, the C60 has a molecule and if you ingest that as a molecule
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.560]   and what it does for your body, try to imagine if the frequency did the same thing.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.560]   That's theoretical.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.840]   It hasn't been shown.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.840]   It hasn't been proven.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.040]   There hasn't been a like Koski come along or Reif come along to prove that, but there are
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:25.120]   people out there who have already developed frequency products for C60 to be experimented
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.120]   on.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.400]   And as you know, right, we are the human trial.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.280]   There's no human studies on C60, but so here we are.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:39.160]   We are on the precipice of a new world to understand not only how C60 can help humans
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:46.520]   and animals, but also and plants and how can the frequency of C60 or let's just expand
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.840]   that the frequency of any molecule or any substance.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.160]   How can it help us in a healing modality?
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.160]   How can it help us for greater health?
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.880]   But in this context of this video, we're talking about the specific frequency of C60.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:07.760]   And so now there are two products on the market today that claim to have the frequency
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:14.520]   of C60 in a product that then you can purchase and then you can then experiment with.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.160]   The first one is called digital C60.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.240]   And if you go on their website and I'll show it to you a sec, basically it's digital C60
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.200]   by a company called Subtle Energy where they basically are claiming that we digitally we
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.920]   digitally captured the precise energetic signature of the carbon 60 molecule amplified
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:35.520]   it thousands of times and encoded it into digital media.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.520]   All right.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.360]   And so what you get if you purchase this product and give it a try, you get 18 media
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:47.840]   files for 147 USD headphones are recommended and but you know the thing is is that they
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.600]   have these great disclaimers where they're like hey you know this is all new stuff but
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.840]   if you don't give it a try and they actually offer a 90 day money back guarantee.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.860]   So you know you can give it a try if you really want to but the cool part about digital C60,
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.400]   this is our website links in the video description.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.920]   But okay there's two things that cool part is there's a sample.
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.160]   Not cool part is you know they don't tell you like exactly what is digitally captured
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.160]   mean.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.740]   And you know and I'm a tinker I want to know what do you mean what you would explain exactly
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.160]   what you mean so that I can analyze whether or not it's BS.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.160]   But I can't.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.560]   So I'm just saying I don't know if it's BS because here's a website and it tells you
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:35.440]   how great C60 is but this is these are findings based on studies of critters that ingested
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.840]   it with oil alright.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:43.620]   So when you put down and this is where I have a beef with websites like this when you put
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:49.520]   down the benefits of ingestion in on a website where you're selling the frequency there's
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.320]   no correlation there's no proof there's no study to back up the results with what you're
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.320]   claiming.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.440]   So this is not this is not appropriate in the reality of you can't claim the benefits
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:05.640]   of carbon 60 ingestion and then say hey you know what try our frequency that there's
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.400]   two separate things it should be like hey we've got a frequency thing completely experimental
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:13.920]   give it a try maybe you'll get the same I don't know but this is what it is but like
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.840]   I said you know they did have they do got some really good there's a large they have
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.720]   a very large disclaimer section here about what their product is right here and it just
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   basically says hey you know this is completely experimental it's subtle energy some people
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.840]   don't feel it so you know that's cool so that is cool okay.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:35.720]   So now the cool part is again is is is that you can sample it so down here there you go
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.360]   at the bottom of their webpage they give you a three minute demo and you can listen
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:45.800]   to it and it sounds like waves in the ocean but embedded in the sound file is the frequency
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:52.000]   of 660 so if you want to actually take it take a you know listen of what a C 60 well
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.880]   you won't hear it but it's the frequency of C 60 embedded in a sound file so they do
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:02.240]   give you a sample it's $147 so it's not a cheap endeavor to kind of experiment with
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.280]   this but hey I just want to point it out to you that it exists nothing wrong with these
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.600]   guys at all I you know I don't mean to discredit them at all I just don't think that people
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.840]   should be saying hey you know what if you adjust it this is all the great stuff that
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:18.720]   happens and then put it on a website you're selling a frequency I already said that okay
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.120]   so I'm just going to move on so that's digital 60 C 60 by subtle energy so there is a product
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:29.400]   out there for C 60 frequency the nether product out there that if you're interested in in
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:38.320]   doing this is the spooky two brand and they sell a lot of functional generators under
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.600]   the concept of Rife you know Raymond Rife and so they sell a whole bunch of different
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.840]   types of accessories and the generators and stuff like that and what they have is it's
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.760]   all tied to a software program that one's on your computer laptop and so basically you
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.360]   would buy their equipment and then you would in the software is for free so the cool part
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:02.920]   about spooky two is the software is free so you can download the software and go through
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.740]   their database and look up what the frequencies are and really kind of get a really good feel
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:13.680]   for the software and it's not simple or intuitive it's the only thing I don't like about spooky
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:19.960]   two it takes a long time to get good at it but it's all free the software is free so you
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.760]   just buy the stuff to plug in and then once you do then you could run what they call
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.960]   the molecular weight frequency program presets and so then you would go through the software
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:35.920]   select the preset for C 60 and then run that through an accessory and you've got your choices
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:42.400]   now spooky two molecular weight frequency for C 60 is way more complicated because this
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:48.040]   product up here by subtle energy it's just C 60 okay you buy 18 files you listen to them
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:52.680]   that's about as it simply puts heads on headphones on your get this one you got so you got a
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.480]   major learning curve uphill battle okay so let me kind of walk you through the concepts
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:01.120]   here first of all there's basically they got two different types of generators here's
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.800]   your price points for those of you always ask about price and here's all the different
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.520]   accessories and I'm not even a go there because I could literally make a one hour video just
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:13.600]   about spooky two stuff okay but what I do want to point out though is this is what the
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.760]   software looks like and this is just that one of the demos on how to run the molecular
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.080]   weight frequencies and you can see there's a lot of steps a lot of I mean this is not
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.880]   like oh you know this is really simple icon driven no no you need to you really need to
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.920]   know what you're doing you do learn it it's not like you know physics but it's not it's
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:37.240]   not simple but if you do it then you could then play the C 60 frequency and you could
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:44.040]   play it through a host of different things whether it be contact PMF paddles cold laser
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.880]   you name it there's all these different ways you can even do a quantum entanglement remote
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:54.000]   antenna thing or a plasma ball there's so many different ways you can have the frequency
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.160]   come out of the spooky two generator you could just have your pick of which one you want
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:03.400]   to use okay but the main thing is software free buy the equipment go to molecular weight
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.040]   frequency watch this little video clips in the videos in the description below and then
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.840]   you'll be able to play with it okay and then this is the price point for entry if you wanted
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:16.560]   to try a C 60 frequency that way okay and I just want to caveat again that there's no
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:22.660]   bridge there's no bridge between C 60 frequency and C 60 benefits when it comes to frequency
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:28.000]   okay so there's you got two separate worlds there's no bridge that ties the two 100% experimental
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.520]   but that's what makes this fun and that's what makes this a tink but I got a question
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:37.800]   and I wanted to share it with you guys do these products provide the actual C 60 frequency
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.880]   I'm sure some of you are wondering that like hey wait a minute you know like all of these
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:47.800]   guys are claiming right I mean they're claiming that they've got the frequency so they're like
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:52.960]   okay hey we've got the digitally captured precise and what does that mean I have no
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.320]   idea what energetic signature means it's proprietary stuff that this company has and
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.640]   you know kudos to them for developing it but like I said no clue what that means you know
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.120]   I don't know what that means from you know from a science standpoint what does that mean
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.720]   and then molecular weight frequency okay I sort of know what that means but it's buried
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.840]   within the software so I don't know so that's where my question marks are because here's
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:22.320]   the reality behind molecular frequency what is the frequency of C 60 is it a number and
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.480]   the answer is no it's not a number it's a harmonic so let's take a look at one of the
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:32.920]   papers that I think is a pivotal work on the frequencies C 60 and C 70 is it's done by a
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:41.120]   group of quantum mechanics you know quantum mechanics scientists okay very complicated
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:45.960]   again I got lost on page one but the idea here and this is what's so important about
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:54.320]   C 60 frequency and in general molecular frequency as a healing modality okay it's because this
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.480]   is the reality set you got a bunch of different scientists over the course of years tinkering
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:04.760]   around trying to figure out by theoretical calculations what the frequency of different
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.360]   of molecular's are now what if they're wrong and then you know I'm here you know because
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:13.640]   it's it's math right what if they got their math wrong and they're off and then what you're
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:18.280]   getting is like I don't know you know not C 60 and then you do an experiment and you
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:23.200]   expose let's say yourself or a plant to the frequency and something weird happens and
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:28.280]   you know but you can't for sure no hey is that really C 60 because somebody calculated
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:33.480]   it so you can see that this paper here these guys calculated but not only do they calculated
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:39.240]   they really get deeply into the whole concept of how the calculations are determined and
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:44.040]   I just want to read this one little paragraph here because what it comes down to is geometry
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.960]   amazing stuff I mean that's like again I kind of got lost on page one as far as I got
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.640]   those of you guys who are pretty much the majority of you guys are smarter than me you
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.160]   know I'm link in the video description below here you go I go find this stuff you guys
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:01.440]   figure it out okay but here although the full vibrational modes can be obtained from the
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.560]   above calculation scheme group theories introduced to help classify and analyze the results considering
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:13.520]   C 16 C 70 which have I H and D at 5 H symmetries respectively we find the following distributions
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:18.720]   with normal variations among different irreducible representation so this is the formula but what
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:24.720]   that means is that based on the shape okay and so here are the different shapes and the
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:31.200]   different vibrational modes here you go see these C 60 molecules is a C 70 down here but they can
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:38.000]   move in different directions in pulsate and vibrate in different ways and based on those
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.640]   different vibrations in different ways that they're pulsating okay they produce different
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:47.760]   vibrations and different frequencies so take that as a variable now put another thing in there and
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.160]   go hey they went and looked at these scientists that wrote this paper they went and looked at
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:58.640]   and the calculated and the experimental ramen vibrational frequencies for C 60 and checked this
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:05.440]   out and they did there was a study in 1991 95 in 2005 and another one in 2005 where they looked
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.560]   at all the different variables or the variations of the C 60 molecule and they measured the frequency
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:18.160]   and look at the frequencies they go up and down the lowest is like 491 and it can go all the way up
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:25.120]   to 1565 hertz okay so what does that mean that it means that this that every time they go to
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:31.200]   measure it it's a little different and that it's a harmonic of a bunch of different molecule sets
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:36.240]   because of the different shapes as the shape changes the frequency changes so it's not one
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:43.040]   number it's multiple numbers right that form a harmonic and every time they measure it it changes
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.880]   isn't that cool that's nature now here's the cool this is the thing i want to point out
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:54.320]   here's the calculations for the exact same and this is measured this is calculated and this is
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:28:00.720]   the point look at this one if the lowest over here is 491 for this particular formation over here it
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:08.480]   goes as low as 443 all the way up to 610 all right and it's this is a study in 1988 88
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:13.600]   2000 2001 in 1991 so when you and then of course they're their own measurement when they did their
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:20.000]   own calculations this is what their numbers were so they go all the way as high as 1726 and as low
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:27.520]   as 443 and so what this shows us this shows is that the calculations for a molecular frequency
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:36.640]   are not the same as the measured frequencies of the actual substance the molecule of C 60
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:44.080]   and it also shows that it's a harmonic of different frequencies as the molecule vibrates very important
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:51.440]   stuff why is this important well this is what i was thinking folks i was thinking that when you
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:59.120]   look at the work and i'm going to go back a couple of slides here let's say when you look at
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.840]   these guys whoops i didn't get there okay when you look at these guys right these two different
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:12.160]   products one of them is digitally captured okay so we don't know how they got their frequencies or
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:18.480]   what exact frequencies they're using but what did they capture them with right a spectrometer
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.640]   or if they don't get into it and if they don't get into it i don't know what it is and then you've
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.280]   got over here they're just going by molecular weight so spooky too and subtle energy there's
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.320]   very questionable whether or not they're actually playing the true C 60 frequency so what i was
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:38.080]   thinking is hey you know what because of the work that these guys did right here this dr jin and
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:44.080]   a dr pan i believe because of their work and the various different and they prove they prove that
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:50.560]   the different quantum mechanics methods lacked quantitative accuracy then what is your only choice
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.960]   if you truly wanted to experiment and truly wanted to experience the C 60 frequency right
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:02.400]   which you know now is a harmonic and and it's it's you need to it's actually has to come and this is
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:09.120]   my point it comes direct from the source meaning that you don't you don't take a product that's in
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:15.360]   somebody's software and then play it to yourself is that truly C 60 and the question probably is
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:22.400]   yeah i don't know maybe or do i actually take a sample of C 60 the actual direct source of the
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:29.600]   frequency and i use that as as the substance by which to then magnify the frequency that i will
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:36.400]   expose myself or my experimental plant animal whatever well that's the idea is you go direct to
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:42.720]   the source do not calculate the frequency but actually use the frequency direct from C 60
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.480]   so are there products out there that do that yeah yep yep of course it there's
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:52.880]   you're looking at the slide so these are the two products that are out there on the market today
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:58.400]   that actually will enable you to do that okay and there might be more i only got as far as these
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:04.480]   two okay looking around it's kind of hard because it is it's really it's hard you know because nobody
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.800]   just says hey we're you know we do frequencies from the source kind of advertising but the idea here
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   now is spooky two you know you those guys they also have a product called a scalar field generator
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.320]   okay one of them uh unique things about the scalar generator
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:24.320]   okay is that you can put a sample on it that will then take the frequency of the sample that you put
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:30.080]   on the the transmitter and then and then basically transmit that into the scalar field between the
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:35.440]   antennas and all you got to do is sit in the antenna you sit in between the antennas and then you become
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:41.680]   subjected to the frequency there you go so uh this puppy sells for 1600 dollars and it's based on
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:46.640]   scalar energy now this one over here is the 90 10 product line and you've probably seen me do a
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.960]   bunch of videos on these i love this product i've been dinking around with this for like since last
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:56.800]   year i'm very intrigued by it it does some really cool things but now this guy also can do a direct
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:02.480]   from the source frequency uh you know healing modality and by simply there's two you know basically
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:08.160]   two simple ways and one you could just you could do something with a pendant take an original frequency
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:14.240]   source like c60 and you can use this little pendant and add that frequency to the pendant so it's like
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:20.080]   programmable and unlike the scalar uh generator the scalar field you don't have to sit in the field
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.840]   it doesn't have to be plugged in and running and you're stuck there in the field if you want to have
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.960]   like quote you know a treatment or something or you want to experiment with it with the the 90 10
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:34.640]   products you can actually just program a device with it like a pendant or with this with this object
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:40.720]   here called a cube you can program any object like your glasses your keys a pen you know anything
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.840]   you want to carry around and then that thing itself then becomes embedded with the frequency of the
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:52.080]   source you put in there in this case a c60 and then you would have a little pendant that would be
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:59.200]   broadcasting the frequency of c60 to you as you ward around your neck so it is a direct from the
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:07.040]   source it takes the exact frequency from a source not a calculated frequency but a direct frequency
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.840]   and it either puts it into a field using a scalar generator or you can embed it into an object
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:18.240]   using a 90 10 the scalar uses a scalar technology and the 90 10 uses zero point or quantum technology
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.720]   to do so all right i'll get into a little bit more detail for those of you who like detail now
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:29.040]   but the big question here is this do you use c60 as a powder or do you use lipo full rain c60 and
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:35.440]   oil you know which frequencies are you going to subject yourself now we know that c60 and oil
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:44.960]   kudos to c60 labs by the way uh but hey if you use c60 oil okay um it's bio available so would
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:50.800]   you need to use a bio available source so that it's bio when you get the frequency is the frequency
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:56.000]   then bio available to you right question question we don't know it's all experimental now if i
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.040]   just use the powder the powder is not bio available to me but i do know that the molecules inside my
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.680]   body it's going to do what it does right but if i put c60 in water and drink it it does nothing
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:10.480]   for me it just goes out my back end so the or front whatever and then you know but the whole idea
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:16.560]   though is which one which c60 do you use to put in the field or to burn into a device so that's
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:22.160]   experimental there is no bridge between the two right results and and idea so nobody knows so
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.240]   if you're going to experiment then keep that in mind uh for me i just want to give a little
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:31.280]   testimony by the way i have all this equipment stuff okay i'm kind of one of those crazy people
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:36.320]   i have all this equipment so i had the uh frequency generators set up and i'm sorry there's no demo
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.000]   vid because i'm in the middle of my daughter's moving out of my house and it's just crazy right
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:47.520]   now and there's no way i can unpack and set up anything but right now the idea is um that
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:53.440]   you i actually had this set up for three months and uh one of those months i was doing experiments
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:58.480]   i actually took a vial of c60 and put it on the transmitter so for one whole month i was sleeping
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:05.680]   in a scalar field with the c60 frequency in the field did not feel a thing and i want to disclaimer
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:12.480]   right now that i have the uh i have the sensitivity of a carrot when it comes to this woo-woo stuff
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.440]   okay i don't feel nothing i mean the only time i ever feel the 90-10 stuff is when i really amped
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:24.160]   up to like a really high power but like this this the power level of a pendant for someone like me
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.760]   i wouldn't feel it i'm you know i just don't feel stuff like that i'm not a
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:33.920]   feely person uh so i didn't feel a thing and it was just sitting there so my next experiment when i do
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:38.480]   have time and space uh well i will set up my frequency generators again but this time i want
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:45.360]   to try lipofoolering uh instead of c60 right and use that as the direct source in the scalar field
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.680]   there you go now in terms of the cube i've actually created a frequency set with the c60
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:56.240]   oil in it and so there you go there okay now let's talk a little bit about the spooky scalar now
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:01.760]   scalar is uh is out there it's out there like this whole molecular frequency healing thing
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:07.040]   okay it's so theoretical it's so experimental but that's what makes it cool but i want to point
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:12.800]   out that the in the in the uh owner operator of spooky too is a guy named john white and he's
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:18.240]   pretty cool and he put out that he puts out tons and tons of videos and runs a forum and i mean he
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:23.120]   is so on it with trying to educate everybody uh and he could put this video out and so if you want
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:30.080]   to know more about scalar generators and the spooky product itself uh you know video link in the
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:35.200]   description below but what i want to point out though is that he gets into in this video he not
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:41.840]   only does he demonstrate it but he he shows you the the the basis for uh the idea uh how to use the
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:46.960]   product uh and then the whole idea is right here this is where by the way you'd never have these
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.120]   two that close to each other you want them on either side of the house uh the antennas the the
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.760]   lid of the box is the antenna uh and then so basically you would just be inside the field
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.520]   whatever between the antennas and then whatever you put on the transmitter you're going to be in
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.000]   that field it's invisible obviously and that's kind of how it works but then one of the things that's
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:11.120]   cool about this particular uh video when john white gets into it later on in this video there's a
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.840]   sigh there's a like he's right here he's actually showing putting water you can take subs you can
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:21.680]   take the transmitter let's say right you want it to burn uh a frequency into water you put the water
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.160]   on the receiver and the substance on the transmitter and then the water becomes charged with whatever
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.840]   that substance is whether it's oregano oil c60 whatever right so you can actually use the scalar
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:37.760]   generator for that uh and you can also then there's a picture in here somewhere so it's really hard
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.600]   to find there it is uh where you can take essential oils put them on the transmitter and then these
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:47.440]   essential oils their frequencies just like i was mentioning with c60 become broadcast inside the
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:52.640]   field but what my point is though i want to get to is that in the back of his video he gets into this
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:56.720]   a study where they start talking about scalar plasma technology and water is an effective
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:01.120]   a stress management protocol for healing and cellular for healing the cellular regenerative
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:07.120]   system so there are some studies with scalar energy as it as it pertains to healing modality
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.200]   that you may be interested in checking out this video is in the video links of my video
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:16.800]   right below if you want to learn more about scalar and yes you can again use this for c60
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:23.040]   frequency now the other one is the 90 10 now you can use the cube but the easiest one if you
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:28.080]   wanted to and it's the lowest price point uh it's you know like you could get the digital c60
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:35.120]   for 147 i think you get this power capsule for like 165 okay so you know if you just wanted to
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.200]   tinker and you just kind of want to get a feel or if you already have all this equipment you know
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   that's how you do it right but if you just wanted to give it a try if you have one of these pendants
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:48.400]   okay then you just there's a video right here uh this is on their website and all you do
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:54.880]   is you would basically take the spheres that are inside the tube right create a little packet
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.040]   just like that and then you would then take another piece of foil that you're going to burn
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:04.640]   the frequency on okay and then you would take and then in this example they're using a moringa leaf
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:11.600]   so they put the leaf in between on the the foil on the bottom which is what you're going to use
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:17.280]   and the little energy pack of spheres like that boom and you leave that there for 30 minutes
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.880]   and then whatever is in between the spheres that came out of the capsule and the foil
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:28.240]   gets burnt into the foil this is 90-10 uh how you do it okay so in this case you would just take
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:34.080]   a drop of c60 oil and you would put it on that foil put the spheres on top of it and you would
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:41.200]   burn the c60 oil into that foil and then once you burn the c60 oil into the foil yeah excuse me you
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:46.720]   unfold it take one of the spheres is just take a little piece of the foil just like that
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:53.280]   and then you would take one of the spheres and you would wrap it in the foil that has the c60
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:59.120]   frequency in it or in this example moringa and that's it you put it back in your capsule and you
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:05.200]   have just added the c60 frequency to your 90-10 power capsule and that's how you could also
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:11.680]   tink with it if you wanted to try what c60 frequency is so that's it uh sorry this kind of got longer
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:16.720]   than i thought i was going to get but i wanted to point out the reality of you know what is you
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:22.400]   know molecular frequency how can you use it has there been any science that it's beneficial no
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:29.360]   but yes right yes in the early 20th century after everyone who's did it disappeared
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:35.040]   and not anymore right now but hey you know look in the past there is and then how are people
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.360]   doing it today what are the current products should you go direct from the source frequency
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.840]   or a calculated frequency and then if you wanted to do which ones what did it cost and how you did it
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:50.800]   and i wanted to share all that research with you i find this stuff fascinating i hope you do too
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:56.080]   and thank you you know thank you if you stuck around this long i want to say mahalo thanks for
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.480]   staying with me thanks for watching my videos i'm glad and i hope that this was interesting
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.960]   for you i hope you learned something new and everything i chatted about all my videos earlier
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:10.800]   for the alt c60 part three part series are in the are below and also lastly if you got any
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:15.360]   questions about any of this stuff i would i'm more than happy to talk about it at any time it's
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:19.760]   or a whole bunch of other folks at the telegram c60 chat group there's a link in the video description
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.800]   to join our chat group and you got any questions come on over just ask away but thank you mahalo
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.040]   and I really do appreciate your time today.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.020]   See ya, bye.
