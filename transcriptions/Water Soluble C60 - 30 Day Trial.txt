[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and in this video
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.480]   I'd like to share with you my 30-day trial of a water-soluble C60 product. It's also known as a
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.440]   Florinol. Now I just recently did a video about these this class of product this new C60 product
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.160]   that's on the market and I'll put a link to that video in the video description if you'd like no
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.320]   more about it. So my trial here was essentially just 30 days of trying a Florinol product. This
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.980]   went from April 14th to May 13th this year. The product's name is an SFW200 premium and it's
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.600]   produced by a company called Space Lava. Now the compound that's specific to this product is a
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:48.140]   blend of a C60 Florinol and a C70 Florinol. So the chemistry nomenclature would be C60 OHNN
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.640]   plus a CA70 OHNN which you wear NN which would be the hydroxy pairs attached to the C60 molecule
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.880]   is greater than 40. That's all the solar would disclose. I'm not sure what each one of these
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.840]   different Florinols were or what the concentrations of each is in terms of ratio. This is it. This is
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.880]   the description. Now the dosage, there was two different dosages and one was just for general
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.720]   wellness. These are recommendations by Space Lava where I just followed the general wellness
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.360]   which was one drop per 15 kilogram body weight daily. Their other recommendation was for
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.280]   individuals with more acute issues to take two drops. I went with general wellness. Now the
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.960]   objective which I need to make really clear here is I don't have a laboratory or access to one
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.560]   so I couldn't do any deep type of testing but what I did was simply just take the Florinol for
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.600]   60 days and compared that to taking C60 which I have done for many many years. So I am very
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.760]   familiar with the effects of C60 on my on my person and I wanted to experience okay what you know
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.320]   what it was like taking Florinols and what was the difference and that's really it's completely
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:07.240]   completely my opinion and I want to stipulate that clearly. Okay so now how the the manufacturer
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.680]   or the seller describes the product is simply this is that SFW or 200 premiums stimulates
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.360]   collagen biosynthesis the main component of connective tissues it possesses powerful antioxidant
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.560]   properties neutralizing free radicals and preventing their damage or the damaging effects on body
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.840]   bodily tissues. It reduces inflammation improves blood circulation and provides overall anti-depressant
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.000]   immune regulating and sedative effects and that's how they described it and this is what it looks
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.040]   like. So now I've got it compared to their C60 oil product which they sent me along with the
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.920]   Florinol product to try thank you very much Dimitri. This was something that was provided to me I did
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.800]   not buy it so I kind of want to point out right here you know this is kind of a new thing for C60
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.080]   people who take it that when it's in water it's clear water you can't see it there's nothing
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.960]   floating and so you can just see right here that you're basically just taking water with the
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.680]   Florinol in it and so that's what the label looks like and this is what was provided to me
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.400]   by Dimitri so thank you very much for that. So that's what I've been trying for the last 30 days
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.320]   and to kind of give you a little bit of an example here this is their oil product they're C60 in oil
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.640]   product and basically it looks just like any other one you can see the color it's kind of lighter
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.000]   a color than the one I make you know but the idea here is they also make a CC oil product.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.200]   So now here's my experience again some background so I think for people who don't know me I've been
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:43.320]   taking C60 in oil since 2017 so it's been quite a few years and I have also in that time frame
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:50.200]   have taken different dosages and just you know basically taking it in all the different scenarios
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.760]   you can imagine and one of those scenarios is I often will stop taking it you know for like two
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.440]   weeks four weeks six weeks in order to you know just not allow my body to get used to having it
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.280]   it's that whole a hermetic effect of trying to you know basically randomize your supplementation
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.840]   so your body doesn't get stuck with it so so I do definitely know because of all the years
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:22.760]   I've been taking C60 in oil what it feels like to have it to be taking it right and what it feels
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.040]   like to not be taking it and I'm very familiar with that I've been doing this for seven years
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.080]   and I do know so I just want to stipulate that's my background here in terms of being able to make
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.560]   this comparison so the very first one that I wanted to kind of just share with you is
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.600]   I only kind of have two tests where I could actually make a fair comparison and the two tests are
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:52.360]   how my body reacts to toxins on and off C60 and then another one is how my body reacts to sunlight
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.160]   on and off and I get and again you know this these experiences that I'm commenting on is
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.360]   something that is shared by almost all the other C60 individuals that are taking it that I know
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.960]   I mean I read this all the time in forums and in our chat group so I'm experiencing the same thing
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.200]   you guys are so here's what I experienced specifically though when on C60 and when on
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.160]   Fullertonols when it regards to MSG now I've done multiple tests on myself with MSG I'm one of
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.400]   those individuals who's highly sensitive to it uh it's it's a neurotoxin and it really will mess
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.640]   with your brain but for me I'm actually I think allergic to it because if I take it if I eat
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:40.120]   anything with it and I'm not taking C60 then when I eat it I will break out in hives and I will get
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.760]   incredibly itchy and that happens 100% of the time okay so I started taking C60 years ago and I
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.560]   haven't had any issues with MSG while I'm taking C60 it's in those brief periods where I stop
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.840]   taking MSG or you know when I stop taking C60 where I'll go eat something and then I'll have a
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:04.920]   physical reaction to it so when I was taking Fullertonols this is my my my protocol is I've
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:12.040]   been you know I take C60 every day I had been and so I stopped at the beginning of April I waited
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:18.920]   two weeks right to just kind of let my body flesh it out if you look at how long does C60 last in
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.360]   the human body research it's anywhere from you know three to ten days depending on organ so they
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.760]   all kind of agree ten days is about when and your body's eventually going to flesh it out so I
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.240]   went past ten days in following that protocol so that I could start fresh on Fullertonols so after
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.680]   two weeks I started my 30-day trial and then during that trial I waited two weeks for the kind of
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.640]   Fullertonols to kind of get inside me you know and get saturated with them and then I tried the
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:52.120]   MSG test which was simply going out and eating a whole lot of Japanese food and foods that I know
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:59.480]   are very high in C60 I'm sorry in MSG and I had a reaction which was something I never would have
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.800]   if I took just regular C60 in oil but here's the deal although I had a reaction on a severity level
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:12.120]   compared to what I normally would experience the severity was far less so there's two things that
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:18.600]   came from that one a I had a reaction even to begin with and I never do on C60 oil but this you
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.840]   know it wasn't so bad it was I would say if it was like I had to give a percentage I would say it
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.840]   was probably maybe 30 percent as bad as a normal reaction to MSG were again breakout and hives get
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.160]   religion so that was what happened to me so I was kind of really surprised that it happened because
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:39.640]   I haven't had an MSG experience for a while so then the other one too though was nicotine now
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.880]   I'm a cigar smoker and I enjoy one a day and so if for those of you who smoke cigars you will know
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:53.080]   what this what what I mean by this is I before I ever started taking C60 I mean I don't remember
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:08:01.000]   having an incident of kind of like taking too much nicotine for years and years but before C60 in
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.560]   the many years because I've been a cigar smokers in my since my 20s you know I every on occasion and
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.600]   you know this happens to you if you're a cigar smoker on occasion you'll get a really strong cigar
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:18.040]   or somehow you get exposed to too much of your own second hand smoke and you will kind of get
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:24.440]   way too much nicotine you kind of do a little OD on nicotine and I refer to that as gagging out
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.160]   you just get nauseous and it's just like you just had way too much nicotine it's one of the
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.440]   reasons I don't smoke Cuban cigars they're just way too strong and prefer Dominicans but I digress
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:43.560]   so I haven't had a basically a cigar OD nicotine thing experience for many years like way before I
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:51.000]   get all of a sudden now two weeks into this I was outside having a cigar and you know they're just
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.960]   and I just kind of gagged on it it was just one of my big cigars and I hadn't gagged on it for
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:01.560]   quite a long you know I was so shocked and I was so sick and it was only in retrospect that I
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:07.800]   realized that I hadn't been gagged I hadn't had a you know gag out moment for seven years right
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.760]   basically or you know as far as I can remember so it was kind of a kind of a surprise I didn't plan
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:17.800]   on this being a test because I smoked cigars every day I didn't even consider that the C60 was
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:23.720]   actually helping me you know so I was very shocked by that but that's my takeaway just like with the
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:31.160]   MSG takeaway my takeaway on my you know accidental nicotine overdose was that wow you know this this
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:39.400]   was C60 was keeping it suppressed for years but Folarnals had zero effect on what happened to me
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.880]   and by the way just as a little side note inhaling hydrogen when that happens
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.720]   this is the best response you could ever have I was I was literally flipped 180 degrees in 20
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:56.440]   minutes on hydrogen anyway so yeah so the nicotine thing was yeah it didn't have any of the Folarnals
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:02.280]   had no beneficial effect at all in that in that regard in that specific accidental test
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:07.320]   so the another one too now is the reaction to prolonged exposure to sunlight so that's something
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.560]   that you guys know I mean there this has been commented on in the telegram chat group
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:19.800]   people who take C60 oil don't sunburn and so you know so I haven't had a sunburn in years like
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.760]   mine you guys know I used to live in Hawaii right so I've only been on the mainland two years so
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:29.640]   I've had 30 something years of living in tropical paradise and I was exposed to a lot of sunlight
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:35.560]   and then even you know where I live now so I never and haven't been getting sunburns for as long as
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:41.080]   I've been taking C60 so what I did was obviously was wait until I got saturated with Folarnals
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.600]   and at the three-week mark you know went to a ballgame it was in sitting in the bleachers by
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:53.080]   third base direct sunlight this was actually part of my experiment let's go to the ballpark
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.880]   and so in watching the baseball game I'm sitting in just in the bleachers fourth row right behind
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:04.040]   third base the dugout and I'm exposed 100 percent to sun and so and I wore shorts and a t-shirt
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.840]   and so that was my test I knew I was going to be at the ball game because I normally do not like
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:16.120]   sitting in hot sun I just don't do that I just have tried avoid it so in what happened was is I
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:22.200]   brought my daughter along who's pretty white and so we're sitting there together watching the ball
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.960]   game and essentially there's two hours of direct sunlight until she got so pink we had we had to
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.680]   leave there was just like you know she was in danger and it was over 80 degrees so here's what happened
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:38.840]   though she got pink had a light sunburn the next day she doesn't take 660 oil no matter how much I
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.520]   try to get her to take it you know it's your kids right you give them bottles and they just ignore
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:50.200]   you anyway I digress yet again so it was two hours direct sunlight she got sunburn and we're
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:57.000]   fairly the same whiteness you know and I had zero effect nothing I didn't even turn pink I got
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.920]   brown I got browner you know I get then I normally am but that's it I mean I didn't burn that's the
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:09.480]   third part of this test was that the full or not was doing the same thing that C60 does and so that
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:16.280]   was great so my overall conclusion on my 30-day trial was that there is an effect that you do feel
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:22.600]   some C60 effects and it's weird that it was too that it was a complete different one between toxins
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.960]   and sunlight so you know so the conclusions that I have that is that you know there's two real
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:33.720]   questions is it like is it as good as C60 that's one question the second question is is it better
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:39.320]   than C60 so I just want to nail the second one right out I did not find it better but I did find
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:47.720]   it similar to C60 just taking C60 but if I had to make a choice between the two I would definitely
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:53.400]   keep taking C60 in oil because the fact that I you know the whole nicotine thing was surprising
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.800]   and the fact that I had the reaction the way I did with MSG so that's my conclusion guys that's
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.080]   just my personal opinion you know I highly recommend I mean this was this was really interesting that
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.840]   you know you guys try the product try either you know there's space labas or any other full
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.680]   and all but you know I think it's worth a try because you know we're all biohackers so when I
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.840]   give it a try anyway that's my experience just wanted to share it with you thank you very much
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.800]   for hanging out with me I appreciate your guys watching the videos and and sticking out this far
