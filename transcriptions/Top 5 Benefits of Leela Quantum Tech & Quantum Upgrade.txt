[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.760]   Kalmer and in this video I'd like to share with you the top five benefits of
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.440]   Leila Quantum Tech and the Quantum Upgrade service. I'm making this video
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.160]   because someone asked me in a comment section of another video about my
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.080]   experience with Leila Quantum Tech and the Quantum Upgrade and being one of the
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.760]   individuals who is the very first one to actually have a quantum block, one of
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.480]   the very first subscribers. Literally one of the first three people to start the
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.440]   telegram channel. I've been friends with Philip for years and I'm active user of
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.680]   the products and the service and so I had to really think about that. I'm you
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.140]   know because it's been a few years now and I'm really like you know like what
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.040]   is it you know what is it all about you know trying to like what's my elevator
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.080]   pitch and so I'm thinking wow you know there's a little bit more to it than
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.080]   what I can describe in an elevator but there's definitely top benefits you
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.400]   know there's there's and I kind of narrowed it down to like what are the
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.680]   top five things that I really get from Leila Quantum Tech and the Quantum
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.760]   Upgrade and that you know if you are you know hang out in the telegram chat
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.680]   group or you've read the website or read some of the studies I mean no one else
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.440]   probably other than myself and Philip has actually read everything you know and
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.680]   or read all of the different posts and all of the different stories and all the
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.040]   different testimonials and I have it's been three years and I'm an active
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.760]   moderator of the group and actively you know very much active and actually
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.840]   became an affiliate a few years ago. So you know I thought I just put it all
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.400]   together in one video so that people if you're new to it or if you've been doing
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.680]   it for a while you know this is it might be a good reminder of all the things
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.280]   you could do and all the things that are possible especially if you're new and
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.840]   you want to you know you're just like you heard it you know you watched an
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.640]   interview and you kind of got excited and bought it
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.280]   jumped right in with both feet without really truly realizing the incredible
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.760]   benefits. So there's there's a lot more than than than what you initially think
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.160]   I think is probably the best way to say it. So I kind of narrowed it down
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.320]   to a you know the five and so I'm going to be talking about
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.040]   quantum healing, quantum broadcasting, raising your consciousness,
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.440]   gifting positive energy and manifesting intent. To me these are clearly
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.440]   above all things you know some of the most incredible things you could do
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.840]   and with this you know the you know the devices and or with
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.720]   the service itself and also you know and just how it interacts with you and
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.480]   others. So these are my top five and let's just jump right into it.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.240]   Now obviously if you've been on the telegram chat group there's people that
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.480]   jump in on you know every now and then and they're just like hey I tried the
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.680]   free trial or hey I you know I bought a capsule and
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.640]   you know nothing's happening and you know then you just kind of this is what
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.840]   pops in my head when I read those things and they're like hey you know
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.280]   nothing's happening but I just want to say to you that you know that one of the
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.920]   the number one top benefit is is going to be automatic.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.400]   It's just like you don't even have to do anything it's just happens for you
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.720]   and the reason I could make that statement is because Leila
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.400]   has you know Philip specifically the founder and owner
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.360]   is just an incredible individual if you ever met him and talk with him
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.520]   personally and in one of the things that's most amazing about
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.280]   but what he's doing is he takes a huge chunk of the profits
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.800]   and funnels that into commissioning third-party studies
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.080]   with all these different institutes and different scientists
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.360]   and because you know because he's I don't know I don't know what really drives
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.600]   that actually never did ask him but I really find that to be quite
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.760]   enticing it because I have I'm very much a you know an armchair scientist
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.680]   and and the fact that that's why I'm really so much into it because he spent
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.760]   so much money trying to validate the claims that that he makes with his
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.280]   products and his service and those third-party
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.400]   independent scientists and in institutions have been evaluating
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.120]   what the devices do and now what the what the upgrade service does
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.240]   at a physical level you know doing control groups and
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.120]   placebo studies and sham studies and all these types of
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.040]   you know NIH level types of studies that you would find in academia
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.880]   and so right off the bat if you're wondering like hey what's happening and
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.720]   how come nothing's going on well the reason is is because
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.520]   the physical evidence that we have now with just numerous studies and if you
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.160]   go on to the website over here at Leila Tech
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.960]   right and you can just go right in here into research
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.800]   and you can read all of the studies have been posted is 100 percent
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.440]   you know transparency all the studies are here
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.880]   the blood studies that you know you name it and if you go over here to quantum
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.120]   upgrade and you go into the research section it's the exact same material
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.040]   but specific to quantum upgrade so you know I really want to point that out
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.120]   that the evidence is there and so there's stuff that's happening and it's an
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.200]   automatic you just the moment you're you're embraced by this
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.960]   heightened or amplified quantum energy that's being sent to you
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.480]   or you're in the presence of it physically these things are happening and
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.200]   you know people all you know they often say
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.960]   hey I don't feel anything well what does it feel like when your blood
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.280]   improves with the ability for it to absorb oxygen you know what does it feel
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.040]   like when when your red blood cells are strengthened the membranes are
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.000]   strengthened around them and literally they get healthier
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.880]   in the presence of quantum energy or in a you know like what's it feel like
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.400]   to have you know you have a higher white blood cell account
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.880]   you know what sorry white blood cell count and and what does that even
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.320]   translate to and so you know some of these things that are happening
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.400]   are very specific and if you read the studies and and I know people
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.040]   probably aren't going to gravitate to a 30-page study about blood tests
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.080]   you know which is sort of why I make these videos
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.440]   but the idea here is that you are getting a markedly improvement
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.000]   in the in the attributes of your blood which affects your entire body
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.280]   you know just like oil is important to your car's engine well
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.880]   you're when it wouldn't run without it same thing with your blood
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.400]   and so you're able to uptake oxygen better your red blood cells are
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.760]   strengthening you're getting more white blood cell
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.880]   count in your bloodstream which is improving your immunity and your
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.560]   ability to fight off pathogens and and viruses and things and
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.280]   you know also you know there's this part of your blood that that
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.320]   creates clotting and it actually decreases the
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.240]   that you know harmful clotting and then another thing that's most recently
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.920]   come out is that it's been demonstrated in the lab
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.600]   through scientific testing that it actually increases ATP
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.240]   now for those of you who are not familiar with that it's
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:59.480]   ATP is essentially your cellular energy you know
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.320]   power factory if you think of your body as a machine and you have little
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.120]   power factories in every single cell of your body
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.880]   and it's your mitochondria and it generates the energy
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.240]   by which you even function as a living being
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.560]   it's ATP and now they're finding out that you know just exposure to quantum
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.800]   energy whether through the upgrade or in the presence of a device
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.320]   is increasing at 20 to 25 percent and there's really
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.000]   not a lot out there in the world right now that that can do that
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.600]   you know i mean there's other types of modalities and technologies and
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.000]   things but that is remarkable and it's been measured in the lab now
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.960]   and you're increasing in that you have more energy now
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.760]   but you know it's at such a cellular level you know i i totally i totally
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.120]   empathize with people that you know kind of just sign up for the
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.720]   service and and buy a device and go hey i don't feel anything well
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.800]   how would this feel i honestly don't feel it myself
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.320]   um and so but it's happening and it's been proven and and there's evidence
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.840]   and then the last thing is the thing that's automatic is it's going to
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.920]   improve your bio energetic markers now for those of you who aren't familiar
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.960]   with bio-energetics kind of think of it like the concept of
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.560]   acupuncture which if you're familiar with that it's just
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.400]   essentially a practitioner who is act you know is
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.480]   basically manipulating the energy flow of your body through
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.880]   channels called meridians and yet they use needles some people use
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.400]   all sorts of different you know you can use more than just needles but the
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.200]   idea behind chinese traditional medicine is the
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.320]   understanding of how energy flows through the body
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.680]   and bio-energetics is that it's just the western
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:46.840]   you know western i guess health alternative health view of chinese
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.960]   traditional medicine and so you know they translate it in
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.720]   and they call it bio-energetics but it's the same concept
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.480]   and so what happens is if you know if you get a device that can measure the
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.000]   energy flowing through your body then you're going to be able to see
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.440]   incredible improvements in all of the markers that are going to
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.040]   measure how that energy passes through your different
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.040]   meridians and especially how your organs are able to then
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.360]   utilize that energy better and sometimes you might have blockages
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.480]   that's what the whole needle thing is for in acupuncture and
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.400]   one of these things does is it relieuates those blockages
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.320]   of energy to the various organs according to the meridians
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.160]   and you're getting this incredible improvement in just energetic health
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:36.200]   and so these are the the most profound
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.360]   you know realizations and and and just results that have come from these
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.200]   studies and they're guess what they're happening automatic it is literally
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.680]   number one top of the top five benefits is you are getting this incredible
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.640]   improvement in your health physically and so now if you want to learn a little
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.000]   bit more about that if you go on to the two sites so this
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.080]   is leila quantum tech site and if you click right here on athletes
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.360]   you're we're finding out right now that ever since these studies started
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.800]   coming out more and more professional athletes and
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.520]   amateur athletes are just going hey wait a minute
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.160]   and they're utilizing this these devices i mean when you are in an environment
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.760]   where you know a millisecond or a second it makes the difference between new
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.760]   winning and losing that race right or that competition
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.880]   this is a cutting edge and now we've getting more and more athletes are
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.120]   starting to use these devices to just give them that little bit of edge that
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.120]   you know that they need to be a successful in in their endeavors and so
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.080]   on leila quantum tech you'll see this new section on the website
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.880]   called athletes and it talks about the different athletes
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.840]   that are utilizing the devices and the services
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.200]   you go over here to leila i'm sorry the upgrade
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.800]   website you click right here on the top and it's got another the same section
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.640]   on athletes and how these athletes are interacting with the
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.640]   quantum upgrade service and how it's making them perform
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.080]   better and they're and you know it's it's giving them that little edge and
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.960]   these people are actually reporting back saying yeah
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:10.040]   it works i'm actually doing better with the exposure to quantum energy so
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.440]   it's real and it's it's actually got a lot of roots in science so
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.200]   that's the very first benefit it's remarkable it's amazing
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.840]   and you know as more and more studies come out i think we're going to learn
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:26.040]   even more about what the amplification of quantum energy does to our bodies
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.800]   because remember everybody we are quantum beings
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.280]   and our bodies are we have a quantum biology now the other thing about quantum
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.080]   healing and this is the other side of quantum healing
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.880]   in addition to that physical stuff that's going on
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.520]   there's a remarkable thing that's happened over the last three years is
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.280]   more and more people have come on and are trying to service and are buying the
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.280]   devices and exposing themselves and their families to this energy
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.640]   and so not only are we doing these scientific studies not we but phillips
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.200]   doing these scientific studies but we're also
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.240]   experiencing all these incredible testimonies about things that are
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.880]   happening some of them have been are we're
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.960]   phillips trying to validate with you know lab results and having scientists
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.080]   look at some of the things people are reporting and other things are just
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.120]   happening and it's really more testimonial based
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.040]   however you know it's when you have multiple people you kind of rule out
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.520]   the placebo effect and you and you kind of just
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.280]   start looking into some of these things is actually really happening so
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:31.240]   one of the things about quantum healing from this aspect of it
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.040]   is that if you if you ever go to my blog
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.720]   I have a tinker's academy blog I do different things in my blog but
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.400]   I have this one section called quantum energy and so what I've done is I've
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.560]   actually done a series if you haven't seen it
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.240]   I've done a series of videos on the very specific things
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.560]   that people have been reporting some of them are just testimonial based like I
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.200]   said and some of them have the studies included
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.480]   and so if you just go to this page called the benefits of quantum healing
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.880]   you'll see the video series that I started this year covering things like
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.880]   you know we've had reports of improvement in individual with autism
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.600]   and there was actually study being done with that
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:15.160]   people their ability to cope with EMF we have testimonial evidence on ADHD
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.240]   improvements in in that condition ATP again and here's
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.080]   allergies we've room this is to me the most
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.960]   remarkable finding but in the last three years as we've discovered
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:32.040]   that with the use of quantum energy and frequencies
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:38.280]   people with allergens are able to basically deal better with whatever
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.320]   bothers them and not only is the concept here of
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.400]   allergens but it's also toxins and having those toxins
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.320]   rendered inert where they don't necessarily
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.160]   affect you like they would if they weren't basically if you know
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.800]   exposed to quantum energy prior to your exposure to it
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.160]   then we can watch this video about more about that but you know I got a video
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.000]   on improvements in sleeps improvement in pet health
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.400]   the quantum garden is a great video about how quantum energy works
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:14.040]   and helps plants and of course there's other types of videos I've done where
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.760]   you know an EMF exposure in in electric vehicles
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.920]   EMF exposure to toxins in the environment specifically this one
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.880]   chemtrails in snow so long story short I'm going to
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.560]   keep doing these videos called benefits of quantum healing
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.280]   to kind of chronicle these amazing discoveries that we're finding out
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.400]   through the telegram chat group as well as the studies
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.040]   but right there is this list and it's real and it's happening and it's an
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.200]   amazing aspect and so bottom line of the top five benefits
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.560]   of Leila quantum tech and the upgrade service
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.080]   is going to be quantum healing and just the amazing
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.240]   properties of all of these devices and services and how they could
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.720]   really improve health of pets plants and people
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.760]   the next one is number two is quantum broadcasting and
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.760]   this literally is the entire business model
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.800]   of quantum upgrade and it's the idea of broadcasting
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.880]   energy and so now if you're a device owner
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.120]   you've got your own all of your devices are just emanating quantum energy
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.200]   and then your blocks are doing it you know even way more so
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.640]   and then the quantum upgrade is quantum broadcasting where
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.320]   instead of you buying your own device you know you're actually
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:38.040]   you know subscribing to Leila's you know their facility that's actually
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.320]   broadcasting that those that that energy and those frequencies
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:46.360]   directly to you through a thing called quantum entanglement
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:51.240]   which again is another actual science the idea real quick for those of you
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.600]   are not familiar with quantum entanglement and it's been proven
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.080]   in quantum physics there's actually a recent Nobel prize awarded
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.320]   to a scientist group that actually proved quantum entanglement really
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.400]   exists i mean really really exists it's no longer debatable
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.640]   and that's the idea that two things can be at distance and time
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.960]   apart doesn't matter how many miles doesn't matter how long a time
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.560]   but these two things can be linked together in the quantum field
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.360]   and that doing something to one can affect the other
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.600]   that's really it and so what quantum upgrade service was
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.160]   after the devices were out there on the market and fill up develop quantum
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.240]   upgrade to provide you know just another option
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.560]   to experience quantum energy for people who didn't want to buy a device or
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.120]   couldn't afford some of these devices and they could
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.280]   get involved at a much lower price point so you know kind of more options to
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.920]   the consumer based in terms of trying to
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.320]   spread this technology out through the world
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:55.160]   so right off the bat the quantum upgrade if you're familiar with that service
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.760]   you know you can sign up to have that quantum broadcast to you
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.920]   to you as a person people you know friends and family
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.800]   your pets cats and dogs your car your phone your home
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.640]   and property and also your business and you can have that energy
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.480]   come to you but it's also not just energy recently
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.840]   did a video about the frequencies were added on a couple of months ago
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:23.160]   so not only can you have you know energy broadcast to you and then get
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.280]   all of these benefits that i talked about and this is
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:30.200]   all real okay you can have that energy sent to you and you can benefit from
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.320]   it that way but now we've introduced or I'm sorry
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.320]   Philip has introduced frequency and so now you can also
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.000]   send frequencies and frequencies as a whole another
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.360]   you know ballgame it's literally like energy by itself is awesome
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.280]   frequency is another whole level whole another book of awesomeness that you
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.880]   add on to this to this incredible benefit list so
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.880]   the frequencies now are just are pretty amazing because now you can send
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.120]   frequencies and frequencies do a lot more
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:01.320]   than just energy and so that's kind of the really cool thing
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.720]   about you know the benefits of this of lela quantum tech and quantum upgrade
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.440]   is this broadcasting now just if you're a
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.760]   device owner obviously if you want to basically expose people to energy and
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.560]   frequency you can have them in the proximity of the device
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.160]   within that device is field you know parameter
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.400]   or you can also use your blocks to actually send frequencies by just
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.360]   placing you know you could a picture of the person
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.480]   or sample of their of them you know you know and
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.360]   you know the energy will find them in the quantum field
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.760]   just as an example a fingernail or a lock of hair
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.160]   is literally going to contain that that person's or that individual
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.960]   cat dog whatever you know DNA and DNA is at the end of the day is
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.400]   it's an antenna and it's going to go out there and find that person and that's
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.640]   going to you know connect that energy to them
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:57.160]   and or the frequency so you can you can use your blocks to send it a
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.360]   distance farther than the field stretches out so
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.960]   block owners you've got all the all the you've got everything you need to
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:06.280]   actually you know do your own upgrade service
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.320]   for your friends and family but if you're not you know if you don't have a
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.280]   block you still with your within the field of a card
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.400]   or a capsule or a coaster or any of the you know anything
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.360]   that's been charged you're within that field and you're getting that energy
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.640]   and frequency so being able to send that out
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.000]   and then reap the benefits of it is is pretty amazing
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.360]   and so quantum broadcasting is definitely a benefit
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.800]   to you and to anything that you want to
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.840]   send it to it which kind of leads to the next one here
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:41.560]   which in a different way but the third one is raising your consciousness
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.960]   um this is something that when you look at oh hey you know i got this thing
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.600]   and what's it going to do for me well there's this concept here that
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:56.280]   that so many of us are experiencing which is this
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.640]   you know this rays of consciousness and you know
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.160]   it can also be heard of you know or thought of like hey you know i want to
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.320]   increase my vibration and and and you know that sort of thing so you know
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.640]   the reason i'm kind of just him and in Han is
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:14.760]   is it's really hard to explain in layman's terms i'm just so close to it
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.440]   but so one of the things that philip has done over the years is
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.000]   when the product first came out he kind of was
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.880]   himself having kind of a challenge explaining
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.920]   levels of consciousness and so over time i think about two years ago maybe
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:34.360]   um you know philip kind of leveraged the work of an author
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:39.000]   Richard Hawkins he wrote a book like 30 years ago and did all of this theoretical
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.640]   work on the concept of consciousness and what the levels were
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.400]   and so the layla and quantum upgrade have kind of adopted
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.680]   the the quant you know basically it's called the honkins
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:56.120]   uh you know i think i went sorry hawkins levels of consciousness
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.800]   you know um you know i guess i would call it a construct okay
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.520]   so it's a construct that someone came up with a
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:11.080]   guy named hawkins basically to explain this this idea of levels of consciousness
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.280]   and then he puts some numbers to it and and personally
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:18.120]   i don't i don't worry about the numbers the numbers are meaningless to me
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.560]   because if you when you really spend a lot of time
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.680]   uh doing the inner work and and and working with
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:29.000]   your own ability to elevate yourself and consciousness that
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.640]   there are no numbers in the quantum field
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:36.120]   there just aren't there's no numbers it's just it is what it is that's what
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.880]   comes down to and so i but but the thing about hawkins was he really
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.480]   labeled it really quite well where he basically you know just kind of if you
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.000]   look at the different descriptions of of low level
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.400]   consciousness or what i would also call low level vibration
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:56.440]   uh that new and then as you kind of come from an environment
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.920]   and a mindset where you're living in this in in basically you know negative
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.040]   energy uh from whatever reason that you have
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.040]   and you're in a negative space to a very positive space and then to an
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.320]   enlightened space and that's the best way i kind of describe it
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.040]   and we've all gone through that i mean we've all
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.320]   there's nobody out there that hasn't experienced trauma
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.280]   hasn't experienced a bad day versus a good day
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.400]   and this is what that's all about and so
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.240]   the thing is and this is probably the most important thing
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.520]   uh if you know because so many people are getting into
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.880]   low level quantum tech and the quantum upgrade for physical reasons right
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.520]   specifically emf um you know and but the thing about it though there's this
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:45.480]   other huge huge piece to this stuff called quantum energy
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.080]   and frequency that's consciousness related
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:56.600]   and so i've spent the last three years really working on on myself
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.040]   to raise my level of consciousness raise my vibration
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.920]   and i can tell you that if you subscribe to the upgrade service and you're bathing
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.760]   yourself in quantum energy or you purchase the device
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.920]   and you're wearing the capsule or you have the block
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.840]   bottom line is if you if you seek to raise your consciousness
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.840]   it's not going to do it by itself okay bottom line
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:25.480]   it just doesn't happen what you have to do if you want to take advantage of
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.920]   this benefit is you have to interact with it
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.360]   and what i mean by interact with it interact with that energy
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.840]   because the one thing about these devices uh and this service right that
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.640]   that i i want to point out is that quantum energy is
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.080]   the energy of all reality it's it's everywhere it's the
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.240]   energy that that makes atoms move right and so
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.880]   we all live in the quantum field we technically if we could develop our
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.000]   consciousness to the point and this is where you get into the
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.720]   people who are literally buddha level consciousness
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.760]   they have that ability i mean you look at people
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.200]   who are like tai chi masters or qi kung masters
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.680]   right or you know really really really conscious
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:17.480]   level high people they have the ability to do this stuff that i'm talking about
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.000]   without any tools and that's just because they've spent
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.720]   years and decades of their life meditating and doing all that inner work
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:30.520]   to raise their being out of this basically this negativity
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.200]   into positivity and then into enlightenment
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.880]   which which is the whole definition of enlightenment actually
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.400]   and so you have to engage with it and what i mean by that is
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.440]   if you know you have to work on your own
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.040]   things that are holding you back from reaching higher consciousness
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:52.040]   and that's called inner work and so how i just want to share with you how i did
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.320]   that was i've been doing inner work for
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.320]   literally my whole life you know i mean i used to have a little sign in in my
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.360]   house it just said let it go uh because i'm
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.000]   i used to be here you know yeah i think i used to be
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.320]   one of those people that if i ran into a negative situation
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:14.040]   i couldn't let it go you know uh it'd be like i'd hold it in forever and ever
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.360]   and uh and you know and and uh yeah it was just
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.280]   and and i was after a lifetime of carrying all these grudges and and all
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.160]   these negative experiences around with me and
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:29.640]   and uh yeah it kind of built up to the point where it was really holding me down
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.320]   as an individual in enjoying my life and so
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:38.040]   i spent a couple of decades just trying to do that inner work you know meditating
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.640]   on all of this negativity and being able to process it
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.600]   but the thing about the tools right if you're a mere mortal like myself
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.360]   you kind of need a tool or tool is like you know these aquarium tools
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.520]   they're shortcuts uh in elevating your consciousness and getting over this
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.800]   trauma and stuff like that and what i have found personally
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:03.320]   is that if i engage with that energy and i use that amplification of energy
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.920]   to kind of then help me do my inner work and process
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.320]   through the trauma and the you know all that
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.760]   conflict and negativity um by doing that and then
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.680]   helping and having that energy and working with it i'm able to just
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.840]   release all that stuff and i can tell you i've never been in a better
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.160]   place in my life uh after three years of doing that with
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.920]   with the quantum tools that i have for the prior 20 years when i've been working
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.200]   on it by myself so like i said it's a shortcut
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:39.480]   so for those of you that want to um benefit from this aspect you know of
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:43.640]   quantum energy you need to i would suggest looking into doing that inner
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.320]   work looking into releasing trauma and then do it
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.240]   in the field okay uh do it when you're exposed to the
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.120]   energy and you'll find that it's gonna it's gonna happen a
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.160]   lot easier but again at the end of the day
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.560]   you have to engage with it you have to work with it for it to happen
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:06.920]   and then you know what it's so subtle that again you're
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.480]   you're not going to feel anything it's like come on do something
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.160]   but it's happening and it's happening at a very very deep level
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:19.320]   within your consciousness and how i realized that i've elevated myself
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:24.200]   is by looking back at time and realizing wow you know like let's say
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.160]   three years ago if x would have happened to me
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.240]   um i would have been just you know upset or i would have
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.720]   you know raised my voice or i would have you know kind of engaged
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.880]   in a negative way and then i'd be all you know let's say upset about it for a
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.640]   while and i but now uh things that happen to me
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.880]   it's kind of like water off a duck's back it's just it's
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.960]   i don't have that emotional reaction which is what this is all about this
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.640]   third-dimensional thinking uh you know i'm kind of i i would say
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.040]   i'm getting there you know maybe in the middle
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.800]   inner wisdom inner love i haven't maybe haven't got the inner but you know i'm
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.520]   getting there but the idea is there okay so
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:09.240]   engage with it uh the number four of the top five benefits
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:14.280]   of later quantum tech and the upgrade service is that you're being
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.600]   bathed in this energy and that energy is going to give it's going to amplify
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:23.720]   your own energy and it's going to and it's going to help you
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.040]   deal with all of this stuff but you have to deal with it all right
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.840]   enough said but you you can do this you have to engage with it
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.600]   and if you do it happens and so these tools
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.880]   are amazing because i look at myself now as compared to three years ago before i
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.200]   had this stuff and i literally am a much more
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.000]   calmer being um and and and i just i see the world
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.560]   in a different light than i used to see it and uh in the same stuff happens you
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.360]   know the same crap happens every day right to us
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.800]   whether it's somebody being an idiot in traffic or
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:06.360]   conflict with family you know and work you know but
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.880]   the way i react and the way that it affects me
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:14.520]   is so different and i'm so much happier with who i am today
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.680]   than i ever have been my life and so i just wanted to share that with you
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.680]   and i encourage you do that inner work and use
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.920]   these tools as your shortcut to give you that little boost of energy that you
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.440]   needed to get over that hump okay do that and you
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.280]   benefit from that now the fifth benefit is gifting
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.960]   positive and i'm sorry the fourth benefit i was on number three
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.600]   forgot the number them the fourth one is gifting positive energy now for those
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.880]   of you who are are you know are altruistic or
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:50.600]   philanthropic or you just love helping other people i'm one of those um you
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:54.120]   know this the amazing thing is you can help
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:58.760]   others if you know if that's your thing and so with the quantum upgrade
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:01.320]   the cool thing is is you could subscribe your friends and
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.520]   and just gift them that you know the the free trial let them give it a try for
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.480]   one or two weeks uh for free doesn't cost you anything or
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.000]   if you're you know if you really care about them and you want to
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.360]   uh and it's completely up to you uh you can you know you could subscribe to
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.440]   them under your bundle right you can add them to your bundle that's another
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:22.200]   you um and then you could send them that quantum energy and and
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:26.520]   if you've noticed there's a share feature on the quantum upgrade website
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.120]   where you could and i do this too with my daughter and future son-in-law i've
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.800]   signed them up as for myself under my bundle
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:39.960]   and i gave them both a u subscription in which uh with the share feature
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.520]   i just get their email and i can plug it into the quantum upgrade site and then
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:49.880]   i let them at which which lets them control all the settings so they can
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.240]   adjust their you know the amount of energy they get and their boosters and
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.720]   their frequency and so they've got all of the ability to do everything i can do
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:01.480]   except they don't see my stuff they just can only look at their own
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.520]   you know it's a subscription that i have in my bundle so
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:09.640]   i have a bundle and i set them up and i gave them control of their
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.080]   of their subscription but it doesn't affect you know they don't see what i'm
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.520]   doing and they can't change mine uh you know i don't worry about it but you
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.960]   know it's kind of a really nice feature to be able to share
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:23.640]   uh you know share the share the love right and so that's kind of what i have to do
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.800]   is i share um uh my my bundle with my family
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.080]   and and kind of just you know help to help them out as well i've also
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.760]   gifted them an infinity block and um and yeah it's
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.280]   it's really cool too because there's so much positive stuff going on in their
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.040]   lives right now um and uh i think it's helping
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.760]   the other thing too if you've been with quantum upgrade for an extra number of
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.160]   months i'm sorry you don't remember the number of months
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.240]   but after a certain point of time uh you automatically get a free field for
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.000]   home or location uh subscription it's just free and then you just
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.360]   plug in an address and so uh because i have a bundle
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.880]   a five or something i get five free field for home
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:04.520]   locations and so i've put my friends houses in
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:09.320]   those uh and so that i could not only gift my my daughter and future son-in-law
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.200]   each one of them are you i get these free home ones right so
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.240]   obviously one of them is my home and then the other ones are my my other
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:18.280]   friends homes so then i could you know basically
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.640]   gift them that you know the quantum energy
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:25.720]   uh you know to their to their house right and so i you know it's it's a
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.000]   wonderful aspect of it and i really think being able to
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.080]   gift positive energies and we try to imagine if we all did that right i'm
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.160]   can you imagine on how much better the world would be
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.280]   but you know but it's a little bit at a time right so that whole you know
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.400]   uh if you've ever heard the story about the kid on the beach with
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.560]   you know with a sand dollar right but anyway
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.440]   so that's one of the things with quantum upgrade you can do for
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.640]   gifting positive energy to the world and to other people and people you care
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.000]   about uh now for lela quantum tech uh the thing about
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.200]   lela quantum tech the devices man you can really do
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.280]   some pretty wild stuff um you can do with your blocks you can
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.640]   do you can take advantage of the concept of quantum entanglement
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.000]   and you can gift positive energy to anything and anyone any
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.600]   out there in the world uh simply by putting a picture of them
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.360]   uh in the block or again you can get a sample of them
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.320]   uh and it's you know actually quantum entanglement so
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.840]   so incredibly wild that you could literally just write their name
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.680]   on a piece of paper and put that in your block but you can send energy using
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.400]   your blocks and also too the other thing about
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.560]   having the physical devices especially uh if you had a capsule you can
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.160]   you can make foils but more more specifically if you had a
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:39.160]   block you can make all of your own stuff
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.000]   so and and i have done this as well extensively i've made lots and lots of
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.440]   videos about how to make stuff with your blocks
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:52.120]   and so you know i have made capsules um i've charged water bottles for people
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.320]   i you know just all sorts of stuff and just gift it all the way
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.920]   uh you know and and just it's all about gifting right and so i've gifted people
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.760]   charged water bottles and you name it and then one of the other things that i do
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.200]   just to kind of uh share and this is something i've mentioned in the telegram
[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.880]   check group but i have this little weird quirk where
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.080]   every time you know we were all the same about you know loose change right if you
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.320]   go out and spend cash you get all this loose change
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:19.240]   and it ends up in a jar in a box or something and then when it gets too much
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.680]   you take it to the bank or you dump it in a coin machine at the grocery store and
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.440]   you know that sort of thing uh but you know what i do before
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:31.080]   before i release all that coins into the wild i'll charge them
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:35.000]   and i'll and i'll and then i'll copy like the inner piece frequency to it
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.360]   or i'll copy heal into it or or happiness
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:43.080]   and i i just will charge all these coins and then release them into the wild
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.000]   and and it's funny because you know i've been doing that for three years
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.200]   and i'm just i always often wonder like how many people are walking around with
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.080]   a quarter or a loose change in their pocket
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.080]   that's literally a positive energy quantum you know device
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:00.520]   and they don't even know it but i'm spreading all that energy out into the
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:05.320]   society by simply charging your change and and i encourage everybody to do that
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.520]   i'm seeding the world with positive energy
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.920]   but i think it's a it's a great idea and and so you know go for it
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.200]   but that's how you can then gift positive energy these are some of the benefits
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.720]   there so that's number four you can gift
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.640]   right with you know a lot of times when you buy other products you can't gift
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.720]   them but this one is all designed to share
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:32.600]   okay now manifesting intent number five and this is a
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:37.880]   really incredible benefit and it's one that i'm still working on trying to get
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:42.360]   better at but the thing about manifesting and i want to say thank you to the
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.720]   wonderful person that posted this picture most recently
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:50.120]   in our telegram chat group showing how she's manifesting intent so let me
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:55.240]   read your read you what her intent her intention is and she has this little
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:59.560]   just piece of paper where she wrote down what she wants to manifest in her
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.360]   life and this is how you do it with if you have a block
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.000]   and i'll tell you how to do it with that upgrade this thing
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.680]   but it's basically this is what her manifestation is and i think it's
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:11.000]   beautiful by the way if you see this video
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.280]   a big mahalo for sharing this it's her manifestation is
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:21.320]   in all that i am in all that i desire and in all that i do
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:25.720]   i always allow the best possible outcomes to enhance my life
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:30.200]   for this i am and will be forever grateful
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:34.200]   thank you and that's her manifestation and that's so
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:39.160]   beautiful and so that's how you can manifest intent
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:44.120]   now there are a cobbillion different videos
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:48.200]   on tiktok and instagram and youtube with real
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:52.760]   really incredible spiritual people and thought leaders
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.320]   you know discussing how to manifest intent so i won't tell you
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:03.320]   how to do it but how to use quantum tech or quantum upgrade
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:07.240]   is how you know this is how that that in relation to that so
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:11.320]   if you want to manifest intent with a capsule just write it down
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.280]   put it in your capsule between the between the
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.320]   the spheres and the outer in the outer inner shell
[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:20.280]   of the capsule right you want the energy to go through
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.400]   the paper and that broadcast here in ten
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.760]   if you have a block just do it exactly like this lady has done
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.640]   and now if you have upgrade this is where it gets
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:35.720]   really interesting because if the higher in vibration you get
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.480]   okay the higher in vibration you get and you start coming out of this lower
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.480]   level thinking and you start getting into higher
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:45.160]   consciousness the better your ability so that when that
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.840]   energy is enveloping you the stronger your ability
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:52.280]   is to manifest intent into the quantum field because you
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:57.240]   remember now quantum energy you're we all live in the quantum field we all
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:00.680]   have the ability to manifest without tools
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:06.680]   okay however when you are in the field of quantum energy whether it's a
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.200]   subscription or a device that field is
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:15.160]   amplifying the quantum energy around you and so right off the bat you can
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:21.560]   manifest much better in the field you know in
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:25.160]   the amplified field and you would have just by yourself so
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.120]   the way i would recommend if you have the quantum upgrade and you want to
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.920]   manifest i'd go into a meditative state
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.440]   and then manifest through that while you're being boosted
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:38.520]   okay and that's what i would recommend if you have the upgrade service
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:42.280]   and you want to manifest intent the best way i can think of doing
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.440]   is get into a meditative state time it with a booster
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.640]   and then manifest and you're going to find out that that's going to be a
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.840]   pretty cool way to do it of course again if you have a
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:57.000]   block it's sort of a shortcut and you can just put the intent in there and you
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.680]   don't have to get that deep into it but that's how it is you know and then the
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.600]   last thing i kind of want to share about manifesting intent
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:09.080]   because you know for three years i've been reading every post in the chat group
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:13.880]   and it's i just want to say that it's not about what you want
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.880]   it's about who you are and what i mean by that
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:23.960]   is when it comes to manifesting intent it's all about
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:31.160]   aligning to your true self okay so it's not a wish device it's
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:34.120]   you know in the world of bioelectrical
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.680]   magnetics there's this thing called radionics
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.200]   and they call their little devices the wish machines and stuff like that
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.800]   and they're in it's based on the concept of manifesting intent but
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:48.520]   i hate that i just really hate this grinds me wrong i think that
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:52.520]   it's not about wishing you know it's about it's about
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.800]   elevating yourself and aligning yourself
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.240]   to what i would call your divine plan or your truth
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:03.560]   you know what is your path and i'll tell you when you manifest
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:08.040]   in alignment with your own path and your own truth
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:11.480]   and then especially for if you're trying to help somebody else
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:16.360]   what is their truth what is their path you know because some people
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.400]   don't want to be helped you've met them you know them you know
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:23.480]   mostly our parents we can't get through to them
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.880]   they don't want to help themselves right kind of thing
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:31.400]   or toddlers for teenagers you know and and so you know what's you know like
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:35.960]   what's their path and i'll tell you if you try to manifest intent
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.000]   to someone who is just not going to go you know not
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.920]   there's just no way it's you know you're you're basically
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.320]   um you're not gonna it's not gonna nothing's gonna happen
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.280]   it's just nothing's gonna happen because they're not involved
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:52.040]   in the process or their own divine plan doesn't have that
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:56.440]   you know out for them or if you're trying to manifest winning the lotto
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:00.120]   and if that's not part of your experience on earth it's not part of
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.640]   who your truth is and what you're supposed to do because we know
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:08.120]   why are you here what are you supposed to do what's your purpose who are you
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:11.320]   you know what those are really important questions
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:15.080]   and and is what you're asking for aligns with that
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:18.760]   that's the point that's the point about i'm trying to make it's not about what you
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.480]   want it's about who you are it's about
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:26.920]   your truth you know your divine plan and the one thing i've discovered is that
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:31.800]   when i manifest or when i try to manifest intent
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.400]   um i'll give you a good example there's uh
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.600]   we have this really wonderful veterinarian who's in our telegram chat group
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.400]   and um he every now and then we'll post a picture of an animal that
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.320]   needs energy that needs you know needs something needs a little boost from us
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:51.240]   from the community and there was this one dog that was literally
[00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.920]   at death's door and the thing was it was like you know
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:42:00.360]   the dog was at death's door and it was going to pass and that was what it's
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.720]   that's that's you know that's its life cycle that's its divine plan
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:07.480]   it was its time it was it's time to pass
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.000]   however what was really interesting is that there was a few of us that jumped in
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.080]   and put the dog's picture in our blocks and the manifestation of intent that i
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:19.560]   had for the dog was to in knowing you know
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:23.400]   knowing that it was you know the story like 17 years old or something
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:27.400]   you know i knew that it was i just knew and i just knew in my heart maybe
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.440]   and you know i'm just want to maybe i'm up here already
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:34.280]   you know in the middle here and but i could feel it i could feel in my heart
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.960]   that this was time for the dog to go from you know just from engaging about it
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:42.360]   and so you know some other folks would put in there that all the hope it gets
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.320]   well you know and it's all beautiful stuff guys don't get me wrong
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:51.640]   but when i when i kind of you know kind of meditated on what was going on
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.680]   the intention that i had put into block for this little dog
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:43:01.960]   was to transition you know to pass into your journey
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.960]   within your divine plan with the greatest of peace and love
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.000]   that you could ever you know experience
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.720]   and that was what i had put into the block and what was really interesting
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:19.400]   was a few days later the dog had perked up just for a little while
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:24.120]   and then passed and then the description of what had happened
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:28.840]   you know of the story was that where the owners were
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:33.320]   just devastated you know that their that their beloved animal was passing
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:37.080]   and that the dog was kind of distressed you know
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:43.640]   in distress but then you know when it finally came time for the dog to pass
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.400]   the owners were at peace and the dog was at peace
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.640]   and his transition into his next you know
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:55.880]   whatever he's gonna be uh you know his reincarnation or when he
[00:43:55.880 --> 00:44:00.440]   made that transition along his his journey his truth his plan
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:05.080]   it went peacefully and it went with all the love
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:08.680]   that you could ever share you know with this situation
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.800]   and to hear that was just amazing to me
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.560]   and that was because i felt that that was what was best
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.920]   alignment for his path and that's my story
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:24.440]   and um it's a beautiful thing so when you manifest just remember it's not about
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:29.480]   wanting stuff okay um it's about you know who you are and who they are
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.200]   that you're trying to help okay enough about that
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.880]   but hey you know i just want to say thank you so much for watching this video
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.480]   i hope this was helpful for you and i hope that you can
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.920]   kind of you know just get the the most you can
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:47.560]   out of this investment that you've made in Leila quantum tech
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:50.040]   and the upgrade service it's an investment
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.600]   into your well-being in your health and it's it's an amazing thing that you've
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.760]   done for yourself and i don't find it as any
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.040]   can you know coincidence that you ran across this stuff
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.760]   you know like one day oh i'm just listening to a podcast all of a sudden
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.520]   hey wow that phillip guys that's pretty interesting stuff i want to you know
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.000]   impulse buy something and then you're sitting there going
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.520]   hey man you know oh what's it going to do
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:18.520]   right but your divine path or your path led you to this
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:23.000]   discovering this stuff and i want to try to help you get the most you can out of
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.080]   it so there's five benefits one last time
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.160]   heal
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.000]   send energy raise your consciousness work with that energy
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.560]   you know gift as much as you can gift and manifest wonderful things
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:42.360]   for those around you and uh and it's it all it just gets better
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.400]   honestly i i'm into it for three years now
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:49.320]   and it just gets better so those are those benefits
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.280]   you know have at it and have some fun with it
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:57.640]   spread the love and thank you for your time watching this video
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.920]   mahalo i'm from oi that's why i speak that and most of all
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:08.200]   namaste everybody have a great day aloha
