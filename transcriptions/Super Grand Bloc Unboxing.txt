[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy short.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:17.000]   It's an unboxing of the super grand block that I got from Lillelle, Quantum Tech, for that frequency contest on the sleep and rest frequency.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:28.500]   So I think this is pretty special because we just got noticed a couple of days ago from Philip that the super grand block has actually been redone
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.500]   and it's going to be round instead of square.
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.500]   So I got a square one so I think there's only a few of these prototypes made and I know that there's four of us at one of them in contests
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.500]   and who knows how many more they made but I think these are the only square ones there are.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.500]   So going forward you kind of just take a look how big this thing is.
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.500]   This is going to be round and so now if you open the box there's going to be the rod.
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.500]   I'm guessing that the round one is probably going to have four rods just like the square one.
[00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.500]   You get the rods, you get the nuts, it's going to be round and then of course it comes with the little booklet.
[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.500]   It says congratulations on buying your stuff and it's got the little table there but you can see where it says these are the different blocks
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500]   and it doesn't mention the super grand block.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:33.500]   Well to sit down and fill up and get the charging copying times for this new block, what Philip did announce a couple of days ago?
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.500]   What's that? I'm going to get this out of here, here's one of the plates right there so take that out.
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.500]   This is what the unboxing looks like.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500]   I know you're all curious right because I'm always curious about unboxing.
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.500]   It's like what do you get in a box? What does it look like when you get it? Anyway it's really big and it's heavy.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:03.500]   So there's the two plates that put the box away for now so I've basically got the two different plates and the rods and the screws.
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.500]   So I'm going to go ahead and put the thing together.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   But this is what's been described so far for the super grand block which is it's going to be round.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.500]   Okay Rod screws the whole bit, we don't know what the charging times are we'll get to figure that out.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:28.500]   But once this is assembled it's going to look like that over there which is my other grand block but that's a regular grand block.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   This guy's super, the strength of this block, the super grand block is supposed to be according to Philip's post on the Hawking scale 5600.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   Yes that's 5600 it's literally the strongest block ever way more powerful than the new infinity block.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:58.500]   And you know it's kind of brand new to the market so we're really, nobody knows what that level of the Hawkins is going to do.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.500]   It's pretty amazing. The other features obviously are these things have the harmony, the harmonizing feature and so forth.
[00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:20.500]   So it's got all the regular features but there's one extra feature that Philip mentioned is that this block is infused with some energy that reduces the energetic properties of deuterium.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:39.500]   So if you're familiar with that there's a biohacking thing called deuterium depleted water based on the science that people who live in areas of the planet that have the least amount of deuterium which is hydrogen isotope live longer because the
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   higher and the science has shown that the higher you have deuterium in your body you know the shorter you live so the lower is good right the longer.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:59.500]   The lower it is the longer you live people that live in areas with really low deuterium in the water have the highest longevity on the planet so that's how deuterium became a biohacking thing.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   And this super block not only will it do everything that the grand block can do and the infinity block as well travel block but it also has this unique feature where it'll do lower or I guess the best way to say it is it's going to lower the deuterium in your body from an energetic standpoint.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:30.500]   So again you know it's kind of like the food intolerance thing where you know you can take any type of food and you measure it every possible way you can measure it and it's the food right.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   But then if you put it in a block it still is this you know you can measure it again it's still the food but it's been changed its quantum potential has been changed and now it's no longer triggering allergies and negative reactions.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:05:07.500]   So that's going to be the same thing here if you put anything inside this block that's water or a being a living being living thing plants trees people you us you know pets then it's going to lower the deuterium you know signature the energy of the deuterium in your body so that's really really cool it's a that's a big biohacking thing and it's it's amazing.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:33.500]   So my plans for this guy now I showed you that guy that's my kitchen block grand block I put all the food and groceries water everything in that and this guy is going to go in my bedroom I thought the interesting tank to do with this is put myself in it myself and my dog so I'm going to set it up on either side of my bed and sleep in it and see what happens it's going to be quite an interesting
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:06:02.500]   tinker for the standpoint that it's literally twice as strong as you know it's just super super strong but you know we're mostly water right I mean human beings are mostly water and if this thing will lower the deuterium in my body and also positively charged the body you know the structure of the water in my body then it should be quite an interesting health hack as well as a biohacking to actually put my body
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:31.500]   in it and especially sleep in it so I'm going to give that a try and I'll report later how that worked out but yeah there we are so today is December 4th I received this yesterday I'm really excited about the super grand block now the actual round one that's going to be released to the public from what Philip says is going to become available in January so there you go so anyway that's that's the super grand block unblocked unboxing and my crazy tinker idea
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.940]   So hey, let's see what happens while we're porting.
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:34.960]   Let you know.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.500]   Aloha.
