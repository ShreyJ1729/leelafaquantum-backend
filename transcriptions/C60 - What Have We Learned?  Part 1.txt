[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me, Kay Elmer and in
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.280]   this video I'd like to share with you some research on what we have learned
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.840]   about carbon 60 since it became popular as a health supplement three years ago.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.460]   If anyone who's taking C60 today I hope you still remember that you're part of a
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.240]   human trial and there have been no published human studies. So come along
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.000]   with me and let's go through some of the research. Obviously before we can jump in
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.100]   we need to talk about some disclaimers. This material is for research purposes
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.980]   only. C60 is not approved for consumption by the FDA. You understand that consuming
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.320]   C60 is still experimental and you do so at your own risk. I don't have any steak
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.120]   in any C60 company or C60 product and I do not get paid for making C60 videos.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.860]   Now I do want to make a note on source materials for this video. Normally if
[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.420]   you look at the video description you'll see all of the links. I try to be very
[00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.800]   thorough, extremely transparent, share everything that I'm reading so that you
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.180]   can judge for yourself. However there's so many studies in this video. What I've
[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.740]   done is I basically have put them all in a Google directory and I've given you a
[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.740]   link to the directories so you can just go ahead and look for them yourself. So
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.620]   it's I'm not gonna list them all out. They're just right there in the directory.
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.380]   So you know knock yourselves out. Oh I also did find a find a way to obtain
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.460]   the full study and not just the abstract so all of the material is there and it's
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.320]   all in that directory for you. So let's get started. Before you can talk about
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.920]   what we have learned I just want to do a brief history of C60. So they're all on
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.880]   the same pages as to where we're at. So for those of you who don't know and this
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.080]   is kind of an interesting history C60 was discovered in 1985 by a research
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.000]   team headed by a gentleman by the name of Harold Croto James Heath and Richard
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.160]   Smalley. They discovered it. They were working in Rice University and then 10
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.420]   years later much to everyone's surprise and this is a very short time period for
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.420]   a Nobel Peace Prize in chemistry they were awarded the prize because it was
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.180]   such a monumental find to actually discover this unique molecule C60. Now
[00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.540]   in that time period I want to point out here something that was really important
[00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.580]   is that just shortly after the discovery there was the SES research was founded
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.940]   by Chris Burris and Robert Wong in which they started to you know produce C60 on
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.540]   mass. In the original days back in these days C60 was produced in the lab at
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.280]   extremely high cost it was selling for like six thousand dollars a gram. So when
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.440]   SES was founded they decided to make it in you know mass produce it and then it
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.000]   became and then they started feeding it to all the academia for studies as well
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.400]   as for commercial use. So the actual production commercial production of C60
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.280]   started with the founding of SES in 1991 a US company so that's when C60
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.080]   actually started getting used it purely for commercial use as a industrial
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.720]   lubricant. So then in 2003 a company in Japan called vitamin C60 had started to
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.640]   look at some of the research that had been done since the discovery and they
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.040]   discovered that the ROS sponge activity of C60 was was valuable for
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.960]   cosmetic use and what ROS stands for is reactive oxygen species or free
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.120]   radicals so because C60 has that very unique property in which it can
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.960]   basically sponge up free radicals they decided and to create a firm called
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.240]   vitamin C60 and in 2003 launched and started selling C60 their own product
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.560]   that you could that cosmetic companies were putting in as an ingredient to their
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.040]   products a lot of you who use makeup and and that sort of product in a beauty
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.440]   products cosmetics you may not know but you've probably been using products we
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.000]   C60 in it for a very long time and so that's kind of what started there was
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.720]   the cosmetic use of C60 started in 2003 and then came 2012. 2012 was a very
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.600]   remarkable year in the history of C60 because that was when the famous quote
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.760]   rat study was was published now it had actually started about three to five
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.920]   years earlier and it was commissioned in the University of Paris and the actual
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.960]   study itself was a LD50 study and LD is lethal dose 50 meaning that it's a study
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.480]   to find out because there was people using it commercially people using it
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.000]   cosmetically so there was lots of workers processing it and so you know
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.480]   from an OSHA standpoint you know they wanted to know hey you know how much of
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.840]   this stuff is toxic or and you know in terms of people working with it and
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.840]   using it in industry so they did an LD50 study in Paris and they published the
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.560]   results in 2012 and this is what really started the interest in C60 from a health
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.600]   supplement use because this study was about trying to you know find out how
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.520]   many rats die if you give them too much C60 and what happened was as you might
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.360]   know is the rats didn't die they flourished and they lived 92% longer than
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.320]   the control group of rats not given it which means basically their life was
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.920]   extended by by two times and then additionally to that you know when they
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.760]   actually dissected these rats after the many years of the study they discovered
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.640]   that they had absolutely no tumors whereas the control group had lots of
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.920]   different health problems and so forth you know dying of old age but when they
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.680]   dissected these rats when they finally passed away and they actually had to
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.200]   eliminate a few at the end just to wrap up the study these rats their organs
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.800]   were in pristine condition so that was a pretty amazing study so when that study
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.360]   came out then down here three months literally three months later carbon
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.040]   60 olive oil company was founded by Tom Martin and he was the first individual
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.360]   to actually put C60 as a health supplement onto the market and so in
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.600]   this time period right here was quite an amazing boom in terms of just the
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.880]   discovery it was it was quite controversial at at its time it still is
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.520]   and so what Tom Martin founded this company and within three months he was
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.600]   producing C60 in olive oil to the exact specifications that the scientists had
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.120]   done it in Paris and so then he started producing it and then from there has
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:23.960]   been a huge small army of people who have decided to create C60 in oil products
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.600]   for the health supplement use now right after that in the same time period in
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.320]   the 2012 there was a longevity forum and there's it's kind of like a
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.960]   biohacker forum and then and the people in this forum jumped on to the idea of
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.360]   C60 in oil because of this study and started making their own they started
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.480]   buying from Tom and and several others you know several meaning like a handful
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.600]   of other folks that were really one of the you know the groundbreakers in
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.240]   creating this product for health use and the longevity biohackers were the first
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.520]   group of people to actually the early early adopters of C60 olive oil and they
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.200]   were at it for like several years before the forum kind of just has you know it's
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.160]   still out there but it's very dead I mean you go check it and you know there's
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.640]   like a post every couple of weeks or something so you know it you know it was
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.840]   at its peak there they did a lot of different you know personal you know
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.280]   testimonies and everyone is trying it that's where I got the idea for you know
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.140]   using a jar to make C60 oil so in this forum it's kind of like the original
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.240]   archive of the original group of people that started taking C60 oil for their
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.840]   health and so it this is where it started and then in 2017 that's when it
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.600]   really took off but I want to point out one thing in between was that in 2015
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.520]   scientists had discovered C60 in outer space they discovered that C60 is
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.640]   essentially a very common component of stellar dust or what you would call
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.440]   you know cosmic dust and and it's really remarkable that in this same little
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.800]   time period here not only did they discover that there was incredible
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.760]   health benefits of C60 but also at the same time it discovered that it was not
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:10.080]   just a you know just off you know it's an odd or very rare come you know
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.560]   substance or carbon alatrophe on planet earth but it was actually found
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.680]   throughout the universe so this is a very very important step in the history of
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.080]   C60 was in 2015 and it was discovered and proven that it existed in space and
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.120]   it was actually spaces full of C60 so now going back to 2017 I call it the
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:36.560]   old guy old guy goes on to Sarah Westall YouTube and he basically shares this
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.000]   study of the rat study this individual had about a 60,000 person following and a
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.400]   lot of those people were really really perked interest when they heard the
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.240]   story of the rat study and so that's when it started that group of people
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.640]   following the old guy on the Sarah Westall show really started you know they
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.800]   basically and if you if for those of you who are there at that moment I was
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:05.720]   listening to that video right when it came out within 24 hours the followers
[00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.720]   of this person basically bought out the entire market every single producer of
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.120]   C60 oil was bought out that's how small the market was within a couple of days
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.080]   and so that started the basically the bull run on C60 as health supplement so
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:26.040]   now what happened since then it's 2020 and it's three years later so that's what
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.280]   this video is for let's talk about some of the research and so down here of
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.360]   course that's the rest of us joined in so you're here now it's 2020 C60 is
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.560]   still used commercially as an industrial lubricant it's still using
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.560]   cosmetics and it's been three years since it really got popular way in the
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.960]   help supplement industry so let's talk about the very first thing that's so
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:51.760]   important about all of this is that the reason they did this the C60 study in
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.800]   Paris was to find out again how many you know how much C60 doesn't take to kill
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.520]   you and they discovered it doesn't kill you they couldn't kill the rats with it
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.040]   and that was the study called the prolongation of lifespan of rats by
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.360]   repeated oral administration of C60 fullerene this is the pivotal study that
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.200]   started at all and what's so important about the idea of C60 being toxic is that
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.440]   one study does not define anything one study is like you know it's basically
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.240]   like a scout ant it just it finds something out there in the in the universe
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.360]   that you want to take a harder look at and if you cannot duplicate a study in it
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.960]   then the results are inconclusive and you can't you can't validate them and so
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:38.000]   forth so what's really important about the last three years is has the idea or
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.040]   the discovery or and the results of that original 2012 study has it been
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.280]   validated is C60 truly toxic or not and so I want to point out that there's been
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.200]   several other studies that have been done that have proven it is not toxic and
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.560]   I think that's the most important thing that I could share with you today in
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.000]   terms of what have we learned in the last three years is that C60 is not
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.960]   toxic now a Japanese scientist team actually did a another study they used
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.280]   mice and they put C60 in corn oil and that study is called the subacute oral
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.960]   toxicity study with fullerene C60 in rats I'm sorry these rats and they found
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.720]   there was no toxicity as well and that's happened in the last three years and
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.320]   then again you then you've got the live pet which is a spearheaded commercial
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.120]   team by a gentleman called Ian Mitchell and they sell a product called
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.560]   companion C60 for pets and they started their market for with a pet product and
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.560]   they went looking at C60 from a and they have a full-on commercial lab these
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.600]   are not entrepreneurial these guys are you know laboratory folks and they work
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.080]   with the universities and so Ian Mitchell and his team decided they wanted
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:50.160]   to produce a product for pets using C60 and and the you know the products
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.880]   called live pet and so what they did was they actually did a study as they
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.800]   called it it's the general they call it the general properties of C60 and their
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:03.280]   safety assessment in animals and what they did in that study was they administered
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.560]   C60 in oil to 15 dogs over a long period of time so not you know they took it
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.320]   from rats to know they're using dogs and they did this study and then they had
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.800]   the dogs assessed not you know not dissected or anything like that but they
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.000]   had the dogs fully assessed they tested the urine they tested all these blood
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.640]   samples and everything and discovered that there was absolutely no detriments
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.440]   to any of their bodily functions or anything about the dogs and all 15 dogs
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.560]   thrived and so this was another study showing that he C60 did not have any
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.840]   toxic results in mammals and then lastly what's really kind of the most
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.520]   important I think when you talk about you know validation of the body study
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.800]   which is what the rat studies called is that live pet under Ian Mitchell he
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.040]   actually also did an LD50 study in using p53 knockout rats instead of
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:57.400]   wester wester rats and so the French use a certain kind of lab rat and the only
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.760]   difference that Ian had done when he did his study on rats was he just used a
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:07.680]   different type of lab rat a certified lab rat and and the lab rats you know are
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.520]   basically genetically disposed to die in two years and and develop cancer and
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.240]   die off okay that's what the rats he used and so he did a full-on laboratory
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.520]   study of these p53 knockout rats giving them C60 exactly like the body study the
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:28.000]   rat study and they all flourished as well and so his study and he's come out and
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.600]   this is the only problem he's he didn't publish his studies because he's a
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.280]   commercial guy he's not an academic and so he didn't publish his study but he
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.680]   talks a lot about his study and I and Mitchell's by far one of the foremost
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:43.320]   experts and and and and just professionals in the industry when it comes
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:49.000]   to C60 everyone I know really respects iron and so he talks about his study in
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.880]   several of his interviews in which he basically comes out and says that his
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:14:01.720]   results were within a 97% variance or a match okay to the body results I mean in
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.360]   other words the his study came out with the same exact conclusion with an error
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:12.080]   rate of 3% so he proved it to himself and then he launched his product in terms
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:18.040]   of is C60 toxic can see 60 help in terms of radical oxygen species scavenger
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:23.760]   slash sponge so this is what's really important here is the idea that C60 is
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.800]   not toxic and there's been other studies since then that have shown and proven
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.160]   that okay so what's also interesting in the last three years is that there's been
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.040]   other individuals and here's one of the videos that just came out in July 23rd
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.280]   this year of you know there's it what this is what I really like about 60 and
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:45.040]   I'm very tuck you know I'm very tied into the C60 you know I look at all the
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.440]   you know studies I watch every video that comes out about it it's just one of my
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.920]   interests and so there's more and more third-party folks that have nothing to
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.960]   do with C60 and they just review it because it's just something they look
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:00.400]   at as part of their YouTube channel and so this dr. Brad Stanfield recently came
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.600]   out with a video where he evaluated C60 independently and he came and he
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.560]   basically came out and said hey yeah that's got some positive benefits but he
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.480]   identified some potential risk and I really welcome third-party other other
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:14.920]   third parties taking a look at C60 because they look at it with a different
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.880]   set of eyes because they're not involved in C60 at all and so but I want to point
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.720]   out that there are potential risks and he did find potential risks and so let's
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.740]   talk about those potential risks because it's part of what we have learned in the
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.800]   last three years so that one of the things that he pointed out and this is
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.520]   what's very specific in his video you know we'll get into the benefits later
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.120]   but talk about the potential risk because you know we are the human trial if
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.280]   you're taking it you're part of the human trial there's been no human study
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:45.320]   done there's supposedly some studies being done now but it takes a long time
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:50.200]   because humans don't live like two years right and so the idea is that it's so
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.760]   important to take a look at at what other people are doing in terms of you
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.440]   know how they view things and so here's his thoughts on the potential risks and
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.840]   so this is what he pointed out in his assessment words that you know he
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.080]   basically said hey there's a potential for DNA damage and and that was a study
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.600]   based on water it was water-soluble C60 that they tested on flies and he
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:16.000]   also said that I was I was C60 can turn into an oxidant versus an antioxidant now
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.680]   antioxidants are good for you some oxidants are also good for you but
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.640]   mostly not good for you okay and when it's exposed to light now on that point
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:31.200]   alone C60 we've known since beginning that C60 you know we everybody that uses
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:38.640]   C60 or cell C60 they tell you keep it dark that's why C60 and it always is
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.440]   sold in a bottle that's dark and and if you make your own C60 you're always told
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.600]   you know stir in the dark keep the thing dark keep it out of keep it away from
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.600]   air but so I'm not really gonna go into the whole oxidant issue when exposed to
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.000]   light because that's been so proven that I just doesn't need to be repeated more
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   than a bunch of times right it's already been it's so proven that it's not even
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.120]   an issue yeah don't expose it to light and you're fine but the whole issue about
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.320]   the DNA damage well we'll chat that about that in a second and then he also
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:11.280]   mentions that there's solvents and in fact to quote dr. Stanfield in his video
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.000]   he says that hey you've got no idea these are the potential risk no idea that
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.360]   carbon 60 has actually you know how actually you know how the carbon 60 has
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.120]   actually been produced you don't know what form it's in and whether or not
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.160]   there's any leftover solvents and that's true so let's talk about that because
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.940]   you know he brings out a very important point of what we have learned so you
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.720]   know one of the things about solvents and I want to point this out and I did a
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.600]   full video on this if you want to go look at it in terms of solvents I did a
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.880]   full video on this where I pointed out two separate studies and went through
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.840]   the the manufacturing process of 60 so people could understand you know how
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.080]   this could possibly happen but in these two studies here with the first study
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.240]   solvent molecules in C60 they discovered that the evolution of from the
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.520]   material of species produced by solvents can be seen at temperature definitely
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.000]   higher than the one used in the usual removal and kneeling showing that this
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.120]   is not enough to produce solvent free fullerenes and what that study means is
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.760]   that most C60 is there's a you know there's multi-step process in the very
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.720]   last process before they'll sell it to you or put it into oil is that they
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:18.200]   vacuum bake it for 24 hours and around 400 degrees C60 actually will
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:25.240]   sublimator or turn into you know a gas it's 600 degrees Celsius but at 400
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.680]   degrees Celsius you know that's what they bake it at and they basically will
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:35.360]   bake it for so long that supposedly you know the the solvents that they use to
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:40.360]   process it to separate it out from other fullerenes is supposedly going to be
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:44.680]   removed okay but this study found that it doesn't it doesn't get removed that
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:50.600]   they're still going to be solvents left in the C60 trapped in the C60 crystals
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.760]   okay this other study called evolution of species during thermal sublimation of
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.600]   C60 found that the solvent molecules were found to be absorbed at interfaces of
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.680]   the micro crystals of C60 which is what I just said and centering of the micro
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.160]   crystals on heating is assumed to be responsible for entrapping some of the
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.760]   solvent molecules in the sample this may explain the difficulty removal of the
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.480]   solvents from fullerenes samples so what they found was that when you
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.800]   actually put it in the oven to get rid of the solvents right you create the
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:23.360]   little you trap the the molecules of solvents within the molecule crystals
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.240]   or clumps of C60 crystals and so that in other words these two studies said
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:33.000]   hey no matter if you bake it or not or I'm sorry if you bake it it will still
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.240]   have solvents remaining and so now you'll you'll notice that there are some C60
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.200]   companies out there there's a very few of them but they're actually taking because
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:48.320]   of this discovery they're taking the C60 oven baking it multiple times and then
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:53.680]   testing it to make sure and pulverizing it to break up those crystals then
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.960]   testing it and baking it you know I'm not sure exactly what they're doing because
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.120]   no one will share their you know share their secrets but they have to be
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.920]   multiply baking it pulverizing it and then of course they test it before they
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:11.080]   use it and they test to make sure that it is free of solvents down to a acceptable
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:16.080]   level of parts per billion so and then they call that so you know solvent free
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:20.160]   which is I you know it will get that's another subject but whether or not it's
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.920]   truly solvent free and so forth but there are companies out there that are
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.120]   actually taking multiple extra steps which does drive up their price because
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.520]   it's a lot of extra work but they're going out of their way now to go far
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:37.000]   beyond what the you know what's the C60 production methodology is prior to
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.480]   this other folks if you know are not unless they're you know and it's something
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.880]   that if you if you can tell if they're bragging about it okay this is simple as
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:50.120]   that but the bottom line about solvents is that C60 is not solvent free unless
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:55.360]   you go through all of that extra process or you buy a version of the C60 that
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.240]   never touched solvents to begin with called sublimated C60 all right enough
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.520]   about that the whole video I made two whole videos about this and I'll just
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.120]   you know jump on to the next subject so let's talk about the DNA damage claimed
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:11.520]   by Dr. Branfield okay two studies on that I went looking first of all I
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.840]   looked at the study that he claimed you know that he mentioned and his study
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.160]   basically is reconciling the controversial data on the effects of C60
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:24.480]   fullerene at the orgasimal organismal sorry and molecular levels using as a
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.160]   model of durosphelium lango-gaster okay it's a fly all right and they've
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.640]   discovered that the water soluble pristine C60 C60 fullerene at the
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.860]   concentration of 20 you know I forgot what that one and 40 millimeter per
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:44.680]   liters leads to the activation of the gene in D the fly larva is salivate
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.480]   celebratory a salivatory glands in which can indicate higher levels of DNA
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:56.440]   damage so what they put C60 in water and they gave it to some fly larva and the
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.960]   fly larva developed DNA damage okay now another one that I went out looking for
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:07.240]   anatina a study called genotoxicility of colloidal fullerene C60 this other
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:14.480]   study also basically backed up this one that C60 will cause DNA damage and they
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.280]   discovered that our data suggests that aqua C60 has DNA damage potential and
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:24.240]   that DNA damage is not due to covalent DNA had junked formation by C60 itself
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:30.200]   so what's really important about this is it's C60 in water C60 is not water
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:37.920]   soluble are you taking water soluble C60 no you're taking C60 lipollerene C60
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:43.520]   IE dissolved in oil so when anyone's talking about DNA damage there has I
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:49.640]   have not found and I went looking for hours to find any study that was C60 in
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:56.080]   oil slash DNA damage I could not find them it the damage of DNA claims for C60
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:02.320]   are aqua or water soluble C60 and that is not what we are doing in terms of the
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:07.520]   health supplement of C60 so this claim doesn't hold up against you know but it's
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.160]   what we learned right but it does not hold up you know as something that the
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:17.560]   health supplement industry should be worried about because we're not doing it
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.600]   that way it's very important that everyone understand you know how they
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:27.520]   were doing it versus how we are doing it IE taking C60 so the other thing that's
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.680]   so important and I want to make this point really strong and I just you know
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.480]   I want to reiterate what I just said I went looking for you know it's funny
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:40.200]   right scientists do studies and produce studies right and then there's other
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.120]   scientists who do reviews of other scientists studies you know it's kind of
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:49.600]   like this big circle right and so there's studies out there about C60 studies
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.680]   right and so I went and looked for those and said hey you know what do you guys
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.320]   think about you know all of these discrepancies where you know I got DNA
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.240]   damage by water soluble and you know blah blah blah and so here you go here's
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.920]   two different studies I found one's called the comparative toxicity of C60
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.640]   aggregates towards mammalian cell roles of the and I'm not trying to pronounce
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:11.560]   this word decomposition so what they've discovered was that thus the role of NC60
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:17.080]   in the cellular responses is likely not due to the direct effect of the C60
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:22.360]   material surface on the cells but related to the conversion of the THF
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:28.480]   into a toxic by-product during the preparation of suspension all right the
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.480]   other study that I found a study of studies called the biological effects of
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.600]   C60 fullerene revealed with bacterial biosensor toxic or rather anti-toxin
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:43.800]   that study discovered that their their exact action on cells strongly depends
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:48.160]   on many factors including experimental conditions preparations the solvents
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.800]   used which have contributed to the confusion regarding their safety and
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.280]   possible health benefits and that's my point and here are studies that back up
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:03.680]   my point it all comes down to what what was you know is what if you read a study
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.280]   there's a section called materials and methods and it's basically you know the
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:13.000]   details the devil is in the details so what did you do how did you do it what
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.520]   did you use right what did you do now you know everything every aspect of the
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:22.360]   study and so when we say what have we learned about C60 I want to know because
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:27.680]   I take copious amounts of C60 in oil and also I take it topically I want to
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.800]   know you know what is it doing to me in the form that I'm doing it in and so
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.240]   what we've learned right is that you know any claim that it does is DNA damage
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:41.400]   well it's C60 is not water soluble you know and so and there's all so basically
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.560]   don't ever take C60 put it in water and drink it okay bad and then there's a
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.280]   heavy use of solvents you read some of these studies and it's unbelievable that
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.320]   they'll just have all of these solvents that they're using and different like
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.760]   you know different types of food additives that are used as you know every
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.000]   water's a solvent so there's tons of different solvents and so if there's one
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.280]   that's like in food that people use in food in the food industry you know they'll
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.720]   use that as a as a medium for putting in C60 and then they'll then there's
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.520]   studies where they'll take it and they'll just basically they've I've seen
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.800]   studies or red studies where they'll have the you know the the lab animals
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:20.440]   you know inhale C60 like dust I've seen them where they inject it into their
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:25.720]   into their abdominal cavity I've seen 666 studies where they'll just inject it
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:30.720]   into embryos fish embryos and bacteria you know it's like okay so what do we
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.600]   learn well we learn that you do all that stuff and has nothing to do with us
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:40.280]   humans taking lipo-foolering 616 oil it just doesn't you can't compare apples
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.460]   to oranges so what are the weighted factors that are the most important
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:48.200]   thing when we're doing a research study on what have we learned about C60 in
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:53.640]   oil lipo-foolerines well I want to just say that based on the studies of studies
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.560]   and based on just just the common sense that there are weighted factors and then
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.680]   what's really important about what we have learned are studies that that
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:09.920]   basically are going to look at how we are processing C60 taking C60 and so
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.960]   what it really comes down to is I kind of just have gotten to the point where if
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:21.080]   it's not a study that they have lipo-foolerine C60 in oil and not just any
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:25.960]   kind of oil preferably olive oil okay there's a few other oils but you know
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.360]   there's like even like that Japanese study they did it in corn oil or corn
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:33.720]   most of corn is GMO and so you know you've got all these different factors so if
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.880]   you just stick with olive oil but not just any olive oil it's organic cold
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:43.720]   pressed you know E-O-V or E whatever you know Rachel Ray right
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.520]   E-E-V so if not something anyway but the whole idea though is that's the best
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.320]   highest quality some of the best producers of C60 oil on the market they
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:57.120]   have contracts with farms directly and they cold shipped the olive oil to you
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.520]   I have a friend of mine that you know was in the shipping business for several
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.240]   years and we talked about it one time and he said yeah and those containers you
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.400]   know those big mats in you know containers that the temperature can get up
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:12.920]   to 150 125 sorry not 150 but about 125 degrees in the summer you know being
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.360]   shipped around or in trucks so you know a lot of times that and this is true if
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:21.360]   you study the oil in olive oil industry like 99% of olive oil in on the markets
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:26.440]   not real olive oil it's just you know it's fake olive oil also that a majority
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.520]   of that are a large portion of the olive oil that you'll see on the store
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.640]   shelves are already partially rancid because they've been on they've been in
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:37.360]   transport subjected to heat subjected to light sitting on the shelf so it
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.320]   really made it really matters that it's the highest absolute quality of oil and
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.480]   then also olive oil has been found to be the absolute best oil to use for C60
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.680]   saturation so it's so important that when you look at studies to understand
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:55.360]   what we have learned that we we focus in on the fact that it's a lipofluorine
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:01.600]   in a very healthy oil lipofluorine means that it's been completely dissolved
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.640]   into the oil it's been formed into what they call liposomes and each separate
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:12.200]   molecule at a one molecule level okay not closely you know crystalline
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:17.200]   clusters of C60 but one molecule is so important it's wrapped around it's
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.320]   wrapped around by fatty lipids and it creates what they call a liposome you
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.200]   can see them under a microscope and that you when you filter your oil after you're
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.440]   done making it and I have made I don't know three years at this point I've made
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.480]   gallons and gallons and gallons of this stuff but you filter it through a very
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:39.760]   fine filter and you filter out anything larger than 0.22 microns and you get
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:44.000]   oil you get nothing else in the oil it's just oil is darker now because it's got
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.160]   all those lipofluorines in it but it's just the smallest particulate size which
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.840]   is the next point here some of the studies I've read they've got particulate
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.520]   sizes 130 nanometers all the way up to like five 600 nanometers and that's
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:03.280]   really important because think about it a C60 molecule is one nanometer you can
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:09.040]   line up 100,000 C60 molecules side by side and it would equal the width of the
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.280]   common human hair okay that's how small it is so if you're taking C60 in chunks
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:19.760]   crystalline chunks as noted before those crystalline chunks contain solvent
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.880]   molecules then it's not healthy for you so when you're looking at studies that
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.720]   say hey you know what I look at studies I want to know it's lipofluorine in a
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:33.240]   healthy oil the particulate size was hey you made it you filtered it 0.22
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:39.040]   microns like just like the rat study did and also the way that the the C60 oil
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.680]   was given to the animals okay very important because you know they there's
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.680]   all these different ways like I said through shots through inhalation but it's
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.560]   all it's got to just be through oral administration not forced feeding using
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.640]   gavages okay and then you also think you also the other part which is common
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:59.080]   sense which is we're not flies we're not bacteria we have a lot of it in us
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.640]   but we're mammals and so it's got to be a million study and so when you look at
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:08.360]   these weighted factors and say yeah based on these criteria okay and the
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:12.400]   results from when you look at a study using this criteria and the methodology
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:18.520]   of the body study then we can really really really get down to what is the
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:25.120]   results what is really happening now with C60 as a health supplement so let's
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.960]   talk about what happens when you look at that in that way so what I did was and
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:35.520]   this took a lot of time this this is this research was a month in the making I
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:41.480]   had to go through dozens and dozens of studies and weed out all these different
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:47.680]   ways that people did C60 studies because the results to me are not relevant to
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.880]   what's important to us which is hey well you know you know like I just did and so
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:57.720]   after going through dozens of studies for the brevity I just pulled I found five
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.000]   out of a couple dozen and it took a long time because you have to read these
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.800]   things okay and so this is I want to share with you what I found I found five
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.600]   studies and you know for sake of brevity I'm not going to go through them
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.880]   like the other ones but they're in that directory okay and I just summarize it
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:17.400]   here well when you go exactly to these weighted factors so that you know you
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.120]   want to know exactly what you know what the results are studies using this then
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:25.760]   this is what's pretty interesting I've out of two dozen studies roughly okay I
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.600]   only found five that actually did it that way that actually use lipofolourines
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.440]   blah blah blah okay and so now one of them had bad results in terms of negative
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.320]   negative results and in terms of it negatively affected the microbiome
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:42.680]   biota and it also had an effect on glucose and which raised insulin
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:47.000]   resistance and I think that there's one there's the one study now and I think
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.280]   that there's a lot more research needs to be happening here because they did
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:54.640]   fine that it does have some negative effects and so it's a great study and
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.120]   so I think there's a lot more research has to be done remember this is all
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:03.680]   about science and there's it's not good or bad results or you know okay in
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.440]   context okay but the idea is that hey you know what some of the somebody's found
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.080]   something that it doesn't do great you know and there's all these people out
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.200]   there selling 60 always saying you know it's the greatest thing to slice bread
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.880]   well you know let's let's you know let's level set that it's not there's you
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.720]   know we still have a lot to learn and here's one study I think it came out in
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.400]   2019 and you know in this time period what we have learned is that hey it's
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.280]   not you know it's not all you know you know corn's and Raybose there are some
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:29.240]   there are some discoveries here that are finding out that it does cause some
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:33.600]   problems so we need to look a lot more into that is this the end all thing and
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.320]   everybody that you know should stop taking it of course not because when you
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.520]   look at some of the other studies you know four out of five that I found and
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.440]   this all completely random unbiased okay was I found a study using the same
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.680]   weighted criteria whereas very positive for the liver and brain very positive
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:51.440]   another study that was very positive for died you know people with diabetes and
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.560]   their effect and its effect on the liver very positive results on a
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:00.200]   apoptosis apoptosis and autophagy flux and another one that was very good for
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:05.200]   kidneys and so the point that I'm trying to make here is when you you weed out
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.120]   all the stuff that has just really kind of not it's not relevant and you look
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.880]   at just the weighted factors four to five results of studies just in that area
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:18.040]   were very positive and one that wasn't and so you know more research needs to be
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:21.920]   done but so far looking pretty good when you take a look at the research of all
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.280]   of this then I kind of did a pros and cons the so I just want to summarize it
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.960]   the pro in what we have learned what have we learned hey well you know what
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:35.280]   C60 is not toxic you know C60 is and these studies by the way we read these
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:40.600]   studies they all confirm all of this information that it is a very exceptional
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:46.520]   reactive oxygen species sponge slash scavenger it does mop it basically and
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.760]   I'll get into that in the video but how it does that but it's just it's it's
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:55.600]   exceptional as an antioxidant in fact the body study claim that C60 was a
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:00.360]   hundred seventy two times more potent as an antioxidant than vitamin C and
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.760]   what's interesting is that ion Mitchell study on dogs discovered that's that he
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:09.440]   discovered it was actually 250 times more potent as an antioxidant than
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:14.600]   vitamin C so you know it's it's well you know like I just said it's very good
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.160]   at being an antioxidant and also you know like I just said it's it supports
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.160]   liver and brain function it supports autopsis and ophthalmology supports
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.480]   kidneys and then there's other information out here and you know you can
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:30.000]   go I can go on and on and on but there's been more videos more testimonies more
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.520]   studies where there's a macular you know it supports macular degeneration in
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:39.960]   other words it it relieves it if not hears it it's extremely good at any
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.240]   inflammatory and more and you know I'm trying to keep this video as short as
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:47.400]   possible because yeah I could go on for an hour or more and I don't want to do
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:52.280]   that but there's so much more on the pro side in the last three years from
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:56.680]   just the testimonials and also some of the people doing experiments you know
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:01.280]   people people not scientist people okay so there's a lot more about the pros of
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.000]   C60 as a health supplement it's the only reason that after three years I still
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.480]   take it daily okay and and I read all of these things I am not I'm not put off
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.320]   by the fact that there's one study that says is not that great I think there
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.800]   needs to be more research and that's that and so now the cons right well that's
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.160]   that's well we know it's a pro-oxidant we're supposed to like bottom line keep
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.600]   you stuff dark there are solvents in there okay and then you know I get into
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.520]   that I got two of videos on that parts per billion you know are people really
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.200]   worried about solvents well you if you really are worried then you really
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:37.040]   need to buy a C60's quote solvent free and only buy it if it's been made with
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:42.880]   sublimated C60 personally you know I don't worry this much about it because
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:46.400]   you know there's so much pollution and chemicals and blah blah blah in our
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:50.480]   environment that you know it's it's to me it's it's a minor thing but there are
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:55.480]   people who are very sensitive to solvents and when they take a non solvent free
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.200]   C60 oil product there have been lots of reports of people getting ill from it
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.960]   because they're sensitive to solvents I'm not one of those people so I don't
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.680]   have a problem with it but I do make sure that I buy from a very reputable
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.360]   company in terms of the Rossi 60 that I use I don't buy commercial products
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.080]   okay now and also of course that you know that study about microbiota and
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:19.040]   glucose and then the dosages are questionable okay now so you know talking
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.560]   about dosages are questionable I want to point out one more study they have
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.560]   found and then lastly of course there's more to be discovered and then you know
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.800]   let's talk about that too let's talk about this let's talk about dosages and
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.520]   extended life spent one of the things that I thought was so interesting and I
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.560]   just before I was about to make this video right in the process like I said
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.760]   it took me a month to put this together right in the middle of this month
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:46.960]   November 3rd this girl who runs the Sheaky Science Show put out a video
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:52.400]   covering this one study and it was pretty interesting it's a very interesting
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:57.280]   study it came out in 2020 it came out the last week of October and you know
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.680]   right now it's like November the 14th so only like a couple of weeks ago the
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.000]   study got published the study is called C60 and olive oil causes light dependent
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.040]   toxicity and does not extend life span in mice read that does not extend life
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.080]   span in mice I thought wow that's interesting so the point that this study
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:21.200]   was made in this this lady girl made a video about the study was that her you
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.840]   know basically well it's using the weighted factors it's exactly the way
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:29.520]   they did it exactly and that's the rat study they used mice instead and their
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:33.480]   conclusions in this study was that it had a light dependent toxicity well you
[00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.880]   know as I mentioned earlier yeah keep it dark we know that so that's not
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.800]   surprised but it also found out that it does not extend the life span in mice
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.000]   so they basically did the same thing as the rats except the mice didn't live
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.080]   longer that's kind of interesting right but you know what in when you're
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:52.000]   reading this study there's a little gem in this study that I think is so
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   important for dimension to all of you so one of the things that this study
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.880]   discovered is they went and they bought different C60 commercial products and
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:05.840]   they evaluated them and in this study and I want to quote this and it's they came
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:10.480]   out with their conclusion this is in the study and it says commercial C60 olive
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:16.720]   oil has unpredictable concentrations and activity we performed an HPLC that's a
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.920]   high-performance liquid chroma chromatography study on the samples and
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:27.000]   found a notable increase in impurity peaks in the commercial samples again with
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.840]   HPLC we measured the concentration of C60 in each sample and compared it to the
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:38.200]   claimed concentration on the label we again found remarkable variability in
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:44.440]   C60 concentration and in deviation from the stated concentration I think that's
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:49.120]   this you know what this is a gem it's the first study that I've seen an
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:53.220]   official study that I've seen where somebody went out and bought some
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.000]   commercial products and actually said hey is the label accurate right because
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.160]   none of this is regulated by the FDA so you can whatever you got on the label
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.760]   you know it's not you're not regulated to have to prove it right or have or it
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:11.320]   for it to be accurate okay and so this study actually points out that they
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.920]   discovered and they only did four so let's be honest okay they only did four
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.240]   products but here's the study that they found that one of the lowest
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:24.280]   concentration of C60 in one commercial product was 0.57 milligrams per
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:28.660]   milliliter and they found another one that was 1.4 milligrams per milliliter
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:33.920]   now the rat study which is the benchmark for everybody that sells this stuff the
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:38.600]   rat study if you follow exactly the way they did it is the benchmark is 0.8
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:44.520]   milligrams per milliliter of C60 in oil it's specifically olive oil in this case
[00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:49.080]   all right and so why is this so important well if you look at if you look at this
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:55.560]   range between four separate products the variance is 145 percent it's huge it
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:00.720]   is huge that means the standards from for producing C60 oil in the commercial
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:06.920]   and you know for commercial sale is all over the map 145% variance between low
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:12.280]   and high is unbelievably high that's a huge variance okay and the second thing
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:17.440]   is is that well you know you guys and myself you know where I'm not out to
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:23.040]   supplement on olive oil I'm out to supplement on C60 so try to imagine that
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.160]   if you bought one product and you thought you're taking the regular dose
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.160]   of C60 and you bought this other product and it's literally three times as much
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:37.120]   you know almost three times as much C60s in it so when it comes to dosages the
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:41.160]   con here on the C60 and what we have learned because of this incredible
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.760]   study and again one study does not you know make everything but I'll get into
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:49.480]   that a second but it's it's definitely a con because the dosages are questionable
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:53.400]   are you really getting the amount of C60 you think you are right because you're
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:57.240]   not paying to buy oil if you wanted to drink oil you just go to your grocery
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:01.960]   store and buy oil and drink it it's very expensive it is really expensive so how
[00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.080]   much are you taking and that's what and this what the study comes out it says
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:09.160]   well it's pretty questionable at this point now has there been any has there
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:13.080]   been any other studies that that kind of even looked at this little point here
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.440]   this old dosages are questionable well yes I want to point out that there are
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:22.840]   two on the longevity forum those guys back in the day they all kind of got it
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.920]   they did a they did a crowdsourcing thing where they they all found a lab that
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:30.920]   would test it for them and then a whole bunch of them started sending them you
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.480]   know products that they had bought from different places and they only ended up
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.280]   with three different products at the time because that was like back in the
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.000]   ancient ancient days of C60 right and they did actually evaluate three
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.960]   separate different products and it's on the forum somewhere in the longevity
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.240]   forum and they found that they had a huge range of difference between you
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:55.200]   know the bottom number and the top number as well and then also if you're
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.160]   familiar with SES research as I just mentioned Chris Burris one of the
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:02.520]   founders he actually did a study himself where he bought several commercial
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:06.720]   products he talked about it in one of his videos which I can't find yet but I
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.560]   remember him talking about it in a video where he said that SES went and took a
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:14.360]   look at a bunch of different commercial products and they also found a large
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:19.800]   variance in in saturation in terms of the amount of C60 in the oil so it is
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.580]   definitely a con you know in Chris Burris by the way is you know one of the
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:27.400]   founders SES and very reputable so just like I and Mitchell so when you talk
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:33.120]   about dosages are questionable it is definitely a con in the current world of
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:37.800]   C60 health supplements because you don't really know when people look at these
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.040]   products how much C60 is really in there does it map to the label and so you
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:45.960]   know how do you how do you counter that well you make your own I make my own I
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.880]   don't worry about it or you go with some of the very well established C60
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.640]   companies that measure it test it and then when they put it on the label they
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.600]   know it's correct because they they wouldn't put it through an HPLC analysis
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:01.200]   and they know that their end product is actually what it says it is okay so
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.440]   that's what's really important but right now there's so many commercial products
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:08.800]   out there and it's it's been proven now you know I would say that it's been
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.480]   proven to a point that dosages are questionable and then of course there's
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.800]   more to be discovered so again you know just another reminder that we are the
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:21.160]   human trial okay there's there's never been a published trial like I said so
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:26.040]   if you're taking C60 oil you are participating in a human trial and right
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:31.320]   now the pros definitely outweigh the cons I I am very very much after doing this
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.360]   research for a month very convinced that it's the best thing for me and I
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.760]   continue to take a lot of it as I said and then lastly you know but does it
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.880]   extend lifespan in humans really does it extend lifespan in humans you've got
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:47.240]   all these studies up here you know you did you've got the you know the pair of
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:52.920]   study and you've got the live pet study that basically backed it up saying yeah
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:59.160]   it does it does extend lifespan in rats and then you've got this study that says
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:03.720]   it doesn't do that in mice so does it extend lifespan in humans question mark
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.600]   question mark it's gonna take a long time before we actually know it that is
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.960]   that a reason you should stop taking it or maybe for you guys marketing this
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.880]   stuff maybe you should like temper your little you know verbiage on your
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.040]   websites because in reality we don't know yet because it definitely didn't do
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.440]   that for mice so would that do it for humans what's the difference I don't know
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:27.360]   a lot more studies to be done but the point I want to make the pros outweigh
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:32.720]   the cons and that's what we have learned in C60 in the last three years so I
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.200]   want to say thank you for watching my video I hope that and I just you know I
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.600]   make these videos because I I'm really curious I want to learn and I learned
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.120]   three years ago when I started my channel that the other people like this
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.560]   they like to hear about what I'm learning so that's what I'm doing I'm
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:52.640]   researching and I'm studying and I'm sharing what I learn you know at no
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:56.800]   cost to you and and I don't make anything off of it I just want to say thank you
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:00.800]   for your time thank you for watching this video I hope it was educational for
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:05.840]   you now if you want to learn more about C60 I have a huge library of
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.080]   information about it over on my blog called the Tinkers Academy to get there
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:14.440]   you just type in Tinkers.academy in your URL window on your browser it'll take
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:18.680]   you right to my blog and go to the C60 page tons of information and I've
[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:22.240]   categorized all of my different videos and you know I never thought three years
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.520]   ago that I could make over 30 videos about one molecule but I did and so
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:28.960]   there's a lot you know I categorized everything and organized it all nicely
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:33.880]   on my blog in there and it's called the Tinkers Academy also we have a C60 chat
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:39.000]   group on telegram that just talks about C60 making C60 the market and so forth
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.920]   and you can go ahead and click the link below in the video description and come
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:47.280]   join and if you got questions about C60 about how to make C60 you know come
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.040]   on over and join and join the group and and ask away so again you know thank you
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:56.360]   so much for your time I really appreciate your you know your interest
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:00.280]   and I really truly appreciate the positive comments and your kind words
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:05.360]   that you share with me so thank you so much lastly before I go this is part one
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.720]   there is gonna be a part two I didn't want to make you know again you know
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:12.760]   this is already almost 50 minutes but I had so much content and that I want to
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.600]   share with you a part two on more of what we have learned let's talk about the
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:22.120]   C60 hydrogen connection C60 oil production methods the product evolution
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.800]   and then I'm also where do we go from here and we you know because we've
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.960]   learned a lot so I have a what we have learned about C60 part two coming up I
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:34.800]   don't know when soon hopefully but that's what's coming up for part two and I
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:38.960]   hope you do have a chance to jump in and watch that when you do so again thank
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:41.160]   Thank you so much and Aloha.
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.160]   Have a great day.
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:42.760]   Bye.
