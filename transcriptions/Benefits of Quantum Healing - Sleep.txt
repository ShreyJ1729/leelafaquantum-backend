[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.980]   Kammer and this is another installment in the series benefits of quantum healing
[00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.960]   with a focus on sleep helping people attain better sleep getting to sleep
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.960]   faster and feeling more rested while they're sleeping and how does quantum
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.900]   healing work with that. So the first thing though is that unfortunately there
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.840]   have not been any studies that have been conducted by the Q in regards to this
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.880]   this particular topic however there have been numerous testimonies over the last
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.520]   few years as the frequency has been available in terms of the sleep
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.320]   frequency. So I wanted to kind of walk you through literally what we've learned
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.600]   over the last couple of years in terms of how customers have been using the
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.960]   you know quantum energy products in terms of helping themselves sleep and kind of
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.160]   just share with you some of their testimonies including one that I have
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.360]   that was interesting. So now obviously let's just jump into it you know sleep is
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.840]   literally the holy grail of health. I have for for me anyone who doesn't get
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.840]   good sleep will agree with that and I'm one of those individuals. So now over the
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.880]   last couple years what we've discovered is that you know some individuals are
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.920]   literally sensitive enough to the quantum energy that it does something to them
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.180]   that actually helps them sleep just the quantum energy itself but more so the
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.200]   majority of people that have commented on how quantum healing has helped them
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.180]   attain better sleep is through using the frequencies that are available and so
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.500]   there's two frequencies that come up more than any others and that's the one
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.040]   that's called calm and rest used to be called sleep and rest and another
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.100]   frequency called inner peace and you'll see those in the testimonies in terms of
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.320]   how people have been using those both in the quantum upgrade service as well as
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.180]   just actually holding the physical you know card with the with the frequency in
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.380]   it. So the suggestion so far that we've kind of accumulated to kind of help
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.980]   people who are interested in working on better sleep using quantum products is
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.180]   that the first one is that you know for using blocks and capsules towards
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.460]   improving your sleep you know it really is kind of it's interesting that we've
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.700]   got testimonies that are that are on both sides of the fence in terms of like
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.020]   and I would say that the majority of people feel that the energy coming off
[00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.160]   of a block or a capsule is just too much energy and it doesn't you know it
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.520]   doesn't let them have a good night's sleep you know there are a few people
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.900]   that literally you know there's actually a testimony I found where someone
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.200]   actually got better sleep with it but most people and even the recommendation
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.800]   from Layla Q is that if you have a block it's best to not put it in your
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.640]   bedroom because it is quite a powerful device a capsule is you know is just
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.880]   as powerful in terms of just a strength and some folks and I'm personally like
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.200]   this where I I cannot wear a capsule or have a block in my bedroom or it really
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.880]   will interrupt my sleep so I'm one of those on that side of the fence but there's
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.920]   others out there that actually doing it so you really need to see what works for
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.320]   you. So again you know if you know I would always start out with leaving the
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.840]   block outside of your bedroom and taking your capsule off but you know it helps
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.480]   also some people find you know that it helps if they take it off at least an
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.880]   hour before they go to bed and so that it so that the energy doesn't interfere
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.760]   with their sleep but where the most success has come from is where we look
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.520]   at when the card and the quantum upgrade frequencies are helping people get
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.120]   better night's sleep and so the way that people have approached it and this is
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.800]   the recommendation is that you know if you get the card which is either the
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.720]   common rest card or the inner peace card you know place it under your pillow if
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.320]   you have the physical card or if you're using the quantum upgrade service then
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.040]   usually it's just setting the you know setting the nighttime Hawkins level to
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.680]   the lowest at 500 and then using the inner peace frequency so that you'll
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.000]   getting that inner peace frequency. In fact you know when if you talk to the
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   founder of Leila Q you know he he actually is very very you know happy with
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.280]   you know in his in his response in terms of like what works best for him for
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.960]   sleep is the inner peace as I just described number two which is using the
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.280]   inner peace at night he finds out to be very helpful and you know in terms of
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.360]   restfulness sleep. So that's kind of you know that's kind of what has been
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.800]   coming out so again see what works for you and and know that you know just you
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.040]   know just be aware that you know there's a lot of energy in those devices it's
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.560]   best to keep them out of your room but then the frequencies work quite well so
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.960]   that's something that's real important that we've learned in the last couple of
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.960]   years. Now I just want to share with you some of the testimony so you kind of get
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.160]   an idea of what people have been experiencing as it relates to quantum
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.040]   healing and sleep. So the very first one and this is by the way these are all
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.080]   public posts on the telegram chat group and they're out there for you to view
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.440]   and you know you know telegram is just everything scrolls away so fast so
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.360]   that's why I collect these testimonies so you can kind of get an idea where
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.480]   they're all collecting you know collect them all in one place on one subject and
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.400]   it really kind of helps you kind of you know convey the idea of how how people
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.960]   are experiencing the different things so for this one for sleep the first one is
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.000]   from why not and and they basically commented on telegram that by the way
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.200]   an update on my sleep from the quantum upgrade and using the inner piece at night
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.120]   as I just mentioned I'm still having the best sleep and I'm finding that I'm
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.760]   having very vivid dreams I usually find that happens when I'm detoxing but so
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.840]   that's amazing that you know it's working well for this individual through
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.080]   the quantum upgrade service now from Stephen Fisher he's actually using the
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.320]   physical card and my wife and I have both been receiving deeper sleep by
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.000]   placing the sleep and rest card under our pillows I bought one card for her
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.720]   pillow and then made a copy of it a few days later for her under my pillow my
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.440]   wife is a real night owl and she's able to break that cycle more regularly with
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.240]   the cards I go to bed by 10 30 and usually wake up early but the card helps
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.160]   me sleep longer so that's awesome now from Gus he says sleeping with the
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.680]   sleep card under my pillow after 30+ years I've started to dream again that's
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.880]   wild that's awesome and then from Rafael yes the inner priest inner piece
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.680]   frequency I sleep like a baby now from Stephen he reports I have been sleeping
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.160]   with the sleep and rest card under my pillow for three months now and without
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.320]   a doubt the quality of my sleep is vastly improved and I can get by with less
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.080]   sleep once in a while when I have to work late and get up early so that's
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.400]   that's awesome the last one I want to share with you is just customer feedback
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.640]   from robots can't swim the sleep and rest card has an effect on my sleep as
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.600]   does the inner piece I think the sleep and rest cards keep me asleep whereas I
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.520]   used to wake up in the night the inner piece calms my raving thoughts at bedtime
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.320]   so I think it helps me fall sleep faster I had the best sleep when I had an eye
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.000]   block two and an eye block four in the same room I only had an eye block four
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.840]   for one night but that might have been the most restful night in the last decade
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.200]   your peaceful deep sleep with zero stressful dreams and you know so that's
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.080]   where you know it's pretty wild that someone had two blocks in their bedroom
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.000]   and had the best sleep so I haven't tried that personally because that would just
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   be way too much for me so that you know but it but like I said earlier it
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.720]   really depends on you but you know if you kind of tinker with it which which is
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.320]   my whole deal right tinkering tinker with what works for you and you you
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.400]   probably will find that sweet spot of the combination for how you can use your
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.560]   quantum healing tools to help you get better sleep now the last one I one
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:28.880]   more one more testimony this is mine now my daughter's adult daughter came to me
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.400]   you know about a month ago and she basically told me hey dad you know I'm
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.120]   having a hard time sleeping you know can you can you can you can you do
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.160]   something for me and you know as as a tinker my first thought was challenge
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:46.200]   accepted so I gave her the common rest card and she went home and tried it for
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.640]   a week or two and then I how's it going and she said well it's not working at
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.280]   all for me so I'm like okay challenge accepted so then I decided to actually
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.200]   make kind of like a booster so this is an idea that worked for me because what
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:03.080]   I did was I made a little sleep booster card out of the different things that I
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.480]   had it on hand so I just kind of just and I recorded it that's right something
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:12.880]   new I'm making a sleep booster help my daughter sleep so I'm using two
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.680]   Leila frequencies in her piece and sleep and I'm also combining that with
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:25.280]   cannabis and ylang ylang and lavender essential oil and see what happens so
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.240]   that's what I did I made another card out of a combination of Leila frequencies
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.560]   and molecular frequencies and you know you can do that right you can just kind
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.640]   of tinker up your own little booster and then I said okay now try this and after
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:41.360]   two weeks how's it going honey and you know what she said I'm having awesome
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.120]   sleep I can go to bed fast sleep through the night get very rested and so she
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.960]   was really happy with this other version that I had created from tinkering around
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.400]   and I really want to encourage you guys if you own a block go for it you know
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.640]   that's what you do that's what this is all about that's what blocks do so you
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.280]   know so sometimes you know the card itself or the frequency itself might not
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.760]   work and then as you heard from one testimony that somebody combined the two
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.800]   I'd put it a block you know they tinkered around and found that sweet spot
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.680]   for them and how they got it to work in my example I was able to help my daughter
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.880]   get better sleep by simply taking the same concept and making a new card out
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:25.040]   of it right with some essential oils and and molecular frequency cannabis and
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.600]   adding to the Leila frequencies made a booster for and it worked really well
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.400]   for and it was really helpful for her but you know after all this is said and
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.680]   done what I want to say before I hang hang up early leave you is that you know
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:44.040]   for me personally I have tried everything and I haven't found anything that works
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:51.160]   so I suspect that I had something happen to my brain from an incident over a
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.240]   decade ago and ever since then I've become biphasic and I only sleep just a
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.680]   few hours at a time and twice a day so you know it's just it doesn't work for
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.640]   me and so I've tried I've tried everything and so you know and that again
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.240]   is a testimony towards a you know some people just doesn't work but you know
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.400]   a lot of people it does you got to find your sweet spot and personally I
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.960]   haven't found my sweet spot and I wanted to share that with you to be
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.840]   transparent you know it's not going to work for everybody so for me it didn't
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.280]   work for my daughter it did for all the folks that left testimonies it did and
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.160]   so the idea of getting the benefits of quantum healing to help you get a more
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.040]   restful night sleeping deeper and sleeping faster is there there's there's
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.120]   that potential and it's been documented by the people that are using the products
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.040]   and it's a definitely has a potential to help you with your sleep and I wish you
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.880]   a good rest you know and go ahead and tinker see what happens and and see how
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.240]   you can help yourself so that's it for that now if you want to learn more about
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.360]   quantum energy feel you know I'll be putting links in the video description
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.560]   for Laila quantum tech and also for the upgrade service and if you ever want to
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.440]   learn more about you know what I've been doing at the Tinkers Academy I've got a
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.320]   whole section of my blog dedicated to quantum energy and all of them for
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.640]   Tinkers and things I've been doing for years now so there you go if you want to
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.280]   get hold of us that's where you get hold of us and I appreciate your time
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.320]   today thanks for watching this video I really do hope that this helps you and
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.920]   I really appreciate your time I know it's valuable and precious and I really do
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.480]   appreciate you spending some time with me today so other than that have a great
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.240]   day Allah
