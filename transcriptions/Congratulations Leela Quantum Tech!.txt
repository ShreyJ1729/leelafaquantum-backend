[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.920]   to driving positive change in wellness.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.840]   All right, so let's jump right in.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.200]   Wow, we had a tremendous response from this campaign.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:11.400]   We ended up with 77 nominations and over 11,000 votes.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.720]   So our nominations fall into five categories, and what we're going to be doing this evening
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.440]   is we're going to take a look at who was nominated, who made it to the final round,
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.040]   and tada, who are the winners.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.440]   Okay, next category we have, mental health and well-being.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.320]   The Mental Health and Wellbeing Innovation Award recognizes new therapeutic approaches
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.880]   and advancements in technology that address the rising mental health crisis, enhance emotional
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.560]   well-being, and foster resilience.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.580]   So the finalists are, since AI, the world's most complete brain training system for home
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.600]   use, the ultimate five-in-one enhanced neurofeedback headset and gamification app that provides

[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.160]   well-being, and advanced meditative states.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.960]   Wheel of Quantum text, heel capsule, again, has been researched and tested extensively,
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.640]   and this product from Wheel of Quantum contains primal human healing frequency and primal water
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.280]   frequency along with nutritional bio-based frequencies.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.600]   It can be worn around your neck, which is nice because some of their other devices, you
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.640]   can only use at home.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.280]   Love Life Supplements Calm is a formulation of carefully selected ingredients which can

[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.320]   your brain's performance.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.120]   This is one of those products that I'm seeing out at a lot of conferences right now.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.960]   Every time I sneak over there and I do my brain tap session because I get so busy and
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.200]   so overwhelmed by all the conversations and all of the new information and I can say firsthand
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.640]   that that brain tap works, so I'm not surprised that the brain tap community is stepping up
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.920]   and saying a big yes to brain tap.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.840]   Let's find out which product in this category is the winner for this share.
