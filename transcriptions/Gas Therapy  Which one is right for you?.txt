[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040]   Aloha, everyone, and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.600]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and in this video, I'd like to talk with you about gas therapy.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.720]   Now this is the idea of using gases in place of pharmaceuticals for things like pain management,
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.520]   wound healing, general health, and all sorts of different applications that has been in play
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.960]   in the clinical setting for decades.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.320]   And so now there are multiple different kinds of gases that you could use.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.640]   And so the idea here is which one is right for you.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.320]   So let's talk about that.
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.440]   Now first, I've got a disclaimer, it's a typical disclaimer, you know, work with your physician,
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.280]   don't take advice from strangers on an internet and blah, blah, blah.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.800]   Okay, so that's all of that.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.400]   Now the links to everything I'm discussing, all the research, products, you name it, and
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.480]   all that's going to be in the video description.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.640]   So if you got any questions, you want to do your own research, then go ahead and click
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.240]   on the video description for those links and so forth.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.720]   So now let's just jump in.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.040]   So what is gas therapy?
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.560]   And as I just said, it's essentially to replace what you would maybe sometimes go and get,
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.280]   you know, pharmaceutical for its supplementation.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.960]   It's something that you could do to help your body heal for general health and so forth.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.000]   And so it's the main idea though about gases and this is what really is pronounced in the
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.440]   literature and all the research that I've done is that it has a substitute for pharmaceuticals.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.440]   Okay?
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.720]   It, the absolute lack of side effects is huge and there's no addictive.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.800]   So like to say you're using a gas for pain management, well, you're not going to get
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.960]   addicted to it like you would an opioid.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.240]   And that's a huge, huge issue obviously, right?
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.520]   And then the whole idea behind, you know, if you decide to go with gas and you buy your
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.080]   own gas generator, you don't have to keep going back to the pharmacy over and over and
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.440]   over for whatever it is your, you know, your doctor prescribed you.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.360]   So it's a really interesting and viable alternative to pharmaceuticals that also, you know, has
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.040]   been prescribed by doctors as well, but also you can do it at home.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.120]   So it's a really good way to kind of heal yourself, to take care of your health, also
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.920]   for biohacking in terms of anti-aging, for those of you who are into that.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.720]   And that's what some of these gases can provide for you.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.760]   And these benefits are all really sound and have been around for quite a while.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.400]   So now there are numerous types of gases and I'm going to just concentrate and focus on
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.000]   four different specific gases in this video.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.880]   And the first one is going to be hydrogen, also known as molecular hydrogen, and then
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.520]   also oxygen therapy and then ozone therapy.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.640]   And then also this last one called browns gas.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.120]   It's also called hydroxy or HHO.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.440]   And the last one here, this browns gas is relatively new for the use of, you know, using
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.120]   this gas for health.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.880]   And there's not a ton of research on that one yet, but you know, it's coming along.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.440]   So the whole idea here is that hydrogen is literally, it's just one of the gases.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.280]   It's got basically two hydrogen atoms and that's what it's H2O2, same thing, two oxygen
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.960]   atoms connected together.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.840]   Oh, ozone now is where you've got three oxygen atoms connected together, very unstable.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.400]   And so what happens when you start working with ozone is that it's not stable.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.080]   A third little oxygen wants to just, you know, atom wants to pop off and go off on its own,
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.560]   you know, kind of, and so, and then, and then at that point, you've got oxygen, but the
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.040]   whole idea, though, is you've got that extra little oxygen atom floating around in your
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.200]   body.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   And the combination is actually pretty healthy for you in terms of using it for health.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.800]   And then of course, there's the browns gas, which is H2O2 combined.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.280]   And then it forms what they call hydroxy.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.440]   And so this is separate, it's a combination of the gases.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.360]   And because it's a combination, it actually does some interesting things.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.160]   So these are the four different gases I'll be talking about.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.720]   And I want to share with you that I'm going to give you a summary of the research that
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   I've done.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.880]   I've spent quite a long time researching this.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.000]   I've actually been using gases for my own supplementation, for my own health and healing.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.720]   For well over a decade, I actually started with ozone about 10 years ago and about five
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.720]   years ago.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.880]   I also got really into browns gas.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.360]   And so now the research that I pulled and I've got you links below in the video description,
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.800]   they come from the Molecular Hydrogen Institute.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.480]   So if you wanted to actually look at the scientific studies and if I go into that, I did be like
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.480]   a four hour video.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.360]   So I'm just going to give you a super high level overview summary of the research.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.800]   And if you want to actually read the papers and read the research, and this is where you
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.920]   would go, links below in the video description.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.760]   So there's the Molecular Hydrogen Institute.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.600]   There's the American Lung Association website on the area of oxygen therapy.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.360]   There's the Medical Ozone Research Institute.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.720]   And then these are huge institutes.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.280]   They've been around for decades and decades and decades.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.840]   And the science of these gats is used for healthcare, medical, and treatment, as it just
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.840]   goes back.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.040]   There's just a ton of science behind it.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.760]   There's no question as to what it does and the fact that it works.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.680]   And so there's also been books written about it, but several different doctors who've done
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.200]   tons of studies on it.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.080]   And so these books or anything from the hydrogen medicine book, "Flood Your Body with Oxygen
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.080]   and the Ozone Miracle," these three books are not available in the video links description.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.760]   But I do have a telegram chat group, which I actually do a book of the day.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.560]   So they may come up in the near future as giveaways.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.880]   So if you want to just come down to our chat group, you can join me there and probably
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.200]   get access to the books.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.400]   But if you want to actually take a look at the research studies and so forth, these are
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.760]   the three institutes you can go to.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.360]   And you can definitely do your own research, but let me go ahead and give you a summary
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.520]   here in a second.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.560]   Now the last one here is the Brown's Gas Research.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.440]   As I mentioned, it's fairly new to the health environment.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:01.160]   Now all of these gasses have been used, they have industrial and commercial usage.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.760]   And they've been used for all sorts of different industrial purposes.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.920]   And same thing with Brown's Gas.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.480]   And so they all have this root, this foundation in using them in industry, and then they've
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.360]   been used for health as well for all this time.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.120]   Brown's Gas is the latest addition to that concept of using a gas for health.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.280]   There's not a lot of research.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.600]   No one's written a book about it.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.080]   There's no website.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.600]   There's no institute or anything about it.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.440]   But I have done extensive research in Brown's Gas.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.520]   And I compiled a page on my blog that lists every possible clinical study.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.600]   I can find every study, I can find specific to Brown's Gas.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.920]   I've also done videos about the specifics of Brown Gas and what makes it unique.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.000]   It's not just combining hydrogen and oxygen, there's a lot more going on.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.640]   And so there's actually the link to the video description, in the video description, is a
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.000]   link to my page on my blog where you can access all the research that I've been able
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.400]   to collect on Brown's Gas.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.600]   It seems to be the only place.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.440]   There are some vendors who sell Brown's Gas generators, who have research links in their
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.440]   websites.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.980]   And so those are good places to go to if you want to research Brown's Gas.
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:11.400]   But the other three heavily researched institutes exist in tons and tons of studies.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.600]   So now here's the high level summary of what these things do.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.920]   So right off the bat, what are the benefits of hydrogen therapy?
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.480]   And so now one of the things, hydrogen is an inert gas with no known side effects.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:34.680]   Now it's an antioxidant, it's an anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptic has anti-apoptic effects.
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.960]   I hope I pronounced that right, I practiced that for like 10 minutes here.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.560]   Now the study suggests that H2 may have the following benefits, and now there's a lot
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.560]   of different benefits.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.920]   Won't read you the whole slide.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.000]   But the bottom line though is it's really beneficial for cardio-protective, especially
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.040]   in the anti-inflammatory, and then it also does, it reduces smooth muscle cell proliferation
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:01.280]   and increases vascular density, chronic inflammation, prevention of renal injury, you know, all
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.120]   this, these incredible things that it does.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:09.000]   And one of the things that it does, it has, it can actually convert epigenetic markers
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   in your body.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.680]   And what that means is that not only does it heal, it helps your body heal, it also
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.240]   has its own properties and it goes after toxins.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.720]   It's an electron donor, if you understand, electron donors, and electron stealers, toxins,
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.320]   pathogens, bad stuff is electron stealers.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.480]   They come in your body and they start grabbing electrons off of your molecules that causes
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.200]   inflammation and damage.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.800]   And then you take anti-inflammatories which are electron donors that go and then basically
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.680]   neutralize all the toxins and pathogens, right?
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.160]   That's what anti-inflammatories do.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.280]   And so now this is like hydrogen literally is like the super, super ultimate anti-inflammatory
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.240]   supplement you could take, it's even better than C60 in terms of because if its size is
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.760]   so much smaller, it can go anywhere in your body.
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.080]   And so it is just this amazing anti-inflammatory thing.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.960]   But because it affects epigenetic markers in your body, it really, really can help you
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:09.280]   regulate something called autophagy which is your body's ability to get rid of old nastasin
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.800]   or senescent cells in your body, you know, cells that, you know, they make a copy of
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.000]   a copy as a regenerate.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.040]   And after a while, you know, making a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy, you know, these
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.520]   cells get mutated and damaged and then they're just, you know, they're just not, they're
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.880]   alive, but they're not doing what they're supposed to do and your body tries to flush
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:30.280]   them out through this process called autophagy and what this gas does is it actually helps
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.280]   do that.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.080]   And so these are just some of the incredible benefits of hydrogen and, you know, it's just
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.280]   one of the amazing super gases of our time and it's amazing how many people have it really
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.920]   kind of, you know, kind of latched onto this as a therapy because it is so super helpful
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.920]   for you.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.840]   Now the next one here is oxygen therapy and you'd kind of just like, you know, common
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:54.700]   sense, what is, what is oxygen and oxygen's primary benefit to us and obviously we all
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:00.400]   need it, but the primary benefit is for people who have lung problems and it's really, really,
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.720]   really helpful in that regard.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.920]   And so one of the things about oxygen therapy, you know, definitely can help people feel
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.000]   better, stay active because they get more oxygen, you know, for people that are have
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.160]   a problem, you know, in terms of just basically getting enough oxygen in through their lungs,
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.000]   you know, and that causes all sorts of problems if they can't.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.720]   So giving people like that oxygen therapy, super helpful, you know, obviously decreases
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.120]   shortness of breath and it also helps lung disease patients feel less breathless, you
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:34.400]   know, but it also acts as a tissue damage and, and it helps with, you know, tissue damage
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.640]   and death, you know, associated radiation, it really helps with wounds.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.480]   It's been used to treat flesh eating bacteria and carbon monoxide poisoning, decompression
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.680]   sickness and all sorts of different things.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.040]   And it actually is really good for skin grafts.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.640]   If you've ever had a severe boon, I mean, burn, sorry, you know, they can use oxygen,
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.840]   they can bag your arm or whatever area is burned and they just pump oxygen into it.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:02.760]   And that's really helpful for, you know, in terms of wound healing and tissue regeneration.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:09.480]   So it is one of the primary tools that, you know, you'll see using the clinical setting
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.400]   whenever someone comes in and they've got, you know, obviously lung problems, breathing
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.720]   problems and so forth.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.640]   So oxygen in itself is super helpful, you know, our bodies need it.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.240]   Our bodies also need hydrogen, you know, that's where hydrogen is a natural byproduct of fiber
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.240]   that you eat.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.480]   I don't know if you knew that.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.080]   If you, when you ever eat fiber, it goes into your gut, your gut microbiome starts, you
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.720]   know, just chomping away on it.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.660]   And then the output of that is hydrogen, it just, you know, that your gut microbiome
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.760]   produces the hydrogen your body needs.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.000]   And if you don't have enough fiber, then you're hydrogen deficient.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Guess what?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.520]   Everybody's hydrogen deficient because they don't get enough fiber.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.720]   Anyway, so now the next one is ozone.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.200]   Now ozone is really unique.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.480]   It's very different than the other three because you just, you cannot breathe it.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.480]   Okay.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.240]   It's really has extremely strong oxidation effect.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:04.040]   And so in the industry world, it's awesome for getting rid of odors and eliminating mold
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.000]   and all of those kinds of things, but, you know, so that's why you never can breathe
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   this.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.400]   There are people out in the ozone sphere that say you can breathe it if you bubble it through
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.480]   oil first, but I've never tried it.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.920]   And I still, it's just to me, it's like, you know, it's just one of those red flags.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.920]   Don't ever do that.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.800]   However, however, you know, there are people that say you can power to them, let them give
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.920]   it a try, you know, but, you know, and that's kind of out there for debate.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.680]   However, now the other ways you could take ozone, though, obviously you bubble it in
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.280]   water and there's other ways to apply it to yourself.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.360]   So the idea of ozone therapy, it was introduced in the United States in the early 80s.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.160]   It's been used in Europe far longer than that.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.200]   There, I mean, there's all these, you know, the governing bodies that have been working
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.320]   with ozone for a long time.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.120]   And what they found in the science studies using ozone is that it activates the immune
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.760]   system for infectious diseases because it's all, it's kind of a form.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.720]   It is definitely a form of oxygen therapy, but it's got that extra little atom, right?
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.260]   And so when that extra atom gets loose in your body, it does extra stuff in oxygen, just
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.660]   won't do by itself.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.580]   So you know, one of the other things that's found to do is it improves cellular utilization
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:16.660]   of oxygen for cardiac diseases or it release of growth factors, stimulates damaged joints.
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:21.200]   And that's one of the most interesting things when you start watching videos about these
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.040]   individual therapies.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:28.060]   One of the things you'll see is a lot of periodontists use ozone for like, you know, basically
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.700]   cleaning out cavities in your mouth, disinfecting the mouth, you know, that sort of thing.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:38.340]   And then also you'll find a lot of orthopedics will do injections of ozone into joints.
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.800]   And they have this incredible regenerative effect for not only helping your knees or
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.640]   your joints heal, but also, you know, in terms of helping the wound healers faster as well.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:52.420]   So you'll see a lot of different medical practitioners using ozone on those regards.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.360]   But also too, you can also use it in a way called IBO where you can actually then, you
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.800]   know, use it to get rid of pathogens in your bloodstream.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.080]   So something that nobody does with hydrogen or oxygen.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.880]   So ozone has its own unique little world going on in terms of its ability to help everything
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:14.440]   from allergies, arthritis, asthma, cancer, you know, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, you
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.520]   know, heart disease, infections, Lyme.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:25.320]   So ozone probably above the other two or three gases is definitely the more pronounced
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:31.760]   healing gas that you would use to just get rid of pathogens, help your body regenerate,
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:37.200]   help your body heal and eliminate all the infections and problem areas that you're having
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.200]   issues with.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:43.760]   And so, you know, I had an interesting interview last week with Dr. Nadine Johnson's a naturopathic
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:44.840]   physician.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.480]   And you know, she was mentioning to me that, you know, one-third of the patients she gets
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.720]   and she's been in practice for decades, you know, come from just people who are aware,
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.540]   they're self-aware, they've done their research, they know what help, you know, the quote,
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:03.680]   you know, the, what, what I guess the modern medicine people like to call alternative.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.400]   I call traditional because it's been around for much longer, but people that are more traditional
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.680]   organic minded, you know, we'll go out and seek out naturopath, but two-thirds end up
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.520]   with naturopaths because they're just frustrated and fed up with the medical system.
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.920]   And if that's you, then this is something you definitely want to consider because if
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.120]   you haven't gotten any results from, you know, like whether you've got, you know, problems
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.920]   with your knees, problems with pain, problems with fibromyalgia, I hope I'm pronouncing that
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.720]   one right, you know, all of those kinds of problems.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.240]   And if you just haven't had any success because of all the pills you're getting prescribed
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.800]   and all this stuff they're making you do, if you haven't tried ozone, you might want
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.280]   to think about it and give it a try.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.280]   Okay.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.720]   So, because it's, it's kind of like the wonder gas for those types of things.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.480]   Now, the next thing is, again, the brown's gas and so I just wanted to kind of point
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.400]   out again that it's really only, only been discovered that it was useful for health up
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:01.400]   till then that it's actually been used with cars, getting better gas mileage as well as
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.320]   used as a gas for welding.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.860]   But up around 2006, it was discovered that it had health benefits as well.
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.040]   And it's, it is a little unique.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.740]   You know, I've done videos on it separately, what, in terms of what makes it unique, like
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.600]   again, it's not just a combination of the two, but there's a lot more going on because
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.120]   of the way that the gas is, is actually generated.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.680]   Now, I was only able to find one study.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:29.560]   It's on my blog where it was successfully treated COVID-19 patients.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:34.160]   And so that's the only study so far that's specific to brown's gas out there in the world.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.480]   It is really quite new.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.840]   And so most of the information about brown's gas in terms of its benefits have come from
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:48.400]   user reports who have reported tons of different successes that have been equal to, if not
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.560]   better than H2O2 and O3 combined.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.520]   And that's what makes it so interesting to me.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.800]   That's why I got into it.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:00.800]   And just as a side note, to me, one of the incredible benefits of brown's gas, I've been,
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:06.240]   I've been inhaling and drinking bubbled water with brown's gas in it for five years now.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.640]   Is that prior to those five years, I was a lifetime asthmatic, you know, so asthmatic.
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.960]   And so I've just, you know, I, you know, I'm typical asthmatic, you know, used to carry
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:20.040]   around a puffer, had a, had a peak kick, a little device where I have to take the peak
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.040]   kick.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.160]   Not so bad that I had to be on nebulizers, but the whole idea though is that I suffered
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.000]   from asthma my entire life.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.760]   And I had all the different prescriptions and I always had to get them refilled, always
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.760]   had to carry these things around, always had problems, had bronchitis dozens of times,
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.560]   had pneumonia four times, you know, it's just always had major lung problems.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:48.680]   And then after starting brown's gas five years ago, I have not had an attack once in five
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   years.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.920]   And you know, for asthmatic to say they haven't had an attack in five years is, is, is miraculous
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.920]   actually.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.400]   And, and, and, and, and I just want to disclaimer here that I actually, my smoke cigars.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.400]   I love cigars.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.400]   It's my thing.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.160]   I've been smoking them since I was a teenager, not crazy, like George Burns, but you know,
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.880]   I enjoy a cigar, a daily, a day.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:14.840]   And so, you know, I still smoke cigars and yeah, certainly wasn't helping my asthma up
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.120]   until five years ago, but you know, honestly, I still have a cigar a day.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.200]   I'm still asthmatic and haven't had an attack.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.120]   So there's my little personal testimony there about brown skies.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:29.520]   So now to kind of summarize these benefits, okay, as it kind of comes into these three
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.640]   major areas of benefits, there's this health aspect.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.400]   We're just doing it just for the heck of it, you know, just in helping your health, helping
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.800]   you, you feel better, helping all the different, you know, like let's say you're in good
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.680]   health, but you just want to maintain your health or get healthy or then it, you know,
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.280]   these gases are remarkable for that.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.000]   There's also the benefit of healing again, as I mentioned and also that anti-aging aspect.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   So now the thing about these three key attributes of the gases and from the research that I
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.400]   have gone through is I just want to point out that in the area of just health and healing
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.800]   ozone and oxygen therapy seem to be that's there.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.800]   That's their thing.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.480]   That's where they really shine.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:13.240]   If you are looking at an alternative, you're tired of, you know, like not seeing any improvement
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.560]   or you're just a DIY or a self-sufficient character and you just want to take charge
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.640]   of your own health, be your own healer, kudos to you and you've got health and healing issues
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.480]   and that's your priority, that's your, you know, that's how I got into it too, I got
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:33.480]   into it because I just wanted to try an alternative to pain management and so I got into ozone,
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:38.280]   you know, and also for healing in terms of it's part of the Bob Beck protocol if you
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.280]   ever heard of that.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:44.400]   So, but ozone and oxygen work really well in this world of health and healing.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.200]   And then, but in terms of like a super gas, it's where I see hydrogen and browns gas really
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.200]   come into play where it really touches all three and it really shines for all three where
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.760]   you've got this third component of anti-aging where it becomes the superstar in terms of
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:03.400]   gas, for gas therapy and that's where for those of you who actually are interested in
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.920]   this extra component of anti-aging, helping your body, you know, slow down the ravages
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:14.720]   of what causes you to age, then it's this extra thing where not only does hydrogen and
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:21.760]   browns gas really really come into play with health and also healing but also to anti-aging,
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:25.040]   so that's kind of where I kind of place the star here in the middle where I think that,
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.720]   you know, I think it's the super gas really at the end of the day when reading all the
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.720]   various research.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.620]   So, now, obviously you've got questions right now, if that's any interest to you and you're
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.640]   like, yeah, you know, I'm kind of, I want to try it, you know, or I've been trying it
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.240]   or I want to try something else.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.240]   So here's the thing.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.160]   Now, how do you experience gas therapy?
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.960]   So if you wanted, if you've never done any of this, you've never even heard of gas therapy,
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.240]   not a surprise because, you know, most doctors just want to prescribe you medication.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.400]   However, if you wanted to try something different, now how would you do it?
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.440]   Now, in a clinical setting, you know, dug around, spend some time searching the internet.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.680]   Now obviously, you can get clinical setting, you can have oxygen in a clinical setting,
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.680]   you can have ozone in a clinical setting, there are physicians out there that do those
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:12.360]   therapies in their clinics and that's just a no-brainer, you can find that anywhere.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.680]   But I really was hard-pressed to find any clinical settings for hydrogen.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.840]   Now, I do know that they actually use it, but whether or not you can, you know, it can
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.840]   get prescribed, you can go out and find a doctor that does it, I'm a big question mark
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.840]   there.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.640]   I wasn't able to readily find anything in the clinical area for hydrogen therapy and
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:35.200]   there was nothing for their browns gas therapy in the clinical setting, it's just too new,
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.200]   no one's doing it.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:42.000]   Now, in a commercial setting, you know, you've probably seen, you know, articles, news articles
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.120]   and things like that and stories about hydrogen bars, you know, especially it's kind of a
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.400]   big thing in Japan.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.040]   And there are some, I do know of some in the United States, where they've got hydrogen
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.000]   bars where, you know, basically it's a commercial setting outside of the medical practice where
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.040]   you can just go and just sit there and breathe hydrogen while you're having a little water
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.040]   or whatever.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.600]   And then same thing they have in those hydrogen bars, usually you have oxygen bars and so
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:08.440]   you can kind of go in and kind of just, you know, inhale oxygen or inhale hydrogen while
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.920]   you're sitting in a commercial setting like that.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.320]   Now, I don't know, I didn't find anything where it was like, you know, ozone bar, anything
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.320]   like that.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.760]   So, ozone is pretty much in the clinical world, but in commercial world, you know, if you
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.080]   can like look in your city, you may end up, there might actually be hydrogen bar in your
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.120]   city where you can go and actually, you know, experience hydrogen or oxygen therapy right
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.320]   there in a commercial setting.
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.480]   Brown's gas, again, nothing in that area.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:36.080]   But now for the thing about it now, for me, I'm a big DIY, you know, I may be your own
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.400]   healer guy.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.680]   And so as a, as my own healer, you know, definitely there are home options for all four
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:46.480]   of these, and I actually do brown's gas and ozone for myself, I've got generators for
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.480]   that.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:52.480]   Now, in the home environment, you can easily experience hydrogen by, you know, you can
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:57.320]   buy tablets that dissolve in water, that bubbles the hydrogen in the water.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.000]   You can buy tanks of oxygen, you know, that are readily available.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.920]   You can even get them on Amazon or then you could get a generator and all of them.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.400]   You can have generator that'll generate the gas, all four of them.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.920]   And then for oxygen specifically, you can get a concentrator, which, you know, basically,
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.560]   there's no such thing as an oxygen generator, it's called an oxygen concentrator.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.720]   And so these are all in, you know, you see those ads, you know, ARP, you know, the little
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.960]   ladies got the little packet thing or the little, you know, tag a long thing on a stroller,
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.600]   you know, oxygen concentrators, and that's what a lot of the elderly folks you see in
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:35.080]   those commercials are, they're dragging around as an oxygen concentrator, so they can have
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.080]   oxygen.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.040]   But that's the idea, though, for home use is that you can have tablets and tanks and
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.880]   generators and concentrators, and it's absolutely 100% doable at home.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.600]   Now the thing about using it at home, though, and I just want to point out that, you know,
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.000]   there are accessories involved.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.240]   And so the accessories that, you know, basically is, you know, you'd have to buy a cannula for
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.120]   the breathing, no big deal on water and glasses, obviously.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:03.280]   But I do want to point out that with hydrogen and oxygen and browns gas, you know, it's
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:07.680]   pretty straightforward, you know, you're going to be breathing them.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.520]   You'll have a cannula, if you're going to be drinking it, you'll have bubble of water
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.520]   in a glass.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.720]   But the thing about, if you wanted to go beyond that, you don't want to go beyond that in
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.840]   terms of taking dosages, there's a lot of accessories that come along with these things.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.280]   And that's something to keep in mind.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.680]   So if you wanted to, let's say, you know, what are my dosing options for gas therapy?
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.520]   Well, right off the bat, now there's inhalation, again, I covered that water, covered that,
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.520]   and the others.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.200]   And this is where it comes into play, where there's all these accessories, right?
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.560]   So now, if you wanted to, you know, do it at home, no problem, absolutely possible.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.360]   But the other thing about the accessories, though, is when you get into the other, you
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:49.520]   know, so if you want to do, you know, inhalation, and then you want to bubble water, now here's
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.480]   some of the research benefits, the research indications, right?
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:25:00.800]   A therapeutic, here's an example, a therapeutic dose of hydrogen is bubbling the water with
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.720]   a, you know, one way or another tablets or a bottle or, you know, a generator, you bubble
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:10.360]   hydrogen in a water, but you need to drink about 1.5 liters per day for, quote, therapeutic
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.960]   dose per this study.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.240]   Now, also from the inhalation standpoint, you know, like if you're sitting on the couch
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.840]   or you're working at home or even in the office, you can set up a little generator and put
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.960]   up a cannula, you look weird, but hey, you know, you're doing it for your health.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:28.680]   And so you can basically take in inhalation and water, but the inhalation is like at minimum
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.440]   four hours a day and you space that out, you know, throughout the day.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.800]   So you know, breathing it in and drinking bubbled water is usually the medical approach,
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.160]   you know, as opposed to a non-medical approach in terms of, you know, trying to experience
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.240]   the benefits of the studies that have been put out there and, you know, everything that
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.680]   I mentioned earlier.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.200]   So you want to do inhalation and water and basic, that's my recommendation, you know,
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.560]   not one or the other because there's, you know, there are studies that do one or the
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.720]   other, but the bottom line at the end of the day, the summary is that if you do both
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.260]   at the same time, that's where you get the best bang for your buck.
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:06.720]   Now that other stuff, right, is other is you can do, you can experience or dose the gases
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.520]   topically through your skin.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.440]   And so now you can do that with all of the gases by bagging.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:19.200]   And so the thing about bagging is, you know, those plastic bags you put over casts, yeah,
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.880]   you just get some of those, you can do that with hydrogen and browns gas and oxygen, okay,
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.960]   do that with those on, there's a reason I'll give you, give me a second.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.960]   But the, if you want to just bag, you just get one of those bags, you put the tube in
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.880]   the bag and it fills up and then you just sit there for 20, 30 minutes while you're
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:38.800]   just basically concentrating that gas, you know, you know, wherever on your body you
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.320]   want, bagging obviously is typically for arms and legs.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:47.000]   Now, if you, if it's like somewhere on your torso, you can have a cup, there's a thing,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.880]   there's cupping where you can get cups and you can pump the gas into the cup and you
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.600]   can like literally hold the cup over a wounded area, you know, like, like, let's say you're
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.960]   trying to heal a surgical wound or you got a burn or that sort of thing, you can cup
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.960]   over it.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.840]   And now with hydrogen and browns gas, you know, you can pretty much use anything, you
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:08.240]   can use a silicone dog bowl for, you know, as simple as that, you just poke a hole in
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.440]   and get that, you know, get that gas going into that, into that cup.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.440]   And there's also the idea of submersion.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.880]   Now, submersion is basically, you know, sitting in a tub with that, with the gas bubbling
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.760]   through the tub. And the thing about that is it's really difficult because that much
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:31.280]   water to get the medical dose of the gas within that water requires quite a large generator.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.520]   And then there are actual generators out there.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:39.320]   And there's only one of that I know of that you hook up to your generator, right? So you
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:45.320]   take a nano bubbler, you hook up to a generator and you put the bubblers in the water, you
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:49.800]   can literally take a hydrogen bath. But you have to have this nano bubbler thing to just
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:55.520]   kind of basically, you know, pump enough gas in there, it's in a nano bubble state for
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.800]   you to be able to benefit, you know, from a submersion dosage, right?
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.480]   There's also the idea of hyperbaric. Now oxygen, as you know, you know, from all the
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.960]   old days, you know, back in the way, you know, like 100 years ago, there was that whole big
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:13.560]   polio epidemic and everybody ended up in, in hyperbar, hyperbaric chambers. And now it's
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:19.160]   used as a medical treatment. So you can actually get hyperbaric treatment with oxygen, which
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.240]   is, which is basically pressurized, you got to put you in a can with your head sticking
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.960]   out. And they just increase the pressure and pump an oxygen and the oxygen is literally
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:34.920]   infused into your body through pressure. And they only do that with oxygen from my, from
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.440]   my research. And now I don't know of any hyperbaric ozone, but you can also get like
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.360]   a little tent, you know, like those little spa tents and you stick your head out. And you
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:48.000]   can pump in ozone and you can get a full body ozone treatment that way. Let's say if you've
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.760]   got issues with your skin, you want to do your whole body at one point. So you can definitely
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.560]   do that type of an approach, but it's not hyperbaric, it's not pressurized. And so that's
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:01.120]   another way to actually do it at home. You could, these are all home ways to do it, you
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:06.840]   know, do it at home DIY. Now there's a process with ozone called Ibu and they don't do this
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:12.200]   with any of the other gasses, oh, it's specific to ozone. Now Ibu is where they basically,
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.840]   you go into a clinical setting and they take your blood out of you, they run it through
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:21.400]   an ozone machine, and they basically pump ozone into your blood, right? And they pump
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:25.440]   it back into you. And so for those of you who don't mind having your blood, you know,
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:31.320]   go on a field trip and then come back later on as it gets treated outside of your body,
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:36.560]   then it's been found to be extremely beneficial for your health. If that's something you're
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:42.640]   into, there's also insufflation, which is the, and this has been quite, you know, I mean,
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:48.720]   I'm not someone who does stuff like this, but insufflation is been a, it's written in
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:54.760]   the literature that it's just incredibly beneficial for digestion or primarily not digesting,
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.800]   but the next level down, you know, in terms of everything's going on in your colon and
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:04.680]   your intestines, because it just pumps all of the ozone up into your bottom half of your
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:10.360]   body through your rectum, and then basically just treats anything. So if people with leaky
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.560]   gut, IBS, you name it, you know, find a lot of benefit from insufflation in terms of pumping
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:20.920]   ozone up your behind. Okay, so that's another way to do it. You can do it at home, you know,
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.880]   the privacy of your own home, which probably would be best. And so that's really, you
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.360]   know, there's, so there's lots of different options. And I kind of wanted to point those
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.560]   out to you in terms of doing it yourself at home, different gases. And there are obviously
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:37.440]   certain things that I want to caution about is that hydrogen oxygen and browns gas are
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:43.120]   extremely flammable. And so now all of the commercial products that are sold in the United
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:49.920]   States by United States manufacturers. Okay, now they have included in them that I've seen,
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:56.440]   you know, have a lot have not a lot, but they have all of the safety features built into
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:04.240]   them so you don't blow yourself up. And that is incredibly important, as you can imagine.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.080]   And so one of the more incredible important pieces to it, they've got, they've got, you
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:14.120]   know, basically little switches in them and little levers inside of them so that it monitors
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:19.200]   and minimizes the amount of the gas that's kind of come in and mixed with ambient air
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.360]   as you're breathing it so that you're only getting the correct dosage, but not so much
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:29.000]   that it could be flammable. Right. So it's usually around 4% so if you're taking in 4%
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.240]   hydrogen or oxygen or browns gas, it's mixing with the air as you're breathing. Okay, you've
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.440]   just got the cannula in your nose and your breathing so you're getting the gas, but you're
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:43.500]   not getting 100% of what your breathing is not the gas. Okay, that's not works. So you're
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:48.840]   just breathing in some of it. So as it's being pumped into your, you know, into your nose,
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.200]   you're also breathing in outside air. And so at the end of the day, you're getting about
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:58.000]   a 4% mixture, which is safe. And then if it happens to come anywhere near a spark or
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.820]   anything like that, you know, your lungs won't blow. And also the, you know, the flame won't
[00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:08.240]   go into the generator and below the tank. So there's these safety features are critical.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.280]   And that's why if you're going to go out and get a product, you want to really look
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:16.700]   at the safety features. And you know, there are a lot of folks that go and build their
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:21.360]   own browns gas generators, their own hydrogen generators. Well, yeah, that's great. And
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:25.200]   you can do it and you get that's then if that works for you, but if you're doing a build
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:31.000]   your own thing, and if you don't have your, your, your, you know, attention spent on the
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.280]   safety features, yeah, that's very, very dangerous. And I do not recommend doing that unless you
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:40.720]   know what you're doing. So I prefer to go to the experts who build these things and,
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.200]   you know, they warranty them and they know what they're doing so that they make them
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:51.680]   safe. Now the other thing too about topical is that while you can bag, you know, hydrogen
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:56.160]   and browns gas and so forth, you got to be aware that once you concentrated into kind
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:03.160]   of this bag, you got to be extremely careful about flames and sparks. So, you know, if
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:08.400]   you've got the high static electricity going on in your home, not recommended, you know,
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.240]   so you got to be really attuned to the idea that this thing, you know, that these when
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:18.200]   you accumulate that gas, the generator is safe. We're using the generator, you're safe. But
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:24.280]   if you accumulate it in a bag, and I do all the time, then I have to be really cautious
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:29.040]   about, you know, is there high static electricity right now in the house? You know, so turn
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:34.520]   on the humidifier, you know, turn in the base that eliminates static electricity or, you
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.840]   know, or just making sure that, you know, there's no flames anywhere around me because
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:43.080]   it, you know, that bag will go off. And if you've ever seen the documentary about Hindenburg,
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.200]   yeah, you'll, you know, you'll know what I'm talking about. So caution there because
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.120]   some of these gases are quite flammable. ozone, not an issue. And then the last thing about
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:57.200]   that ozone about bagging is ozone is extremely corrosive. Okay. And so you can't just go
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.000]   and buy a regular bag off Amazon. And even the tubing that you're using all has to be
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.800]   silicone has to be special bags. So if you want to do ozone bagging, which again is incredible
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:13.440]   healthy benefit. And that sort of thing, you need to go to a place that sells bags just
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:18.400]   for ozone. And they're this special kind of plastic polymer that won't deteriorate.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.760]   And then all the cupping things are glass. So ozone, it's its own little world when it
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.360]   comes to topical. But if you do it right and you get the right equipment, you won't, you
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:30.920]   know, your equipment will last you a long time. Okay. So there's that. Now the last
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.920]   thing I want to do cover is like, Hey, what do you know, what's the stuff cost if I wanted
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:40.440]   to do this stuff? And so now, again, if you just want to do inhalation, there are devices
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:45.880]   out there that only, you know, that you can just do inhalation for hydrogen and oxygen,
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:51.080]   or you can just do water or both, right? And now brownscast generators are both are all
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.800]   of them are both you can do water and inhalation with both. Again, you don't do inhalation
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:00.640]   with ozone, but you can bubble the water. Okay. And also you can do all the other stuff
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:04.600]   you can bag and you name it. And so the costs here, now, if you just wanted to get into
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:09.480]   hydrogen with a generator like a hydrogen generator, it's as low as $800 and they go
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:15.120]   all the way up to like $2,500 for, you know, for home use. Now if you wanted to get a water,
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.680]   you know, hydrogen generator, you can get a $300 water bottle. It's an actual bottle
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.680]   with a little thing on the bottom that produces hydrogen gas, or you can go all the way up
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:27.520]   to the $1,500 hydrogen pitchers, you know, if you just want to do hydrogen water. Now
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.320]   if you get a generator, it does both. Now the other here in the world of hydrogen again
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:36.480]   as those tablets, and they usually run about 50 bucks a bottle. Now for oxygen, you can
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:43.840]   get tanks, oxygen concentrators, and oxygen tanks that are anywhere from 550 to 1500,
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.080]   for both types of different devices. So you can just get, you know, like a tank oxygen
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.800]   or an oxygen concentrator, which then you could use to bubble water as well. So you're
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:56.440]   looking at 550 to 1500 investment. And then of course other is, you know, they got these
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:00.560]   little throwaway tanks you can buy now that just give you like a boost of oxygen. So let's
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.760]   say you're out hiking and you know, you're going to go real high elevation, you can bring
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:07.240]   a little tank and you can just sit there and just, you know, take a few hits of oxygen
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.880]   while you're up there high and you're, you know, you're hiking and you're out of breath.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:15.000]   So that's kind of what people do now. They just carry oxygen with them. Now I'm not talking
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.960]   like, you know, Mount Everest or anything. I'm just talking normal people, normal, you
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:23.560]   know, normal hiking. Now ozone, basically, they're just generators. They do, they just
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.680]   generate and bubble water or they do that in suffocation. In sufflation, like I mentioned,
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:33.720]   you can't do EBO at home, by the way, there's no EBO at home. You can't have your blood
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:38.120]   taken out. You've got to go to a clinic for that. But if you just wanted to do insufflation
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:43.000]   or you want to do cupping or you want to bubble water with ozone, then those ozone generators
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.320]   run anywhere from 850 to 1500. Plus, you know, you're going to be buying some accessories,
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.440]   you're going to buy the cups and bags and the tubes and all of that stuff that goes
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:54.600]   with it. But it, you know, in my mind, it's worth it. I've actually got, I have both, you know,
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:59.240]   I've got ozone generator, I've got browns gas generator and so forth. And then again,
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:06.600]   browns gas generators, they do run about 2000 to 2700 who that does both. Okay, inhalation
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.680]   and water. So I kind of wanted to kind of show you just some information here. So let's say
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.640]   if you go on Amazon, you know, you can see the picture that I mentioned, here's a hydrogen water
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:21.960]   pitcher or hydrogen water bottle or a hydrogen generator. Like these little guys, these little
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:27.160]   hydrogen generators like this, like this was not even bad price. You know, like $369, I guess,
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.440]   I guess I'm wrong. But that's kind of the price of these generators. So of course,
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.800]   there's all these different bottles, pitchers, and little generators and so forth. That'll
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:43.480]   actually give you that. Now, if you get into the oxygen generator, when you get into the oxygen
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.640]   generators, you're going to find pretty much like these little throwaway tanks that I was mentioning
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.720]   and concentrators and things like that. But then here's the like, here's an here, I don't know,
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:56.440]   I threw in an ozone generator here. So this is an ozone generator. This is actually the model I
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:02.200]   have. So I bought this years ago and I connected and I took an oxygen generator, I'm sorry, an
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:09.880]   oxygen concentrator. And I plugged it into my ozone generator and then produced what they
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:15.560]   call medical grade ozone. Okay. And that's what I use for ozone. Now this other device right here
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:21.720]   is in actual, they call it an ozone generator, but it's not for medical purposes. There's no,
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.680]   you can't connect a tube to this thing. It will not bubble water. What it's meant to do
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:34.520]   is to produce ozone in an open space. So like, let's say, if you have odor problems in your home or
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:39.400]   mold problems and things like that, you can just put this thing in there, turn it on and it'll kill
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:44.840]   everything in there. And that's what it does. And so, but yeah, definitely not. This is not a
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:49.800]   medical grade ozone generator, what you need to find for a medical grade ozone generator is you
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:56.680]   find one that has an oxygen input. Okay, because medical grade ozone is not the same as ozone from
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:02.440]   let's say a kitchen appliance. Let me see if I can find one here. Anyway, that's enough about
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:10.760]   the oxygen right tanks and concentrators. But when you start talking about ozone, ozone. Okay,
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:15.800]   there we go. Ozone generator. You get into these ozone generators like this one, but then you get
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:21.720]   into these guys right here. Now these are kitchen appliances. They're not, they don't have an input
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:27.080]   port for an oxygen. And the difference between the two is that a medical grade ozone generator will
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:33.320]   have an input for an oxygen source so that you're pumping oxygen in and the generator is making
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:39.880]   ozone from pure oxygen, which is different than these kitchen appliances here, which are basically
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:46.280]   pulling ambient air and then creating ozone with the ambient air. And so the output that it puts out
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:52.360]   has got nitrogen and helium and all these other gases in ambient air and, and, you know, hydrogen
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:59.880]   and, and ozone. So you can see the difference, right? Medical ozone is just ozone, you know,
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:07.080]   and oxygen. And then these kitchen appliances are ozone and everything else that's in the air
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:11.240]   that you're breathing. And so the difference between the two is that, you know, if you wanted to get
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:18.120]   medical results, medical ozone generator is the way you want to go. If you want to just use it for
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:23.800]   a kitchen appliance, which is great, by the way, for disinfecting produce, using it for, you know,
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.640]   anything, you can just, you know, use it for cleaning and you can just all sorts of different
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:33.000]   things. We're moving odors and so forth. These are the different ozone appliances you can use
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.920]   as kitchen appliances. And then you've got house appliances. And just as an example,
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:43.800]   my daughter went to University of Hawaii in Hilo. And Hilo is in a tropical rainforest and her how,
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:50.840]   and her car, she, when she came home for Christmas break three weeks, went back home to Hilo,
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:56.600]   her, her car turned into a chia pet. I mean, the inside of it, she said, was just absolutely
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:03.480]   filled with mold in just the three weeks she was gone. So I sent her an ozone generator. And so
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:08.520]   she put that thing in there and it just turned it on and left it in there for a while. This one of
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:12.680]   these little guys, and then it killed all the mold and then she just had to clean it up, you know,
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:18.360]   wipe it down. But it did a great job. Now I use these things to get rid of odors. Also,
[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.440]   I have one of these as well. So ozone getting rid of odors is awesome kitchen appliance. I
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:27.080]   actually have them all. I have this guy right here in my kitchen to clean my produce. I have one of
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.320]   these to get rid of the stinks that come up every now and then. And I have one of these. So,
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:37.480]   yeah, real big into ozone. Now in terms of hydrogen, as you notice, there's only that one hydrogen
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:43.000]   generator on Amazon that they were that this was right here, like this guy right here. So,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.400]   I'm not familiar with this guy because my go to just honestly is I go to hydrogen for health.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:56.040]   One of my my favorite sites for browns gas and hydrogen is this site is run by a guy named Steve
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:01.320]   Delvis, who's done a tremendously great job of just documenting everything. And this is his
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:06.520]   YouTube channel. He's just documented almost everything you could possibly ask for, you know,
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:11.720]   asked to want to know about hydrogen and browns gas and then different ways to use it and the
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:16.200]   different equipment that's available. So he's just really, really, really up on just making,
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:21.320]   you know, communicating and educating and so forth. And his site actually pretty he actually sells
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:26.520]   these these products. And so I actually bought mine. I bought one of mine from him. I actually
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:31.000]   threw up three of these three different browns gas generators. So I actually own the H2 life right
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.320]   here. And so I've been using this guy for five years. And I actually the reason I have more than
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:40.120]   one is I don't like lugging around the big one. So I have a big one next to my desk in my office,
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:45.080]   my home office. And then I've got this little guy who's next to the couch where I sit at night.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:50.120]   And so I just kind of inhale at night using my H2 life. And it works out just perfectly for me.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.920]   I get my full four to six hours a day of just inhalation by having, you know, generators in
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.720]   different places in my house. And I've also own bottles, but you know, I kind of switch from bottles
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:04.840]   to generators a while back. But this is the H2 life browns gas generator, which I own. And I
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:10.040]   swear by it, it works fantastic. And the customer service is exceptional. So that's kind of why,
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:14.280]   you know, I just really, really like hydrogen for help. Now they also sell like these little
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:20.200]   guys right here, which is, and these, by the way, these are all warranted and so forth. And with
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:25.000]   the highest quality of equipment, you can, and I want to state it out loud. Yeah, you can go on
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.440]   Ali Baba or Ali Express, and you can find Chinese knock offs. But I'll tell you what, if you talk
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:36.920]   to Steve, you will find out a great deal about the quality of the metal in them, and how long they
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.840]   last. And it's going to be one of those cheap knock off things that's going to, that's not going
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:45.560]   to last you very long. No customer service, no warranty. And that's why you're getting such a
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:50.440]   great deal. And so, you know, but it's a choice, right? But for me, I want to buy from someone I
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:56.680]   could talk to who stands by their products. And so Steve also sells hydrogen generators,
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:03.080]   like this little puppy right here for around 795. He's got the pitchers and so forth. And so, you know,
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:08.120]   really, really, really, you know, he's got all the accessories I talked about. And then he's got
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:13.960]   the hydrogen generators. Now the hydrogen generators that he sells are just top of the line high quality
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:19.240]   and so forth. And so, you know, on and on and on. But anyways, this is my go to. So if you had any
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:23.480]   questions about, you know, I want to get a hydrogen generator or a Brown's guest generator, you know,
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:27.160]   this is this is my go to and I just want to point it out to you. And also, if you want to learn
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:32.440]   anything more about that, oh, by the way, all the links in the video description. Here's a here's a
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:37.000]   link to the hydrogen for health YouTube channel. Okay, so you can kind of take a look at all the
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.040]   stuff that Steve has to say. Now my other one for ozone that I want to point out is my go to for
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:48.920]   ozone. Now before I really got into ozone, as I mentioned, I went to I went to Amazon and I bought
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:55.720]   a medical ozone generator and an oxygen concentrator. And then that was over 10 years ago. And so since
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:45:02.280]   that time, this site popped up and and it's been going strong for quite for all that time now.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:08.520]   And so in this this site right here is now become my go to. And specifically, I started coming to this
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:16.200]   site because one of the things that I discovered was that I needed all these accessories. I needed
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:21.320]   cups and I needed filters and so forth. And so I started buying my ozone glassware from this site.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:27.080]   Then I started buying my ozone, you know, all my ozone supplies. So I get all my ozone supplies
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:31.240]   here. I still have my other, you know, Amazon generator. But I'll tell you what, if I had to do
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:37.880]   it all over again, I would just go here. You know, for promo life is like the one stop shop for if
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:42.600]   you're into ozone or you want to try ozone in terms of their packages that they've got. So you
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:48.040]   can kind of get like here, they got like the starter package somewhere in here from a generator. And
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:53.480]   it comes with, you know, a few of the basic, you know, accessories you would want to get. So
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.160]   it's definitely something that you might want to consider if you're looking into getting ozone,
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:04.440]   checking out the promo life. And again, the thing about the promo life website that I like is not
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:09.640]   only do they have everything you could possibly imagine, including oxygen tanks, right? If you
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:15.560]   wanted to get oxygen for your medical grade or generator is also just like Steve over at hydrogen
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:20.760]   for health. You know, they are really big. And I like this about certain websites, you know,
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:25.240]   because certain websites, you know, you could tell the difference between, Hey, are they
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:30.200]   really into what they're doing? Are they subject matters in this stuff? Can they answer your
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.600]   questions and support their products? Do they quote know what they're really doing? Because they're
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:38.600]   selling you something you're going to use for your health? Well, when I see someone has a really
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:44.200]   deep YouTube channel and they spend a lot of time on customer education. You know, so just like
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:49.560]   Steve Dalvis at hydrogen for health, you could see how many hours of his life he spent on customer
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:55.000]   education and letting people know and be really transparent about the quality of his products.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.080]   Well, same thing with promo life. Promo life is the same one. That's why I like these two guys.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:04.200]   These guys are my go to and I trust them because of all this information they put out and how much
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:09.080]   of a subject matter expert they are in this area as opposed to some drop shipper, you know,
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:13.720]   or an Amazon site or even worse, you know, like Baba. So that's kind of why I'm making this
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:18.280]   recommendation. If you're interested in getting into ozone, I highly recommend it. It has been
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:22.760]   incredible for all the different things I've used for, you know, in terms of like wound healing
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:28.680]   and so forth. And then at the same time, this is be where I would recommend is a go to. You can
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:33.800]   take a look at every possible product he's made a video about, you know, the different packages he's
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:37.640]   got. And I also want to point out all the different ways you could use ozone based on the different
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:42.200]   videos he's made. So here's that sonic steam cabinet kind of thing that I mentioned, you could
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:48.040]   use with ozone, ozone shorts, he's got this ozone head bag. You don't want to pull it over your nose,
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:53.720]   but you can just if you had scalp issues, you could ozone your head, ozone, you know, all these
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:48:00.920]   different things he's got with ozone, ozone for, you can basically use it for your dental,
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:06.280]   you can use it for your ears, you name it. I mean, there's all this stuff you had ozone ears and
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:13.480]   sufflation, you know, all sorts of ways to treat your ozone in sufflation for your sinuses. It
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:20.200]   doesn't just have to be your behind your other holes will take ozone as well. The channel ozone
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:25.560]   in sufflation, if you've got issues with that, you know, in terms of infections and so forth.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:29.960]   But yeah, ozone is pretty amazing. And if you go to this guy's YouTube channel, you will find out
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:35.560]   all of the different ways you could use ozone to treat anything that's, you know, not almost
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:40.360]   anything that you've got issues with and you can how you can use ozone for it, how the product works
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:44.840]   and how to use the product. Same thing over here with hydrogen for health in terms of how to use
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:49.720]   the product about the product and answering all the questions you've got, which you never ever
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:54.200]   going to get from Amazon or Alibaba. So those are my two recommends that I want to point out to
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:59.480]   you guys. So and that's where the prices come from. So if you're interested in it, at the end of the
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:05.640]   day, any one of these is incredible. If you're into healing, if you want to have something in your
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:09.640]   house that can heal wounds and all sorts of stuff, because you don't want to take drugs,
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:13.800]   you know, and you don't want to deal with the out, you know, the health insurance and medical,
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:19.160]   get wait, forget an appointment, five minute visit thing, which I loathe. You just want to
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:24.120]   take care of yourself health and healing oxygen ozone is awesome for that. If you want to kick
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:30.840]   it up a notch, go to hydrogen and browns gas, either way, any one of these therapies using gas is
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:38.200]   with the medical literature out there, it is absolutely 100% validated. It works. It's incredibly
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:44.040]   great for you. The price isn't really that high, given how much it costs just to, you know, if you
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:48.760]   end up with a problem, how much you spend overall on pharmaceuticals, et cetera. So I just really
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:54.600]   want this is a real strong recommendation. As you probably have noted, you know, I because I use
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:59.320]   these gases myself, I'm a real strong proponent. Anyway, well, that's it for gas therapy and which
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:05.160]   one is right for you. It depends what your objective is, but there's definitely a gas that can help
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:11.080]   you with your health, your healing and anti-aging. There's also different ways you can do it. If you
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:14.600]   have any questions about the products and any of that kind of stuff, links in the video description.
