[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me, Kay Elmer and in
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.680]   this video I'd like to talk with you about Alt-C60 or as I'm referring to
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.160]   alternative C60 different ways that people are actually using C60 and in
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.920]   this video I'd like to talk about topical and do a product review on some
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.040]   of the topical products that are now on the market are about to be on the
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.560]   market that have that are centered around C60. So let's just jump in. First
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.480]   we've got some of our disclaimers. This material is for research purposes only.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.280]   C60 oil is not approved for consumption or topical application by the FDA.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.680]   You understand that making and using C60 oil is experimental and you do so at
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.000]   your own risk and I do not endorse products. I don't have a stake
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.960]   in any C60 company and I don't get paid in any way
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.400]   to make videos but I do want to make sure that I full disclosure
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.240]   that I did receive free samples of lotions and creams
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.800]   for this video so I just want to make it clear that I did get some free product
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.480]   because I wanted to show it in this video. So now the first thing I want to
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.200]   just kind of back up and I made a video about a year and a half ago or so
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.520]   about C60 topical and it all started with me spilling
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.280]   pulver IC60 on my skin and then realizing because I did that
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.720]   that you literally could absorb C60 through the skin
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.640]   and then I did some research and so forth and discovered
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.440]   that C60 had been used in the cosmetic industry since
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.680]   before the rat study where people actually got the idea to start taking
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.120]   it in oil. So it actually goes way back way back
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.200]   before the rat study and it's been used as a cosmetic.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.520]   It's been studied extensively as a topical
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.200]   much you know way before it was something you would ingest. So
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.320]   some of the research materials now I put links
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.200]   to a lot of the research for topical application of C60 in the video
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.800]   description for all of you that want to learn more about that
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.000]   but basically the summary or the bullet points here
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.360]   are that the benefits of C60 topically you know it's an antiviral
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.000]   anti-inflammatory anti-microbial antioxidant you know which everybody
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.840]   that's like the number one thing everybody knows
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.200]   but it's cytositoprotective cytotoxic
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.640]   so it it'll help you you know basically
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.320]   topically it'll basically protect you from toxins landing on your skin
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.600]   and then absorbing into your skin it's also photoprotective
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.440]   it has you know photomic properties that are
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.080]   very interesting which is sort of alludes to sunscreen but not necessarily
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.160]   that's a whole other subject I'm not going to go there
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.200]   but there's a research study on that it definitely does whitening and
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.960]   brightening anti-wrinkle for those of you who
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.680]   are you know think about that a lot acne improvement I got a personal story
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.920]   about that moisturizing it's poor tightening and it's also
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.360]   good for scalp care and hair growth so so
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.480]   you know it's pretty amazing that you know all this time everyone's always
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.040]   focused on on taking C60 oil but the idea of C60 being a topical
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.400]   although it's primarily been in the cosmetic industry
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.160]   and kind of buried within that not really prevalent in terms of like
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.280]   people are advertising heavily that oh we we are selling a C60 topical
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.280]   instead they're selling cosmetics we see 60 in it
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.000]   but now after a couple years of C60 being a
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.800]   little bit more popular it's now starting to bloom as a
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.360]   topical product that's centered around C60 so
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.960]   what we're now seeing in the market today instead of cosmetics with C60
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.840]   we're now seeing C60 actual products that are centered around C60
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.840]   marketed as C60 products and that's really really cool
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.640]   that's that's something that I thought was gonna happen
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.320]   and that's why I've done already I've already done two videos about
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.240]   C60 topical this is my third but now this is the third one
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.320]   I finally have products that people are making that I could show you folks that
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.040]   says hey yeah now it's taking off people are actually
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.080]   starting to make C60 topicals it's very exciting
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.880]   this is the year where it's really going to take off you know
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.600]   because there's so many products out there now I mean not so many but you
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.640]   know there's at least a half a dozen but what we're seeing right now
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.080]   obviously the topical products are people just simply you know it's just
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.160]   level set right well right off the bat I mean you really need to make a C60
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.400]   topical product why don't you just put the C60 oil on your skin and certainly
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.840]   that is definitely something that people are doing and they're getting
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.440]   great benefits from that so that's you know that's obviously
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.320]   you know that's like you know the ground level here
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.400]   of using C60 topical is you don't do need to do anything different
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.560]   you can just use the oil as it as it is right and I've got a
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.480]   great testimony coming up about that but also what's happening though is that
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.960]   people are making products they're making topical focused products
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.240]   with body lotions facial creams facial oil and even elixirs and so that's
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.480]   what's really really what the difference is now is that people are not just
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.440]   putting the oil on but they're actually there's actually
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.240]   skin products out there it's centered around C60
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.720]   so by the way you know I was on I just took coin up kind of point out how
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.480]   far back the cosmetic industry has been using C60
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.960]   I found a couple of old commercials from 11 and 12 years ago
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.000]   that are on YouTube so I kind of made this compilation
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.720]   to kind of show you how C60
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.000]   originally started in the cosmetic industry so
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.240]   this kind of gives you a little bit of an idea of what was promoted over a
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.000]   decade ago exposure to pollution and oxidizing free radicals
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.440]   which causes acne, aging, brown spots and wrinkles
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.960]   no one C60 uses radical sponge micro technology to eliminate reactive oxygen
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.160]   and damaging free radicals fully is shaped like a soccer ball
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.960]   therefore it is oftentimes referred to as
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.200]   soccering it acts like a sponge readily absorbing
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.800]   and helping to prevent against harmful free radicals
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.080]   so it is referred to as radical sponge RS as well
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.760]   full range C60 improves our body's metabolism
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.920]   and helps remove and repair free radicals caused by pollution in our
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.480]   environment stress and diets by reducing the amount of free
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.920]   radicals in our bodies we can slow down harmful chemical
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.400]   reactions in our bodies this will slow down aging
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.960]   full range is one of the most highly anticipated anti-aging agents
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.880]   and has an anti-aging effect 172 times that of vitamin C
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.600]   full range C60 is highly effective at repairing fine lines
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.840]   loose skin, dullness and spots commonly found in older looking skin
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.880]   boasting advanced water and oil technology
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.920]   full range C60 youth recruit complex also contains effective ingredients
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.800]   and rich extracts when the gel is smoothed over the skin
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.400]   it turns into water pearls allowing deep down diffusion of the active ingredients
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.440]   to the deepest skin layers the gel is completely absorbed into the skin
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:34.000]   in the quickest possible time leading the skin subtle and soft your skin will
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.800]   thank you all vegan so that kind of gives you an idea
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.080]   what the commercials were like back then and what's interesting is that they
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.520]   actually quote the 172 times vitamin C
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.800]   which was actually quoted in the in the rat study itself
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   so you know it really does go back really far
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.320]   in terms of the cosmetic industry but you like again you know what's really
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.000]   cool is that people are now making C60
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.040]   topical products as opposed to cosmetics but
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.880]   now the very first one that I kind of pointed out
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.880]   which was the C60 oil and you know I wanted to kind of share with you an
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:17.360]   example of someone using carbon 60 oil all of oil
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.640]   specifically the red lion brand which was
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.800]   what I used in this example so here's the story
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.120]   I got a friend of mine and he knows that I'm like quote the C60 guy
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.040]   I think he watches some of my C60 videos but for the most part
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.360]   he's not into C60 you know I am but you know he's just you know you have
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.400]   friends like that right there they don't necessarily share your
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.480]   your thing so he's kind of like on the peripheral of C60 understands it but
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.520]   you know not into it and so I kind of use my friends as guinea pigs sometimes
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.800]   so I'll make batches and I'll come up with different tinks and ideas and I'll
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.600]   send people stuff and go hey try this try that you know
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.560]   and so a few months ago I'll just call him W I sent W
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.920]   a couple of bottles of C60 one of them was a spare bottle of Red Lion which is
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.200]   exactly one of these Red Lion C60 in olive oil
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.640]   I sent him one of those I sent him C60 in I think it was coconut oil
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.680]   and I just you know I didn't even give him any instructions at all I mean before
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.200]   that I had sent him like a half a liter to try
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.400]   but I don't really give him any instructions because I just kind of want
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.480]   to see when I send samples out to my friends I just want to see what
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.480]   happens you know I don't really want to tell them
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.920]   I don't want to plant any ideas in their head about what to do with the oil
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.040]   I just go hey this is really great stuff go give this a try
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.120]   but I don't tell him how to try it so this is what was really interesting and
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.600]   this is why I want to share this with you today
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.320]   when it comes to C60 oil and specifically you know this one's Red Lion
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.000]   I gave him the two bottles I didn't tell him what to do with it and he kind of
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.560]   like didn't do anything for a couple of months so I forgot it
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.240]   I actually forgot that I gave it to him and then he went on this business trip
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.520]   and he does a vlog right and so he'll post like he'll talk
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:07.440]   about life and stuff and he does a vlog and and so he he I just kind of
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.040]   follow him on his vlog like he kind of follows me on my youtube channel
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.360]   and one day out of the blue you know I knew that he went to this business trip
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.160]   he lives in Columbus, Ohio but he went on a business trip to Las Vegas
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.600]   and while he was on the business trip he posted a vlog entry
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.160]   and this is without us talking to each other without me telling him anything
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.480]   just you know sending him a couple of bottles of C60 like months prior
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.840]   and so what I want to do is I want I just want you to hear it from the
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.760]   horse's mouth because his reaction to what he did
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.360]   using C60 topically was is just astonishing
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.360]   now I do say I got to let you know that the volume is really low
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.360]   on his video so you know I just want to give you a heads up you need to turn
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.480]   the volume up and then I'll give you a heads up to turn the volume down so
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.760]   you don't you know my voice doesn't blow your ears away but
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.400]   you know I really really want you guys to hear
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:06.160]   what he had to say from from his own words so here we go
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:13.360]   which he was a C60 experiment
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:21.840]   you usually just talk to five out of person but
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.720]   so I have some C60
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.600]   that when I got and I used it on skin elements because I have a lot of skin
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.920]   problems
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:47.520]   skin issues and a lot of the studies on C60 have been on skin
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.880]   yeah
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.400]   I have this rash
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.040]   that developed like
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.160]   eleven and twelve years ago and
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:14.080]   it just was warm and really won't ever go away for anything
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.680]   and I didn't think about it at all because I don't ever see it's like
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.520]   on my chest hidden
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.560]   and this isn't my chest but the struggle
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.280]   so I don't think about it much and then when I was here I was like oh
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.960]   hey gosh it's a C60 in that
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.760]   and it's gone
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.600]   what the fuck that was literally one time
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:44.480]   that's weird I mean that's the fastest although all my other skin
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:51.360]   for two burdens is C60 makes yeah it's pretty much any
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:58.400]   skin element uh that I have you know go away
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:05.120]   maybe that's amazing I'm trying to find another
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.080]   another skin problem
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:18.960]   oh I did oh another thing I tried it on
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.840]   and that worked too I just realized it too just you know standing here
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:29.280]   so I got corn it's from uh walking that much
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:36.960]   I've told you so the past days so uh two nights ago
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.720]   I covered my whole one on my foot let's see 60
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:49.280]   one of the corn's are I see it now I can't feel them now
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.360]   it's like just a stiffer oh my god
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.160]   oh shit
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.000]   that's actually impossible wait a minute
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.920]   let's see if there's something yeah yeah we're gone
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.680]   now if you've ever had corn walking you know they don't disappear
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.760]   after a day and I did walk yesterday I did go
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.640]   to convention yesterday too so there was more walking
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.640]   they're going oh shit so anyways that's two things
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.920]   for C60 own skin conditions
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.680]   now I just want to preface that with you know I didn't
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.920]   like again I I did not solicit this he just posted it you know just
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.040]   because it happened and you know to kind of reiterate
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.520]   um you know it's amazing I mean you know I actually kind of quizzed him about
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.320]   this and I got his permission to post his vlog entry
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.760]   uh for this video because I was like okay well you know
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.280]   how long did you have the rash and he said he had about nine years
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.640]   and that he had tried numerous different ointments from the drug
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.480]   store and nothing had helped his rash and in one night in one night
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.600]   putting red line all of uh C60 olive oil
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.800]   just it just went away and then of course he had applied it to his
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.240]   corns on his feet same issue had corns for years
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.680]   and again you know it went away and uh he is
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:18.000]   now a C60 uh at you know he's on board and now he understands why I'm
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.680]   obsessed about it C60 so you know it is an amazing testimony that I
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.600]   wanted to just give to you about using C60 oil
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.360]   topically just the oil itself if you haven't tried it yet and you've got a
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.760]   bottle next time you got a skin issue you know there you go so uh that's the
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.680]   first one that I wanted to share with you was C60 oil topically I think this
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:42.160]   was an amazing testimony and it just shows you the power of C60
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.760]   you know as uh as something that can help you
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.760]   with your skin okay now the other thing that I want to talk about this other
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.160]   product that's out there now it's a brand new product it hasn't launched yet
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:59.920]   it's C60 Labs has now is now making a C60 moisturizing lotion
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.480]   okay and so the basically the ingredients here it's just uh they they basically
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.360]   take C60 in coconut MCT oil at one to five ratio so it's
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.400]   20 percent of a two ounce bottle is going to be C60 and MCT oil
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.800]   all right and then they add collagen um aloe sorry
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.640]   and retinol and they make this uh make this lotion so
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.320]   I kind of did this little demo video to kind of show you
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.400]   um uh you know what this lotion looks like
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.640]   so the story behind this one uh this this lotion
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:42.160]   is that uh Dave at C60 Labs uh let me know that they started
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.800]   testing the C60 oil in different blends of lotion about two years
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.720]   ago and the challenge was to get the maximum amount of C60 oil
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.200]   into the lotion without making it feel too greasy to the touch
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.000]   and something that would dry relatively quickly
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.800]   and so last summer they found a small lotion cosmetic company
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.520]   that would work with them to find a solution
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.880]   and they started to include a free bottle with orders
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.120]   on their website so that they could get feedback from customers
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.400]   starting last fall and so that's kind of how I found out about it
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.880]   was you know this it's not even for sale yet you just get it for free
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:26.160]   whenever you buy a C60 Labs you know product and so I actually
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.040]   Dave sent me one just a day looking where you know we're looking for
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.080]   feedback and I got to let you know I mean I tried it
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.440]   um I've had this one for about a month or two
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:40.480]   and you know I actually wanted to buy more but it's not for sale yet
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.160]   um because the thing that was amazing to me about
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.040]   you know Dave I'm sorry I'm not going to call it Dave's lotion
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:54.400]   C60 Labs lotion C60 lotion was you know I I suffer from eczema on my hands
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.440]   and so one of the problems that you know for those of you who have eczema
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.680]   you know how your hands get crusty and if they could literally
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.240]   you know crack and then it's even worse right because at my work
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:12.640]   they have this horrible foamy industrial toxic
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.480]   hand soap in the in the restrooms and you know you have to wash your hands
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.240]   I don't want to carry around a bar so so when I use that stuff my my eczema
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.600]   gets even worse and then you know what's really amazing
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.520]   I was trying the C60 Labs just you know just testing it out
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.640]   and darn I swear it's actually making my eczema
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:37.280]   it just it's reducing my outbreaks it keeps my hands super moist
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.480]   where I don't get crusty and I'm just amazed I told him I couldn't believe it
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.200]   this that you know that that C60 on my hand C60 lotion
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.760]   from C60 Labs was helping my eczema
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.960]   I mean I'm really honestly I was very very surprised
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.040]   and so you know what great product great company
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.280]   you know something to think about and now the next one that I got a free
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:06.320]   sample from was the Leela Labs and they have a brand called the Akasha
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.560]   sacred brand it comes in a body lotion and a face cream
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.360]   now what's real interesting here and and this is the other thing about C60 Labs
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.440]   as well and you'll see this in the other products
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.040]   was when I first started thinking about a C60
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:26.480]   topical product I started with just raw PC60 right pulver IC60
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.920]   and then I decided I'll try mixing the you know pulver IC60 with a penetrator
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.960]   like DMSO and you know and transcoodle and that was my second video you know
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.920]   and I was like it was such a Homer moment I mean I
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.800]   sometimes I refer to myself as you know as a Homer in the nuke plant of life
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.120]   because that's how I feel I am sometimes because it was so stupid
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.640]   that I didn't realize that that was not the the approach to take because when I
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.240]   look at all of these these these these really creative and really great
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.040]   businessmen creating topical products it's like a
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.640]   complete dope moment because it's like oh you know what that was really
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.280]   stupid way I approached it because the way to do it
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.360]   and this is every one of them have done this
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.520]   is they make a C60 oil with an oil or oils
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.800]   and then they mix other ingredients and that's how you're making the product
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.120]   so it's like der you know it's so it's kind of funny so
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.520]   here you go again now this is what and this is a company
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.320]   the owner operator's name is Philip and he was so kind enough to to give me
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.200]   some samples and so basically but they don't look at
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.400]   their ingredients right their ingredients is they use
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.640]   of olive oil plus full rene so they're using a C60
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:46.400]   olive oil as their as their C60 ingredient and then what's really cool
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.760]   is that they then mix it with alloy again you see this alloy coconut milk
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.720]   coconut oil they have some alcohol in there
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:00.800]   calendula flour extract essential oils vegetable vitamin E zanathan gum
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.720]   so you can see there's a lot of cosmetic stuff going on a lot more
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.320]   ingredients than the other one has and then of course there's even more
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.600]   essential oils and I don't really know how to pronounce
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.920]   some of these so I'm not going to try you can read it
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.960]   and then of course what's really great I mean this is cool
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:20.560]   and you know this totally aligns with my lifestyle but it's all certified
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.240]   organic agriculture all GMO free I mean so
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.400]   this is a really you know if you're if you're into that and that's important
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.400]   to you this is this is an amazing you know product
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.440]   and so kind of just give you an idea about what this one looks like
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.880]   now the difference with this one now as the C60
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.640]   labs and by the way the C60 labs one it just smells wonderful
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:49.600]   but this one it smells really I mean the other one smells like
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.360]   really good coconut oil but a cautious sacred it has this
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:58.480]   great herbal like I mean it smells good it's like you walk into a small you
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.480]   know spa you know those fancy hoity toity spas where everybody's
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.560]   like so happy I mean there's the happiest place on earth is not Disney it's
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.160]   going to a spa and and and so everyone's so happy
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.640]   and it just smells like that and it's just smells great
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.400]   and so this is the this right there was the body lotion
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.000]   and they both have I believe the same ingredients and I hope that's correct
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.760]   because that's what I could tell but you know and then it comes again like
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:30.720]   this was the body lotion right it's it's it's very
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.440]   it's a little bit more it's I mean I went a little bit but it's definitely
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.600]   more liquidy I don't know if that's an approved word in the world but
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.240]   liquidy and then there's the face cream and the cream is really rich
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:48.000]   I mean it smells just awesome and it's this really rich texture like
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.760]   like just fine you know just really like it looks expensive
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.200]   and then you know so this is what it looks like it really holds its body
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.720]   and then what I want to demonstrate though you know and by the way I'm just
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.640]   a middle-aged man doing lotion commercial right now basically
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.680]   so it's kind of awkward for me but I want to point out that this one it
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.920]   smells great eh and and it's got all these incredible
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.520]   essential oils but it also too you know like even with the last one
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.960]   it it's not greasy at all I mean these guys have done a really good job so
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.240]   that because you know I've put C60 oil on my skin before
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:27.360]   okay it works great like I just you know the testimony got right
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.280]   but then also at the same time though these these lotions have C60 oil in them
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.080]   but your skin isn't oily and that's a big deal for me because I don't
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.920]   like to feel oily so that's another really big plus and you know being a
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.760]   guy that's about as much as I can think of in terms of saying great stuff
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.880]   about the Kasha I think it's a great product
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.640]   I've been using it for a week now and the one thing that really stands out to
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.720]   me about this product after using it for a week is that
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:58.640]   I've got really dry skin on my legs I guess that's TMI right anyway so I
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:04.160]   I put it on one application one time and I just
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.000]   wanted to see what would happen literally two three days later my skin
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.200]   was still moist I was like wow I mean you know that's
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.600]   wow to me because I've tried other stuff and it doesn't last that long so
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.440]   you know not to imply that I don't take showers regularly but this was an
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:24.080]   this was an experiment hey so so I want to make sure of your nose I do take
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.720]   showers daily but I did an experiment where I waited
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.480]   three days okay TMI again okay but but I just want to say
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.000]   that I thought this was really great it's really great at moisturizing
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   and it smells awesome so this is a Layla Labs C60
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.520]   called the cautious sacred brand and this is all brand new too this is a
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.960]   launch this is made in Germany and this one
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:50.560]   it launched in 2019 okay I believe okay now I did find another one I didn't
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.080]   get a sample of this one in time for the video but this is from a company
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.120]   called Natural Pathic Care and what they've created is a C60
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.800]   hyper moisturizing sensitive cream I just just wanted to point this out as
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.080]   another C60 product and in this one I think it's quite
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.480]   interesting for those of you budding scientists
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.160]   tinkerers out there who want to make your own C60 topical
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.080]   product you know which is awesome go ahead do that I mean the world needs
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.520]   more of this stuff out there right but what these guys did which I think is
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.360]   interesting when you look at the ingredients
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.560]   is that they made an olive oil C60 olive oil
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.520]   they used emo oil and I'll talk about that a little while
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.680]   then they're using yo-yo-ba I guess you pronounce it but here you go
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:37.680]   now they took and they made it a Moroccan argan C60 oil a macadamia C60 oil
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.200]   and a rosehip oil right so they actually have three
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.720]   different C60 oils where they made the oil separately which you
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.720]   don't see 60 and then there's three different C60 oils
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.360]   within more different oils right with the golden yo-yo-ba
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.760]   emu rosehip and then they've got of course some
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.960]   C buckthorn which I have no idea what that is beeswax cocoa butter
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.240]   hyaluronic acid water glycerin and here you go
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.680]   aloha alloy sorry I keep getting that wrong
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.120]   yeah I live in Hawaii I see those first three letters and I think aloha
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.120]   anyway so so you know this is what's really interesting is that these guys
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.280]   are using multiple different kinds of C60 oil
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.440]   and mixing it all together to make their products so I just oh and I want to
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.160]   point this one out I thought it was very different and
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.640]   and a really cool approach instead of just using all of oil as your base or
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.920]   coconut oil as your base they use multiple ones there you go
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:41.440]   so that's another interesting one now the other new topical product out
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.680]   there for C60 topical products now Layla Labs out there on the cutting edge
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.080]   one more time they've actually created a facial oil
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.800]   and it's just an oil okay and so the ingredients here is 100% organic ingredients
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:59.520]   organic farming but it's got 80 milligrams per 100 milliliters
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.160]   of C60 so that's basically the same as buying a C60 oil you're
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.560]   going to ingest but what they've done is they've
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:12.880]   basically made an apricot kernel oil right it's C60 apricot kernel oil
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.760]   that's what it basically is at the end of the day which has
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:19.920]   and and because of the fact that it's an essential oil and their C60
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.640]   merged into an essential oil they come out with this really
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.720]   incredible product that's that's that's really really good for your skin
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:32.880]   now I tried this guy and let me tell you as a C60 oil without anything else in
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.880]   it I had I had a pretty interesting effect
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:41.920]   I put it on one night and then I the next day
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:47.600]   I started to detox right where I had put it on so I started to get some detoxing
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.920]   on my skin so it is definitely a very powerful oil
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.640]   and then the C60 in it obviously just really amps up the effect
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.960]   and so when you look at the website you know what they say about this oil is
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.560]   they carefully selected essential oils highland lavender
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.680]   carter ee incense peta grain biogarade and lemon
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.680]   myrtle sorry about the mispronunciations here
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.440]   and also and they also have an antibacterial anti-inflammatory
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.520]   and regenerating effect and they smell pleasant and soothing the oil
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.160]   also receives and I think this is quite important
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.480]   is that this oil this facial oil also receives a frequency
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:34.000]   increase in its production process induced by a very special process
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.720]   and it's and it's a roll-on like you saw so
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.040]   I you know I got to tell you I mean of all of the ones that I've tried so far
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.320]   this one really kind of caught me off guard in terms of like wow
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.880]   I mean you know I you know it's just like I actually did
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.240]   break out in in little pimples right where it was it was just like it was
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.600]   just detoxing me and I was like wow you know so I
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:59.920]   I would suggest if you you go slow with that one but it definitely works
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:04.000]   it's an amazing C60 product you know I'd actually thought about
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.600]   doing C60 with essential oils and and this is really a really cool start so
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.200]   a great idea you know Layla Labs great product
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.280]   oh and by the way this thing smells awesome it smells very different than
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.880]   the Akasha sacred products and it it smells
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.520]   just wonderful I mean all of these just smell great
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.520]   that's what's really kind of amazing you know all these C60 products
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:32.240]   and they smell good so I just want to point that out so
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.760]   now the last one I wanted to kind of just show you as another product that
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.400]   this product came out in 2019 as well so you know we've got this
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.600]   just this launch here we go at C60 topicals right
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.120]   and they all started the launch in 2019 they're launching or not
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.120]   launching now and this one is a product by Red Lion
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:56.320]   and and it's called the elixir of esclipios I hope I pronounced that one
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.520]   correctly what's really kind of interesting I just want to do a little
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.760]   background on this is that esclepios I have to go look that up because like
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.600]   what does that mean you know and and really is is it is basically
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:14.720]   referring to the rod of esculopius also known as the staff of
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.800]   esculopius okay it's a serpent entwined rod that's
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:23.840]   this guy right here welded by the Greek god esclopius
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.880]   dt associated with healing and medicine the symbol has continued to be used in
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.000]   modern time where it is associated with medicine
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.120]   and health care so you know creative name two points for that right or ten
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:42.160]   points or the great name for healing and and wellness I think that's a
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.600]   it's a very clever name so I you know it's such if anyone wanted to know what
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:50.080]   what that meant it's the elixir of medical you know wellness right
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.240]   and health care so but what this is now and this is very different
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:59.600]   from a C60 essential oil or a C60 topical lotion or cream
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:04.080]   what this is now and and if you had a chance to see the the webinar with Red
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:09.120]   Lion you know they're alchemist and this is an alchemical elixir
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.840]   in the form of carbon 60 and oil and so
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.360]   that's all that there is just or basically it's organic coconut oil
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:22.240]   and a form of carbon 60 that is prepared alchemically
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.840]   that is now is called by Red Lion C60RA
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:30.880]   so what this one looks like when you look at it it just appears to be
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:36.320]   a you know basically if you look at it it just appears to be coconut oil
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.520]   so one of the things that that you know that you should be aware of
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.600]   is that the C60 from Red Lion is transparent
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.040]   and so you're only going to see what the oil you're not going to see like you
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:51.360]   know purple color anything like that it's transparent so that's what their C60
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.520]   in coconut oil looks like but it's very different than their other product
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:59.840]   which is alchemical C60 this one is C60RA so
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:03.840]   it really it stays cold you know under 76 degrees it will harden
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.560]   that's what it looks like there because it's kind of chilly here in Hawaii right
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.240]   now so it's kind of cool so all of my coconut oils have
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.320]   hardened in my house and then basically it's the instructions
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:19.520]   for using this one because it's it's alchemical in nature
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:25.520]   is to use it extremely sparingly and and it has what Martin at Red Lion
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:30.240]   would refer to as a magnetic effect so it's it's a little different than a
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.640]   skin lotion with C60 because at that point you've got those
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.560]   wonderful other substances and the C60 doing things
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.600]   with this one it's just the C60 doing things
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.480]   and it's out in alchemical C60 so it's going to go and do it's C60
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.800]   thing but he calls it magnetic because what it'll do is it'll go to where
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:56.000]   it's needed the most in your body and so if you go on to Red Lion's
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.800]   site and you look at some of the newsletters you'll you'll read these
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.240]   incredible testimonies of people who are using
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:06.800]   this product in terms of it helping with pain and you know your typical
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:11.040]   ish you know your typical responses that people have to see 60
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.000]   is what people are reporting in terms of using
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.320]   this elixir so it is quite amazing and then because it's alchemical
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:23.360]   you know the maker Red Lion does does suggest that there is an emotional
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.720]   component to it as well just like there's a frequency embedded in
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.760]   Layliff frequency well you know some of these folks are
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.600]   tinkerers and they will actually add more properties to
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:38.000]   their products than just your typical you know you know lab would that you
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.880]   know you know substance one two three and then boom you got a product
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.520]   but they actually tinker with it and they add substances to it or they add
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.720]   elements to it I guess would be the best way and attributes to the to the
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.280]   product so there's an emotional attribute to this
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.880]   product and I'm not going to go into too much depth there
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:59.440]   but I will say that for me I've tried this I've had this one for about a month
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:04.080]   and every time I try it what pretty much Martin warns about
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:10.320]   yeah I experience and so it is highly recommended by myself
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.760]   use this one sparingly you know when he says only do a drop
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.280]   yeah only do a drop for starters it does have an effect
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:22.560]   and much more than detox and so forth so amazing product from
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:27.280]   amazing company so that's my product review
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:32.960]   of four different C60 topical products on the market now
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:37.600]   I think it's awesome I think your 2020 is going to be a year of C60 topical
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.960]   and there's all these great wonderful products you can go out and try
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:45.760]   I highly recommend you know try any one of them or just use your C60 oil
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:50.080]   you know like my friend did and you know there are some amazing
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.480]   amazing results that you could get and you know
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.000]   so I wish everyone you know good health and give this a try
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.920]   I have that's all I've been doing the last month
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.760]   preparing for this video now the last one I want to kind of just share
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:05.760]   is part of preparing for this video is I attempted to make my own
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:10.560]   C60 topical oil so that I could talk about it and share it with you
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.320]   but it was a fail and so what I want to share with you
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:18.400]   what happened now first of all I like that one product
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:22.400]   you know the I think the natural pathic one has emo oil in it well
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.080]   you know if you like if you I'll show I'll put the link in the video description
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.600]   but you know if you go and you research
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.080]   the the skin benefits from emo oil and then if you actually look at the science
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:37.440]   studies themselves you go on you know research gate or wherever and you look
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.800]   up the studies about it you know these these bullet points are our
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:45.040]   actual hard hard science and you've got you know it's emo oil which comes from
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.160]   this bird that's sort of in the ostrich family
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.920]   or not sort of it is and you know the oil that you get from this
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:56.480]   critter is moisturizing it prevents skin aging
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:01.120]   it decreases inflammation and improves wound scars and skin damage
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.200]   it reduces nipple sensitivity whatever that means
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.120]   repels bugs and it helps hair and nail growth and these are the key
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:12.000]   bullets so I'm thinking you know when I read this stuff about emo oil I'm
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   like oh cool let me try it so what happened was
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.200]   was first of all this thing is worse than coconut oil
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.560]   when it comes to getting us becoming solid it
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.880]   at cooler temperatures I mean coconut oil turned solid at 76 this stuff was
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.760]   solid it like literally 80 I mean it was like just
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:35.120]   gloopy and thick and so I when I tried to make this
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.560]   you know I I didn't have at the time I didn't have
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.840]   my brand new hot plate stir so if you don't have a
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:46.640]   hot plate stir you're going to be hard-pressed to be able to mix this stuff
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:51.680]   with C60 because it's so thick so the the hottest the warmest I could
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.560]   keep it was in a bathroom where I closed the door
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.760]   and I tried to stir it up and I approached it with the two weeks stir
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.120]   you know two-week rest and then filter right or not even filter but because
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:06.240]   it was going to be topical with pulverized C60 so I used pulverized C60 I
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.800]   tried to make a batch of C60 emo oil first big challenge was it was just
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.640]   so viscous and then I didn't have a way to keep it hot
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.240]   and I would assume that you'd least need to warm it up to like 90 degrees
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:23.760]   to keep it liquidy in order for you to to actually blend the C60 with it so
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.440]   that was a big fail because when I actually pulled it off after two weeks
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:31.520]   even at like I think those I was watching the temperature in that room
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:36.400]   and it never got over 78 or 80 you know and and literally there was like
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.880]   almost no saturation whatsoever the the oil is sort of like a
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:45.360]   beige white and it didn't turn it turned very light gray so there was a very
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.240]   very little C60 when I looked at the very bottom of
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.040]   of the of the flask the majority of the C60
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:54.720]   sunk to the bottom and it did not go into the oil so it was very very
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:59.200]   difficult if not impossible to make C60 emo oil
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.120]   but I did but I did have a little bit of it that was a little gray
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:06.640]   and then my other story was that one of my daughter's friends has acne
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.520]   um and it's not severe but it's pronounced right
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:13.280]   and so I don't know about a year ago or so one day she was over at my house
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.800]   and I was making C60 olive oil and I just finished a batch and I said well you
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:20.400]   know I offered her C60 olive oil I said well you want to try this on your face
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.480]   because you know I do all the research I explained it to her and she said sure
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:29.120]   so she tried my home blend C60 olive oil on her face
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:33.760]   over a year ago and she just was she was a convert immediately it like it
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.240]   improved her her face she called me up like about a
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:41.040]   week later and asked me where they where she could buy some because she
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.000]   wanted to her some of her friends at her work
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.880]   had noticed that her face had really cleared up she explained what she had
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:50.400]   used for that and her friends wanted to buy some so I referred her to some
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.480]   places where she where they could buy C60 olive oil
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.440]   and then she ended up using up her bottle interface was clear and now is
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.000]   the last of it I don't really see her very often my
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.520]   daughter doesn't bring her over she went to college
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:10.320]   so but so about a month or two ago my daughter was home for the holiday
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.680]   um one of them and uh and so they're you know here's your friend her friends
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.120]   comes along and she's again broke out in acne
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:21.200]   so I had I was doing my emo oil thing and I decided oh hey you know you want
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.360]   to try this C60 emo oil I mean it was light gray it had
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:30.400]   some C60 in it most of the C60 fell out so I wasn't sure but I was like
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.360]   you know it's got some in it and you know based on all this research you might
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.640]   want to give it a try so she took a small bottle with her and in the very
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.160]   next like two days later my daughter goes you know dad
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.640]   that was that was really bad I'm like what what do you mean what happened she
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:45.680]   goes yeah she tried that emo oil on her face and she broke out in a really
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.920]   bad rash and you know and and it took a you know a couple days to
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:54.880]   to go away and I felt really bad I'm like
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:58.960]   you know how do you know it's like okay uh yeah apparently she's allergic to
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.160]   emo oil and how the heck would you know that so
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:07.440]   yeah between I couldn't make a decent batch and between this poor girl
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:12.080]   breaking out in a rash you know C60 emo oil for me was a
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.400]   major fail so my idea of making an emo oil
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:22.640]   C60 topical product is is in the in the trash can so I'm not you know so I
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.840]   just wanted to share that story for any one of you that's out there
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.920]   thinking about making C60 emo oil and it could be the reason that that other
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:34.640]   product didn't try that they just added emo oil but yeah so you know
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:39.040]   it's trial and error that was just one of my tinks I tried to give it a try
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.520]   and it it totally didn't work but it is amazing to when you look at the other
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.240]   folks and what they're doing and their ingredients
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:52.240]   and and so forth so there you go so hey again you know what really cool
