[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and this
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.360]   video is a further installment in the video series. Welcome to Layla Q. Otherwise known as Layla
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.040]   Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade. This is a video FAQ series answering questions that frequently pop
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.520]   up in our telegram chat group. So one of the questions I wanted to address, which I actually
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.920]   addressed a couple of years ago, which is, you know, like, how does quantum energy affect plants?
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.480]   Can I use it for my plants? Well, plant plants, plants, plants, right? So I actually did a video
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.760]   about almost two years ago called Quantum Garden. And I want to just basically add that video. So
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.800]   this is a replay, repost, whatever you want to call it, of a video that I did back in March of
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.840]   2023. It's called the Quantum Garden. I'm just going to go ahead and play it right now, because
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.880]   I wanted to add this video as one of the answers to the FAQ series. So if you've already seen the
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.600]   video, you're good to go for anyone who's new to quantum energy and would like to know how quantum
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.000]   energy can be used for agriculture, as well as your plants, your garden, your yard, your field,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.480]   then this is the video for you. So anyway, thanks for watching. And here's the Quantum Garden.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.000]   Aloha, everyone. And welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host, Kay Elmer.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.760]   And in this video, I'd like to share with you the stories, the testimonies, and the results
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.800]   of what people have been experiencing using quantum energy to help their garden thrive,
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.360]   help their plants that they're growing. Now, this video applies to anybody who's interested in
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.680]   growing. If you have a garden, or if you have crops for agriculture, landscapers, and so forth,
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.880]   because this is what people, real life stories, are experiencing when they take these quantum tools,
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.480]   primarily provided by Leila Quantum Tech, these quantum blocks that they sell. And when they use
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.880]   these tools with regards to plants, these are the stories that are coming out from them,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.680]   and they're very, I mean, really quite amazing as to what quantum energy the impact of that has
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.800]   on plant growth and so forth. So these are actually, I grabbed as many pictures as I could from the
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.680]   chat history on Telegram, plus pictures that people have sent me in terms of like what their
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.240]   experiments are, which is great. I love the fact that you guys are out there tinkering. I've been
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.240]   tinkering Philip Tinkers with, you know, just like what else can this do, you know, in terms of like
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.760]   how to basically improve stuff. And one of those things is your garden. So now the first thing I
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.960]   want to kind of leverage is that, you know, it's, you know, it's not magic, right? It's one facet of
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.200]   multitude of things that actually help a plant thrive. So your basic stuff, obviously for plant
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.920]   thriving is it needs sunlight, it needs water, it needs air, you know, especially CO2. And it also
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.880]   needs nutrients in the soil. So that's your basic, you know, stuff that a plant needs to thrive. And
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.520]   that's what I would refer to on the left diagram here is your biochemical stuff, right? It's the
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.120]   biochemical, the bio photons, the water, you know, it's what the plant needs just as a baseline. That's
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.080]   par for the course, right? And then there's another kind of, you know, area of study that also goes
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.840]   into the electromagnetic aspects of plant growth. And that's called electroculture, which actually
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.960]   would be a whole separate video all by itself. And I'll probably end up doing one someday. But what
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.760]   I'd like to talk about is this third, this third little bubble right there. And that's the fact that
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.320]   there's the third component. So not only does a living thing have this whole biochemical thing going
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.400]   on, and also a tremendous amount of electromagnetic stuff going on in terms of its health and wellness
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.280]   and well-being and all that. But there's also this energy component. And you know, that energy
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.240]   in this regards to this video, we're calling quantum. But you know, you can talk to different
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.320]   people. You could other people will call it Ether, Chi, Prana, Mana, or you know, just a bunch of
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.600]   different names for what this energy is. But it's that life that's basically that's that energy
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.120]   that permeates all of our, you know, existence. And it's all around us. And so when these tools
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.760]   interact with that energy and they actually generate that energy, then some pretty amazing
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.320]   things happen. So let's jump right in to some of the results that people have been reporting.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.840]   The very first thing that people have shared is that, and I've done this myself. And so this is,
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.280]   so these are pictures that are coming either through telegram or sent to me or my own pictures.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.120]   But the idea here is this is an example you see where someone had the picture shows or someone
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.560]   had charged the seeds, planted the seeds. The left are just, no, they didn't do anything with
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.400]   the seeds. They just got implanted them. And then the one on the right is they planted,
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.440]   they charge the seeds in a quantum block before they planted them. And you can see what it looks
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.680]   like within a few weeks, the amazing amount of growth and the lusciousness of just the plants
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.200]   that the sprouts that are as they're growing. And now I did my own experiment and I got to
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.360]   apologize. I don't have photos of it. I lost a video in the photos of this experiment I did over
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.000]   a summer, I think in 2019. It's one of those weird things. If you live in Hawaii and you're
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.480]   happy and you have a mouth from the ocean, you deal with a lot of electronic problems because
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.680]   of the salt air. So I had a year where I lost three laptops in one year. So I lost everything
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.800]   that year. So I don't have the photos, but I do have the story. And what I did was I took some
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.600]   heirloom seeds. So I bought heirloom seeds off of Amazon and I broke them into, you know,
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.800]   two parts, right, two halves. One half I charged, one half I did not charge. And I sent them off
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.600]   to three different friends on the mainland and I asked them, hey, plant them, tell me what happens.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.800]   And so what happened was, was they all did it. They all planted the noncharged seeds and they
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.920]   planted the charged seeds. And then what they did was they reported back to me that all of them
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.480]   experienced. First of all, all of them experienced all three of them and myself, we all experienced
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.640]   the exact same results. The plants that had grown from the charged seeds sprouted faster
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.800]   and they produced more and roughly, roughly by a third of the plant's life cycle compared to the
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.560]   control group. In other words, they grew faster, more luscious and produced beans or whatever
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.880]   they're tomatoes, whatever they're producing, they produce them faster than the plants than the
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.840]   seeds that were not charged. And so that was a pretty amazing. So that's four of us doing this
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.720]   in different parts of the country. And we all had the exact same results. So there is something
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.960]   quite interesting about applying quantum energy to seeds. And I, you know, again, this is the
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.920]   tinker channel. So I encourage all of you to go and just tinker with that, you know, it's planting
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.440]   season. So give it a try. Do your own experiments. But the idea here is if you impart quantum energy
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.200]   into those seeds, that plant is going to thrive much more than if it didn't get that quantum energy
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.040]   from the experience that we've done. Now we also back in the day, I mean, I know this was probably
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.480]   years ago, we had an individual who was a micro green farmer. And so they decided to go ahead and
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.120]   charge one set of seeds and one set, you know, not. And so they did the same experiment. And they
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.360]   shared their pictures with me. And so the one on the left is non charged. One of the right is
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.440]   charged seeds. And so basically, when it was time for them to harvest, I guess is that I don't do
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.520]   micro farming, but I guess is that it looks like wheatgrass, you know, they make juice out of it
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.680]   or something. Sorry, that's not my thing. But they basically showed the pictures of what it
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.360]   looked like when they were about to harvest it. So you can just see from the pictures over here
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.520]   on the left, that you know, the ones that were charged, which is way more growth, way more
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.920]   lusciousness, you know, thrive. But then when he what he was interested in was the root map. He
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:36.160]   was like, yeah, the red man look at the root map, the root map. On both of these examples,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.560]   if you take a look at the one on the left right here, this was the non charge. But if you look at
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.640]   the right, he was amazed, because in all the time he'd been micro farming greens that, you know,
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:53.600]   he had never seen such a dense, you know, root map on his, you know, on his produce that he'd ever
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.440]   created. And that apparently in that world is that's a really good side of health and, you know,
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.680]   obviously improve the produce that he's selling as well. So we found, you know, that was a real
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.920]   interesting experiment that happened as well with regards to charging seeds. So that kind of
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.400]   gives you an idea, you know, that, hey, this is really happening and this is pretty cool. And,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.840]   you know, what could you do if you tried it? Now, the next one here is people that actually
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:21.760]   go out and actually charge plants. And mostly, it's people who have plants that are not doing well,
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.280]   and they'll go out and you'll see that, you know, here's someone with an infinity block,
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.720]   they put it on their plant. These are all from our telegram check group, by the way. And here's
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.320]   another plant where someone put a quantum block around the plant. And then here's me right here.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.000]   I just was tinkering around and I got a plant for Easter last year. And I just put it between my
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.720]   infinity block plates. But the whole idea here is the idea of like, okay, just instead of the seeds,
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:48.160]   how about do we just charge the plant? Now, the one funny thing about it is that people do this,
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.280]   but you guys, you always forget to put the after picture. But you, but they do post after that,
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.360]   hey, you know, it got better three days later. It's, it's doing better. The leaves are full now.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.080]   They're not all wilted and blah, blah, blah. But you know, there, but there's not enough after
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:08.320]   pictures. But we do have one example. And this is Philip himself, Philip von Ultzendorf is my friend.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.600]   And he's also the owner operator of Leila Quandatec. But he did one where he had a house plant on the
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.680]   left. And this house plant was not doing well. As you can see, the plant was yellow and the leaves
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.320]   were dying. And so what he did was he charged this plant with one of his blocks. And then a few
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:30.640]   months later, look at this plant, it is just luscious and green and healthy and vibrant, just by,
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.440]   just by charging the whole plant, you know, as a container. So that's, that's another way of doing
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.360]   it. So you can either like, you know, if it's in the ground, you can charge it above ground.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.400]   If it's in a container, obviously you'd want to put the whole container in there.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:48.000]   And then look at what the results are. You infuse that little plant with just this quantum energy
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.720]   and just it boosts its life cycle. And boom, all of a sudden, you know, the problem kind of just
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.240]   alleviates. And so it's pretty cool. What happened here with, with sickly plants and that sort of
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:05.200]   thing. Now the next one here that also has been quite remarkable is the idea of quantum broadcasting.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.760]   Now for those of you who own blocks and you've seen the tutorials that Philip and I have made,
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:16.640]   you know, the quantum block is is a concentrated quantum sun. It's this real concentrated quantum
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.720]   energy that literally has the ability to charge other things, i.e., that's what it's doing,
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:27.040]   right? Charging plants, charging seeds. And then so this block radiates out energy in a field and
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.000]   depending on which block you have, the field is, you know, is a certain size. And then some,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.680]   some of, right now there's the one called the grand block and it covers like two,
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.120]   two kilometers. There's an infinity block, one that's one kilometer in terms of the field,
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:47.040]   the diameter of the energy field. So in this example here, in this garden, someone posted a
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.920]   picture of their infinity block in the middle of their garden, which means that everything around
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   that block with it literally a kilometer. And then most, and then of course it's most more and more
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:03.200]   and more concentrated, the closer you get to the center of the block, right? So even though the
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.760]   field goes out a kilometer, you know, when you're that close to the block, you're getting a lot more
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.360]   concentrated quantum energy closer to the block. So you put it in the middle of this of, of their,
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.240]   of their garden in order to then give the plants all that quantum energy through the field that
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.440]   it's projecting. Okay, so I call that quantum broadcasting and I'll tell you why in a second,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.000]   but the idea here is you can actually then just, you know, give all your plants quantum energy,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.760]   just by plant, you know, by putting your block out there. But here's what's interesting. And here's
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.600]   another example someone posted of using their travel block and they put it out there in their
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.360]   garden with their plants. But here's the thing that's really interesting. And here's a picture of
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:45.280]   Philip at Leila Quantum Tech. And he did that in a greenhouse. And then Philip's story is,
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.960]   you know, he'd had a greenhouse going for quite a while. And then when he finally developed
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.800]   the quantity infinity block, I think about a year and a half ago, he decided to put the infinity
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:58.560]   block in his garden. And for the first time ever, these are the zucchinis that came from
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.840]   that experiment or that tank. And so you could use pretty grinning ear to ear. He grew these.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.760]   This is like, I never had happened before until he actually put the infinity block in his greenhouse.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:16.160]   And then all of a sudden he's got elephant sized zucchinis coming out. There was zoo. And so he
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.240]   shared this picture on Telegram. And it's really quite hilarious. Because these are literally the
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.760]   size of your leg. He's probably bigger than a small kid at that point. He's definitely bigger than his
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.360]   dog. But you could just imagine, I mean, just the amount of that life force energy, that quantum
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:35.280]   energy going into those plants 24 hours a day by simply, you know, putting that infinity block
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:41.040]   in the garden. I had this incredible effect on growth and, you know, and the produce that the
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.000]   plants produce. So there's something pretty wild happening here with regards to quantum
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.880]   gardening, you know, so definitely encourage. So think about that, charging sick plants,
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.280]   seeds and so forth. And here's a couple more examples. Now another way to do it,
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:02.000]   aside from seeds and plants and broadcasting is the water. So quantum charged water,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.600]   we've discovered has a remarkable effect on plants and the very the simplest thing. And
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.960]   everybody who gets a block, you should do this if you have anyone in your family. That's like,
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.400]   you know, skeptical about like, what did what did you buy? And then, oh, you know,
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:21.520]   why did you buy that? Hey, no problem. Simple. Go to the grocery store, get a couple of flowers,
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.360]   you know, the same bunch of flowers, and then take them in two different classes,
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:31.760]   two different vases, charge the water you give one and don't charge the water for the other one.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.960]   And here's an example that's literally this is posted on telegram by one of our members.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.800]   They charge the water and one plant and one flower didn't get, you know, no quantum
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.600]   energy. One plant got the quantum energy water and then look what happened after five days.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.320]   The one that didn't get just regular old water, the same water now is just, you know,
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.360]   one got charged one didn't. So the regular water, it's just, you know, obviously your cut flowers,
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.600]   everybody knows they all start to wilt and die. And within a week, you throw them away.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:08.080]   But try to imagine five days later and the cut flower in the quantum charged water is thriving.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.480]   It's just happy and it looks good as the day it was chopped out, you know. And so anyone can do
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:20.240]   this experiment and the results are 100% the same every time. This is just one picture of many.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.960]   And I've done this and everyone I know that has tinker around with this has tried this and went,
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:30.240]   well, that works, you know, and it's one way to say, hey, you know what quantum energy is real,
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.560]   something's happening. Nobody can really explain exactly the, you know, the, the physics of it or
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:40.000]   the biochemistry of it. But it's happening. Here are the, here's the results. And so the water has
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.360]   this incredible effect when you charge it on plants. And so that is definitely one thing,
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.480]   one other thing you could do for your quantum garden on top of, you know, the other things that
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.280]   I've mentioned is charge the water that you give your plants. And so kind of, and you know, like,
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.520]   and just in a summary here, because this, that's what we're getting. And I wanted to share that
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.800]   with you because it's really exciting. It's spring. Okay, it's spring. Thank God. I'm so happy it's
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.280]   spring. And so I'm, I'm starting my garden. I know you are starting your garden. So now this
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.760]   year, okay, if you've got a block, please use that block and tell us your story. What happened? And
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.640]   what did you do? You know, share, because this is, we all learn from each other. So here's my last
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.800]   parting thoughts on, on, you know, using quantum energy in your garden. So we talked about, you
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.920]   know, charging seeds and sprouts, charging plants. Now, another thing about charging
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.880]   trees now is one time somebody reported that they, they, they took the plates off of their block.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.160]   And they put their blocks on either side of a tree trunk. I mean, you know, like a big tree,
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:43.760]   right? It was a fruit bearing tree. They put their plates on either side of the trunk. I mean,
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.840]   it's a big tree. So but, but just doing that, that's all they did. And they just left it there
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:53.040]   for a few hours, right? And then they took the plates away. Well, what happened was that one tree,
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:58.240]   there were multiple trees that produced the same amount, the same type of fruit. But the one tree
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.320]   that got charged, and they did it early in the year, right before they, you know, the flowers
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.240]   come and then the fruit comes, right? And they did it early in the year. And what happened was the
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:14.240]   one tree that got charged, floured first, produced fruit first, produced more fruit than the other
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:20.640]   trees, and was done like, like way earlier than the other trees were doing. The other trees, you
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.920]   know, were just like way behind, like a month behind this first tree in terms of flowering,
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.080]   fruiting, and producing more. And even when the regular trees actually got to the point where
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.480]   there were fruiting, they only produced their normal amount of fruit that they did every year.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.400]   But the one that was charged produced twice as much fruit. And that was like, wow, that was
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.760]   an amazing story. So you can charge trees, just separate the plates of your block and put it on
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.440]   both sides of the trunk and leave it there for a few hours. Okay, we talked about charging water.
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:54.160]   Now, I want to say that there's been a lot of discussion about how do I charge water for
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.320]   a garden, you know, like how do I get, you know, because here's the thing, guys, and you know,
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:03.520]   from the tutorials that you need to charge, sorry, you need to charge the water for about three
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:09.280]   minutes in an infinity blocking bubble, right? And so, but it so needs to sit there. And so,
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.560]   how do you charge, you know, like, let's say, you know, water out of the hose and so forth. So,
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.720]   it's definitely a challenge. And I know that Philip's going to watch his video. So, Philip,
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.200]   when you when you watch his video, I think that's one of the probably the challenges,
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.680]   the next challenge for Layla is like, how do you develop agriculture or garden products?
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:34.160]   How do we develop something that can charge water in bulk, you know, that you would use?
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.760]   And so we've had some thoughts, you know, there's been, I just want to throw some thoughts out where,
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:44.000]   you know, using, you know, those metal hoses and charging the whole entire hose. And if the water
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.320]   from one end to the other end takes three minutes to get through, then that would be one way that
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:53.600]   the water would be subjected to the energy for at least three minutes. Other ways would be charging
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:59.760]   a rain barrel of water at a time, you know, with a with a block. But yeah, that's probably the one
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.960]   thing for, you know, for in gardens that was probably that is probably the still biggest challenge
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.320]   out there is like, well, you know, how do we do that? And I haven't figured it out either. I was
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:13.280]   thinking you could use metallic tape, like the they make copper tape, they make aluminum tape,
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:19.200]   and then charge the tape and then wrap that around my garden hose, and that sort of thing,
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.440]   because I do container gardening. But if I were to actually have like raised beds and things,
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:29.760]   the challenge with providing charged water again is it needs to be still, it needs to be exposed,
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.960]   right? So you have to basically sit it still for three minutes inside of a block, inside of the
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.440]   field of a block. So that's that's probably the biggest challenge here in terms of charging stuff.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.280]   If it's just container gardening, you know, it's a lot easier, right? You can just put your container
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:47.120]   of water, charge that water, and then feed it to your plants. But if you're using hoses
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.720]   and irrigation, then you know, we haven't solved that challenge yet. But that's, I challenge all
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:57.840]   you tinkers in the world, figure out a way where we can impart quantum energy into moving water,
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.720]   so that it gets that all three minutes before it gets to the plants, and you know, that'll and
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   then share that with the group. So keep thinking guys, keep tinkering, we'll figure that one out.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.120]   Now another story that came out of the telegram chat group is with individuals. Now this has
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:17.040]   happened more than once. I've actually tried this myself is charging rocks and charging crystals,
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:24.000]   and then putting them around the base of trees and plants and so forth. And that has, and then
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.520]   the reports back on those people who tried that is like all positive, like I charged a bunch of
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.200]   rocks, and I put them around my tree, or you know, like I have, I have landscaping rocks,
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.680]   so I put them in the block, and then I put them back, and just the plants around those rocks
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:43.600]   thrive. I mean, they just just go crazy next to the ones that didn't have charged rocks.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.360]   And I've done the same thing with container gardening while I take a selenite. If you know
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:52.080]   selenite, it's long, you know, it grows in really long crystals, and I'll take like a bunch of like
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.280]   selenant, I don't know what they call it, like selenite sticks or something, you know,
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:01.200]   and I charged a bunch of them, and I would just stick one selenite stick, okay, in a container
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.240]   with the plant, and the ones that I did that with the plant just, you know, thrived, and the ones I
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:11.520]   didn't do were just normal. I mean, normal is not bad by the way, right? Obviously normal is normal,
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.600]   but if you, you know, but you can take it past normal, and you can really get this plant to go,
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.760]   whoo, and, and you know, by adding some of these, you know, this corn of energy to it. Now the other
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.560]   one too that I want to talk about is wire mesh, and so one thing that I saw someone doing, and I
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:30.080]   thought that was a great idea, you could buy wire mesh, right, and then you could charge the mesh
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:36.000]   in your block, and then wrap that around, like a, like a, you know, like a, you know, if you did a
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.280]   raised bed, you could wrap that mesh around the bed, right, which is one, or you could wrap that
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:46.720]   around a container, and that way you've got it, if you have a charged item or charged metal,
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:52.480]   in, you know, wrap around a raised bed, and that whole bed is getting quantum energy
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.760]   from that mesh, so that's one way to do it, aside from, you know, like just quantum broadcasting and
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.800]   so forth, so that's something to think about. Now the other thing that I want to mention too,
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:08.320]   that has worked really well, is using frequencies, and so we had an early adopter, and, and I just,
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.720]   you know, and his name was Jack Newell, he's no longer with us, you know, God bless him,
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:17.760]   but when he was tinkering around in the early days, along with myself and a bunch of others,
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:26.000]   he discovered where he took the frequency of plant food, and he basically had a house full of plants,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.120]   and that weren't doing really well, and so what he did was he, you know, he had a block, so he made
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:36.080]   capsules, you know, the little, you know, the little brass capsules with the spheres in him,
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:41.920]   he got the supplies, and he made his own, except what he did was he charged all those capsules with
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:47.600]   plant food frequency in his block, so he just would copy the frequency of plant food onto the capsule,
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.640]   load them up with charged spheres, and then he took one capsule and he put it inside the container
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:57.920]   of all of his house plants, and his report back was, whoa, they turned around, they all went from
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:04.400]   being sickly and not healthy, and weak to strong stems, they were sturdy and luscious and, and
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.640]   vibrant, and he was like, yeah, it worked, you know, and so, so just like my experiment with the
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:15.120]   crystal of the selenite sticks, other people using rocks, you know, his, he was using a frequency,
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.000]   oh, you know, because, and which I tried that, and hey, guess what, it worked, so, you know, think
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.400]   about the idea that you can transfer the frequency of plant food on, you know, to your plant to give
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.960]   it nutrients, or give it the frequency of nutrients, just like the, you know, the heel capsule has
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.920]   the, you know, the neutral biobase, the men's and women's booster have tons of supplements in them,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:41.360]   but you can also use those molecular, you know, flu frequencies of plant food and plant nutrients,
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.320]   and you could broadcast that into the plants themselves, to give them a further boost energy
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.600]   plus frequency, and then you could do it in, in many different ways, but you know, you don't have
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.160]   to do it with the, you don't have to do it with those capsule, by the way, there's another way to
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.640]   do it, you can actually broadcast that frequency, so if you had a block in the middle of your garden,
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.280]   and you wanted to then, okay, I'm gonna, I want to do more than just frequency, or I mean more
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.360]   than just energy, right here's an infinite block, then what I would take is literally just a little
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.120]   cup of plant food, and I put it inside the infinity block, and that frequency of that plant food is
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:20.640]   gonna go throughout your garden, and note that if you live near that, and you live, of course there,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.560]   you know, that plant food's gonna be in the, in the field that you're in as well, but just,
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:29.200]   just remember that the body takes what it needs, and so forth, so it's not detrimental, I think it's
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:34.400]   a very positive thing, and all of your plants would benefit from that, that those nutrients,
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.360]   being, you know, broadcast into the field of the, of the block, now the last thing I want to talk
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.480]   about, and this is the one thing that has not, has not really been tried yet, there's only been
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:50.960]   one report in the telegram chat group of somebody tinkering around with pest control, but it wasn't
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:56.000]   for plants, it was for themselves, and, and basically if you, if you go and look this up in the, in the
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.640]   chat, somebody wanted to see if they could figure out, you know, to create a quantum card that would
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:07.840]   repel mosquitoes, and so they used something, I forgot what they used, and they copied that
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.960]   frequency onto a card, and then they came back and said, Hey, it works, and it worked, and the
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:17.520]   mosquitoes would not go near this lady, when she was wearing this card, that was charged with the
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:23.200]   frequency of some kind of mosquito repellent, so there you go, that's one example of, Hey, guess
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:29.040]   what frequencies and quantum energy work, to do pest control, now as it relates to plants,
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:36.000]   here's an example here, now if you happen to know a guy named Hugh Lovell, and he's the, the father
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.840]   of biodynamic farming, in one of his practices, and he had multiple different aspects to biodynamic
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:47.520]   farming, but one of them is using something he calls, or he created called the quantum field
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:52.640]   broadcaster, and this is what it looks like here, with this guy standing next to it, and so, you know,
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.920]   if anyone's interested in it, I could share the schematics of this thing and how to build it,
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:01.680]   but the idea though is he built a device that ties into the quantum energy by tying earth and sky
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:06.640]   together through this pipe, there's wires inside and crystals inside of it, but he built this thing,
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:12.160]   and it actually captures the quantum energy, and then broadcasts it out, and this nine and a half
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:17.440]   foot broadcaster will cover 2,000 acres, so it's really cool what this thing does, however, what my
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:23.200]   point is, for pest control, this is what he uses for biodynamic pest control, and that little thing
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:28.000]   that that guy's touching, it's like a little shelf, and all you do is you put something in there,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.800]   that's a repellent, and it then will broadcast through that through the quantum field of the
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:38.400]   of the 2,000 acres, and then it'll then permeate that field with that frequency, so not only can
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:44.800]   you send out nutrients, you could send out stuff for pest control, so if anyone's interested, I,
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.040]   you know, and this is another really interesting thing I discovered, which was on YouTube, I want
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.480]   I wanted to go see, I wanted to see testimonies about quantum field broadcasters, people using
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:01.120]   hue levels, you know, device, and only there's only one video on all of YouTube with this old guy,
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:08.000]   and you know, I trust a guy who's, you know, an old guy, oh, crusty, you know, with lots of dirt
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.320]   under his fingernails, I'll trust that guy over anyone in a suit, right, and so here's this guy,
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.720]   he's sitting at a table talking to his friends, and he's just John, and he's talking about his
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:22.080]   field broadcaster, and what he what he experienced with it, and so just as here's the testimony of
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:27.120]   this guy, and you can go look this up, I'll put a link in it, I'll link to his video in the description
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:33.440]   here, but what he did was he had a problem with rabbits, you know, and I'm sure you probably have
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.800]   problems with rabbits, I have problems with birds and bugs, you know, in my garden, but he had a
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:45.680]   problem with rabbits and deer, and so what he did was he took some deer fur with coyote urine on it,
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.160]   and he put it into the broadcaster right here, I'm like, right, this little spot, and then that
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:56.160]   frequency of the coyote urine permeated throughout the field, and guess what he says in his testimony,
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:01.600]   didn't see another rabbit ever, no more rabbits, no more deer, they never came near his field again,
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:08.160]   because why, because they, those animals, you know, they're all, you know, everybody's part,
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:14.560]   everything alive is a part of the quantum field, well guess what, they sense that presence, the
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:19.760]   quantum presence of coyote, and they would not come near his field ever again, and then in that
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:26.000]   same video, he talks about this invasive slug that, you know, that was eating up his garden or his
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.280]   vegetables and his crops, and he also did something, he didn't say like, I could, you can't hear what
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:36.560]   he says in the video, but this, this old guy basically says, yeah, I put that something, you know, in
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:43.440]   the quantum field broadcaster to repel those slugs, but I didn't want to get rid of the natural slugs,
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:49.360]   because the natural local slugs to my area are beneficial to the symbiotic relationship of the,
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.920]   you know, of the nature there, he didn't want to mess with the indigenous slugs, but he needed
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:58.800]   to get rid of this invasive slug, so he found something that would repel those slugs, but not
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:04.480]   the local slugs, and he put that in his quantum field broadcaster, guess what, no more slugs, no
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.400]   more invasive slugs, but the regular old slugs were happiest clams, and we were just, you know,
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:13.280]   crawling around, but the, but the, the invasive ones were gone, they never saw them again, so
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:19.520]   between the lady with the mosquito card and the testimonies of the quantum field broadcaster,
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:24.640]   and by the way, if you do, if you do research on hue level, and biodynamic farming, there's
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:31.200]   many, many, many, many, many testimonies about using quantum as part of biodynamic farming,
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:36.960]   you know, in terms of just getting very positive results as well, with regards to thriving plants
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.360]   and et cetera, so, you know, it's an interesting amount of work, so I definitely would recommend
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:47.360]   anyone interested in gardening and growing, take a look at what that guy has done, but I digress,
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.120]   let me get back to quantum energy in your garden, so that's the other thing that no
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.200]   one's really quite tried yet, so I think that I challenge all of you for this growing season,
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:00.320]   you know, see what you can do for pest control and report back, you know, see what you can do with,
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:06.000]   you know, broadcasting and charging and water, and you know, I just want to hear from all of you,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.480]   because, you know, we're all a community and we all learn from each other, the videos that I do are
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.200]   to share with you what's, you know, what we've experienced, and of course, you know, telegram is
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.360]   not conducive towards, you know, learning what people have said in the past, because, you know,
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.040]   just keep scrolling up and up and up, right, so that's what these videos are for, this is like,
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.240]   hey, this is what a whole bunch of other people have been doing, and this is what they've been
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.680]   posting, because I know you missed it, because you just joined last month or whatever, right,
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:36.400]   but this is it, you know, you can have a quantum garden, and your garden is going to just thrive
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:42.880]   and do so much better, just use quantum energy, and see what happens, and you know what, based on
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.680]   everything that people have been reporting, it's going to be nothing but positive results,
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:52.080]   and that's what's really so cool about quantum energy, it's such a positive thing.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.560]   So lastly, I'm going to wrap this up with something I found in the research for this video
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:05.120]   that I thought was pretty amazing. Now, I don't think that these guys, I'm talking about commercialization,
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.840]   so when it comes down to like, hey, does this work, or does this not work, I'm going to tell you
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   that, yeah, it works, I just showed you all the pictures, it works, there's something really cool
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:20.000]   going on here about using quantum energy with gardening, farming, landscaping, etc. But, you know,
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.680]   hey, is it so cool that you could commercialize it for you tinkerers who are not just tinkerers,
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:31.360]   but you're entrepreneurial tinkerers, you know, for those of you guys out there,
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.600]   guess what, someone's already beat you to the punch, there's a company out there, and what's really
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.880]   cool is the guys, if you're into the 660 world, and that's kind of funny, that's how like Philip
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:48.720]   and I met was in the C60 environment, and so one of the guys in the C60 industry, and the two guys
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:54.240]   in the industry that run live longer labs, they actually created this company, because on the side,
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:59.280]   they're tinkering around with quantum, and which is really kind of serendipitous because it's so
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:03.200]   funny that they're doing that, and you know, we're doing it too, but they did it all off on their
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:08.000]   own, like completely not associated with Layla, and they put together a company a couple of years ago
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.560]   called Weimekla, Ag, Weimekla Agriculture, and if you haven't noticed yet, Weimekla is alchemy
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.640]   spelled backwards, and so these guys have kind of, you know, they're not a little bit of humor there,
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:24.960]   but let me show you their ad on their website, and in terms of what they are doing, and what they're
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:31.520]   selling, I mean, you can commercialize this, they're making money at using quantum energy for farming,
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.600]   and I think that is fascinating, so I just wanted to share with this, you know, share this little
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:40.800]   video with you to kind of show you what the guys that live longer labs are doing now applying quantum
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:53.440]   energy to agriculture. What if all your growing problems could be solved in a better than organic

[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:50.080]   So isn't that cool? I think it's totally cool. They're out there making money with the idea
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:56.000]   of applying quantum to growing. And so can you, if you're entrepreneurial, or if you're not
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.880]   entrepreneurial, bottom line is, hey, I encourage you to have a quantum garden this year. And if that
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:07.920]   video and that company doesn't demonstrate, because everything they were saying is exactly what I
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.960]   just covered in what the members of our telegram chat group, the customers of Leila Quantum Tech,
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:19.200]   are experiencing firsthand. We're experiencing what they described, and so they've just commercialized
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:25.200]   it. And I think that it's just totally cool that the quantum is really starting to at least get into
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:30.560]   the mainstream in terms of just commercialization as well as practical usage. So I encourage all of
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:36.160]   you, go out and grow your quantum garden this year. All right, so thank you very much for watching
