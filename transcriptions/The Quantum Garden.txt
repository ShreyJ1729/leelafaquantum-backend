[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinker's Academy video. I'm your host K Elmer and in this video
[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.760]   I'd like to share with you the stories the testimonies and and the results of what people have been
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.600]   Experiencing using quantum energy to help their garden thrive help their plants that they're growing now
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.860]   This video applies to anybody who's interested in growing if you have a garden or if you know
[00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.860]   You have crops for agriculture
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.280]   Landscapers and so forth because this is what people real-life stories are experiencing
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.860]   When they take these quantum tools primarily provided by Leila quantum tech
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.640]   You know these these quantum blocks that they sell and when they use these tools with regards to plants
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.560]   These are the stories that are coming out from them and they're very I mean really quite amazing as to what quantum energy
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.960]   The impact of that has on plant growth and so forth
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.580]   So these are actually I grabbed as many pictures as I could from the chat history on
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.320]   Telegram plus pictures that people have sent me in terms of like what their experiments are which which is great
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.360]   I love the fact that you guys are out there tinkering. I've been tinkering Philip tinker's with you know
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.360]   Just like what what else can this do?
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.160]   You know in terms of like how to basically improve stuff and one of those things is your garden
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.800]   So now the first thing I want to kind of leverage is that you know, it's you know, it's not magic, right?
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.280]   It's it's one facet of multitude of things that actually help a plant thrive
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.800]   So your basic stuff obviously for plant thriving is it needs sunlight it needs water
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.080]   It needs air it, you know, especially co2 and it also needs nutrients in the soil
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.080]   So that's your basic, you know stuff that a plant needs to thrive and that's what I would refer to on the left diagram
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.520]   Here is your biochemical stuff, right? It's the biochemical the bio photons the water
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.240]   You know, it's what the plant needs just as a baseline. That's par for the course, right?
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.360]   And then there's another kind of, you know, area of study
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.920]   that also goes into the electromagnetic aspects of plant growth and that's called electro culture
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.080]   Which actually would be a whole separate video all by itself and and I'll probably end up doing one someday
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.320]   But what I'd like to talk about is this third this third little bubble right there
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:19.360]   And that's the fact that there's the third component. So not only does a living thing have this whole biochemical thing going on
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.360]   And also a tremendous amount of electromagnetic stuff going on in terms of its health and wellness and well-being and all that
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.080]   But there's also this energy component and you know that energy in this regards to this video or calling quantum
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.640]   But you know, you talked to different people you could other people will call it ether chi prana mana
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.340]   Or you know, just a bunch of different names for what this energy is, but it's that light
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.080]   That's basically that's that energy that permeates all of our you know existence and it's all around us
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.360]   And so when these tools interact with that energy and they actually generate that energy then some pretty amazing things happen
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.200]   So let's jump right in to some of the results that people have been reporting the very first thing
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.640]   That people have shared is that and I've done this myself
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.760]   And so this is so these are pictures that are coming either through telegram or sent to me or my own pictures
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.880]   But the idea here is this is an example you see where
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.320]   Someone had the picture shows or someone had charged the seeds planted the seeds the left are just no
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.840]   They didn't do anything with the seeds
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.240]   They just got implanted them and then the one on the right is they planted
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.480]   They they charged the seeds in a quantum block before they planted them and you could see what it looks like within a few weeks
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.560]   The amazing amount of growth and then the lusciousness of just the plants that the sprouts that are there growing and now
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.920]   I did my own experiment, and I got to apologize. I don't have photos of it
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.320]   I lost a video in the photos of this experiment. I did over a summer. I think in 2019
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.120]   It's one of those weird things
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.560]   You know if you live in Hawaii and you're happy and you have a mouth from the ocean
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.080]   You deal with a lot of electronic problems because of the salt air
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.080]   So I had a year where I lost three laptops in one year, so I lost everything that year
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.040]   So I don't have the photos
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.520]   But I do have the story and what I did was was I took some heirloom seeds
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.560]   So I bought heirloom seeds off of Amazon and I broke them into you know two parts right two halves one half
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.600]   I charged one half
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.480]   I did not charge and I sent them off to three different friends on the mainland
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.440]   And I asked them hey plant them tell me what happens and so what happened was was they all did it they all planted
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.880]   The non-charged seeds and they planted the charged seeds
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:38.160]   And then what they did was they reported back to me that all of them experienced first of all of them experienced all three of them and myself
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:45.560]   We all experienced the exact same results the plants that had grown from the charged seeds sprouted faster
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.920]   And they produced more and roughly and roughly by a third of the plant's lifecycle compared to the control group
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:05:00.000]   In other words, they grew faster more luscious and produced beans or whatever their you know tomatoes whatever they're producing
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   They produce them faster
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.840]   Then then the plants then the seeds that were not charged
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:12.280]   And so that was a pretty amazing so that's four of us doing this in different parts of the country and we all had the exact same results
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.320]   So there is something quite interesting about applying quantum energy
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.520]   To seeds and I you know again. This is the tinker channel
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.000]   So I encourage all of you to go and just tinker with that, you know
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.400]   It's planting season. So give it a try do your own experiments
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.840]   But the idea here is if you impart quantum energy into those seeds that plant is going to thrive much more
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.000]   Than if it didn't get that quantum energy from the experience that we've done now we also back in the day
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.400]   I mean, I know this is probably years ago
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.080]   We had an individual who was a micro green farmer and so they decided to go ahead and charge one set of seeds and one
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.640]   You know not and so they did the same experiment
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.240]   And they then they shared their pictures with me
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.920]   And so the one on the left is noncharged the one on the right is charged seeds
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.480]   And so basically when it was time for them to harvest I guess is that
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.120]   Like I don't do micro farming, but I guess is that like looks like wheat grass, you know
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.040]   They make juice out of it or something. Sorry, that's not my thing
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.160]   But they basically showed the pictures of what it looked like when they were about to harvest it
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.000]   So you can just see from the pictures over here on the left that you know the ones that were charged
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.600]   Which is way more growth way more lusciousness, you know thrive, but then when he what he was interested in was the root map
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.760]   He was like, yeah, the red man. Look at the root map the root map
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.160]   On on both of these examples if you take a look at the one on the left right here
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:35.620]   This was the noncharged, but if you look at the right he was amazed because and all the time he'd been micro farming
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.160]   Greens that you know, he had never seen such a dense
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:46.720]   You know root map on on on his you know on his produce that he'd ever created and that I apparently in that world
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.520]   Is that's a really good side of health and you know, obviously improve the produce that he's selling as well?
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.360]   So we found you know that was a real interesting experiment that happened as well with regards to charging seeds
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.400]   So that kind of gives you an idea, you know that hey
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.480]   This is really happening and this is pretty cool
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.160]   And you know, what could you do if you tried it now?
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.680]   the next one here is people that actually go out and actually charge plants and
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:14.320]   Mostly it's people who have plants that are not doing well, and they'll go out and you'll see that you know
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.800]   Here's someone with an infinity block. They put it on their plant. These are all from our telegram checker by the way
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.240]   Here's another plant where someone put a quantum block around the plant and then here's me right here
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:29.960]   I just was tinkering around and I got a plant for Easter last year and I just put it between my my infinity block plates
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.600]   But the whole idea here is the idea of like, okay, just instead of the seeds
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:39.080]   How about do we just charge the plant now the one funny thing about it is that people do this
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.480]   But you guys you always forget to put the after picture
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:47.360]   But you but they do post after that hey, you know, it got better three days later. It's let's doing better
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.360]   The leaves are full now. They're not all wilted and blah blah blah, but you know, but there's not enough after pictures
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.040]   But we do have one example and this is Phillip himself Phillip on Altsendorf is the my friend
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:04.680]   And he's also the owner operator of Leila quant detect, but he did one where he had a house plant on the left
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.280]   And this house plant was not doing well as you could see the plant was yellow and
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.120]   The leaves were dying and so what he did was he charged his plant with one of his blocks
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.480]   And then a few months later look at this plant
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:23.040]   It is just luscious and green and healthy and vibrant just by just by charging the whole plant
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.480]   You know as a container so that's that's another way of doing it
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.920]   So you can either like, you know, if it's in the ground, you can charge it above ground
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.760]   If it's in a container obviously you'd want to put the whole container in there and then look at what the results are
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:42.160]   You infuse that little plant with just this quantum energy and just it boosts its life cycle and boom all of a sudden
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.400]   You know the problem kind of just alleviates and so it's pretty cool
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:53.160]   What happened here with with sickly plants and that sort of thing now the next one here that also has been quite remarkable
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:59.520]   Is the idea of quantum broadcasting now for those of you who own blocks and you've seen the tutorials that Philip
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:05.320]   And I have made you know the quantum block is is is a concentrated quantum Sun
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.520]   It's this real concentrated quantum energy that literally has the ability to charge other things
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.360]   I.e. That's what it's doing right charging plants to our disease and then so this block
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:22.440]   radiates out energy in a field and depending on which block you have the field is you know is a certain size and then some
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.560]   Of I right now. There's the one called the grand block and it's covered like two
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:34.040]   Two kilometers. There's an infinity block one. That's one kilometer in terms of the field the diameter of the energy field
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:40.480]   So in this example here in this garden someone posted a picture of their infinity block in the middle of their garden
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.160]   Which means that everything around that block with it literally a kilometer
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.560]   And then most and then of course it's most more and more and more concentrated
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.680]   Gloat the closer you get to the center of the block
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.920]   Right so even though the field goes out of kilometer, you know when you're that close to the block
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.600]   You're getting a lot more concentrated quantum energy closer to the block
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.560]   So you put it in the middle of this of is of their of their
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.840]   Garden in order to then give the plants all that quantum energy through the field that it's projecting
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.360]   Okay, so I call that quantum broadcasting and I'll tell you why in a second
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.880]   But the idea here is you can actually then just you know give all your plants quantum energy
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.160]   Just by plant, you know by putting your block out there
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:27.480]   But here's what's interesting and here's another example someone posted of using their travel block and they put it out there in their garden with their plants
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:33.480]   But here's the thing that's really interesting and here's a picture of Philip. I'd lay like quantum tech and he did that in a greenhouse
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.440]   And then Philip's story is you know
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.040]   He'd had a greenhouse going for quite a while and then when he finally developed the quant infinity block
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.880]   I think about a year and a half ago. He decided to put the infinity block in his garden and
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.960]   For the first time ever these are the zucchinis that came from that experiment or that tank
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.680]   And so you could use pretty grinning ear to ear he grew these
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:00.280]   This is like never had happened before until he actually put the infinity block in his greenhouse
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.760]   And then all of a sudden he's got elephant sized zucchinis coming out that was zoo
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.720]   And he and so he shared this picture on telegram and it's really quite hilarious
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.800]   Because these are literally the size of your leg. He's probably bigger than a small kid at that point. He's definitely bigger than his dog
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.640]   But you could just imagine I mean just the amount of that life force energy that quantum energy going into those plants
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.880]   24 hours a day by simply you know putting that infinity block in the garden
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.520]   I had this incredible effect on growth and and and you know and the produce that the plants produce
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.640]   So there's something pretty wild happening here with regards to quantum gardening, you know
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:44.200]   So definitely encourage so think about that charging sick plants seeds and so forth and here's a couple more examples
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.480]   now another way to do it
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.360]   Aside from seeds and plants and broadcasting is the water so quantum charged water
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:59.760]   We've discovered has a remarkable effect on plants and the very the simplest thing and everybody who gets a block
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.600]   You should do this if you have anyone in your family
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.040]   That's like, you know skeptical about like what what did you buy and then oh, you know?
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:11.840]   Why did you buy that hey no problem simple go to the grocery store get a couple of flowers?
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:19.800]   you know the same bunch of flowers and then take them in two different glasses two different vases charge the water you give one and
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:25.120]   Don't charge the water for the other one and here's an example. That's literally this is posted on
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.800]   Telegram by one of our members they charge the water
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.520]   And one plant one flower didn't get you know no quantum
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.400]   What energy one plant got the quantum energy water and then look what happened after five days?
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.520]   The one that didn't get just regular old water the same water now
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.520]   It's just you know one got charged one didn't so the regular water
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:51.480]   It's just you know, obviously your cut flowers everybody knows they all start to wilton die and within a week
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:58.940]   You throw them away, but try to imagine five days later and the cut flower in the quantum charged water is thriving
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.240]   It's just happy and it looks good as the day
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:08.560]   It was chopped out, you know and so anyone can do this experiment and the results are 100% the same every time
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.760]   This is just one picture of many and I've done this and everyone
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:18.840]   I know that has tinker's around with this has tried this and went well that works, you know, and it's one way to so hey, you know what?
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:26.600]   Quantum energy is real something's happening. Nobody can really explain exactly the you know the the physics of it or the biochemistry of it
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.320]   But it's happening here that here's the results
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.480]   And so the water has this incredible effect when you charge it on plants
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:40.720]   And so that is definitely one thing one other thing you could do for your quantum garden on top of you know
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.480]   The other things that I've mentioned is charge the water that you give your plants
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.640]   And so kind of and you know like and just in a summary here
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:53.280]   Because this that's what we're getting and I wanted to share that with you because it's really exciting. It's spring. Okay, it's spring
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.980]   Thank God. I'm so happy it's spring
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.800]   And so I'm starting my garden. I know you are starting your garden. So now this year, okay?
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.560]   If you've got a block, please use that block and tell us your story. What happened?
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.320]   And what did you do? You know share because this is so we all learn from each other
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.440]   So here's my last parting thoughts on you know using quantum energy in your garden
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.440]   So we talked about you know charging seeds and sprouts
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:23.720]   Charging plants. Now another thing about charging trees now is one time somebody reported that they they took the plates off of their block
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.920]   And they put their blocks on either side of a tree trunk
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:34.080]   I mean, you know like a big tree, right? It was a fruit-bearing tree. They put their plates on either side of the trunk
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:39.600]   I mean, it's a big tree. So but but just doing that that's all they did and they just left it there for a few hours
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:46.560]   Right and then they took the plates away. Well, what happened was that one tree there were multiple trees that produced the same amount
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.920]   The same type of fruit
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.720]   But the one tree that got charged and they did it early in the year right before they you know
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.160]   The flowers come and then the fruit comes right and they did it early in the year
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.640]   And what happened was the one tree that got charged
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.880]   floured first
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.520]   produced fruit first produced more fruit than the other trees
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:11.040]   And was done like like way earlier than the other trees were doing the other trees
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.400]   You know, we're just like way behind like a month behind this first tree in terms of flowering
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:21.680]   Fruiting and producing more and even when the regular trees actually got to the point where they were fruiting
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.200]   They only produced their normal amount of fruit that they did every year
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:30.080]   But the one that was charged produced twice as much fruit and that was like wow that was an amazing story
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:36.480]   So you can charge trees just separate the plates of your block and put it on both sides of the trunk and leave it there for a few hours
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.680]   Okay, we talked about charging water now. I want to say
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:46.240]   That there's been a lot of discussion about how do I charge water for a garden?
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.360]   You know, like how do I get you know how because here's the thing guys and you know from
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.720]   The tutorials that you need the church. Sorry. You need to charge the water for about three minutes
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.360]   In infinity to block bubble line, right?
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:03.760]   And so but but it so needs to sit there and so how do you charge, you know, like let's say, you know, water out of the hose
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.560]   Uh, and so forth. So it's definitely a challenge
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.880]   And I know that phillips going to watch this video. So phillip when you when you watch this video
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:18.160]   I think that's one of the probably the challenges the next challenge for Layla is like how do you develop agriculture or garden products
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.840]   How do we develop something that can charge water?
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.800]   In bulk, you know that you would use and so we've had some thoughts, you know, there's been
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.960]   I just want to throw some thoughts out where you know using, uh, you know those metal hoses
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:37.520]   And charging the whole entire hose and if the water from one end to the other end takes three minutes to get through
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.080]   Then that would be one way that the water would be subjected to the energy for at least three minutes
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:48.560]   Um other ways would be charging a rain barrel of water at a time, you know with a with a block
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.560]   But yeah, that's probably the one thing for you know for in gardens
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.040]   That was probably that is probably the still the biggest challenge out there's like, well, you know
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.960]   How do we do that? And I haven't figured it out either. I was thinking you could use metallic tape like the they make copper tape
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.920]   They make aluminum tape and then charge the tape and then wrap that around my garden hose
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.360]   Uh, and that sort of thing because I do container gardening
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.280]   But if I were to actually have like raised beds and things the challenge with
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.880]   Providing charged water again is it needs to be still it needs to be exposed, right?
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:26.480]   So you have to basically sit it still for three minutes inside of a block inside of the field of a block
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.080]   So that's that's probably the biggest challenge here in terms of charging stuff
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.960]   If it's just container gardening, you know, it's a lot easier, right?
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.800]   You can just put your container of water charge that water and then feed it to your plants
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.680]   But if you're using hoses, uh, and irrigation, then you know, we haven't solved that challenge yet
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.800]   But that's I challenge all you tinkers in the world
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.640]   Figure out a way where we can impart quantum energy into moving water
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:54.480]   So that it gets that old three minutes before it gets to the plants and you know that'll and then share that with the group
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.280]   So keep thinking guys to keep tinkering. We'll figure that one out
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.560]   Now another story that came out of the telegram chat group is with
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:05.840]   Individuals now this has happened more than once i've actually tried this myself is charging rocks
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.560]   and charging crystals
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.360]   Um, and then and then putting them around the base of trees and plants and and so forth
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.960]   And that that has and then the reports back on those people who've tried that is like all positive
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.840]   Like I charged a bunch of rocks and I put them around my tree or you know, like I have I have landscaping rocks
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.560]   So I put them in the block and then I put them back and just the plants around those rocks
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:34.160]   Thrive, I mean they just just just go crazy next to the ones that didn't have charged rocks
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.440]   And i've done the same thing with container gardening while I take a selenite
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.360]   If you know selenite it's long right it grows in really long crystals
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.600]   And i'll take like a bunch of like selenite. I don't know what they call it like selenite sticks or something, you know
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.040]   And I charged a bunch of them and I would just stick one selenite
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:55.440]   Stick okay in a container with the plant and the ones that I did that with the plant just
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.240]   You know thrived and the ones I didn't do were just normal
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.480]   I mean normal is not bad by the way, right?
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.320]   Obviously normal is normal
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.160]   But if you you know, but you can take it past normal and you can really get this plant to go
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.000]   Whoo and you know by adding some of these, you know, this corn of energy to it
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.880]   Now the other one too that I want to talk about is wire mesh
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.560]   And so one thing that I saw someone doing and I thought that was a great idea
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.880]   You could buy wire mesh, right?
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.200]   And then you could charge the mesh in your block and then wrap that around
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.360]   like a like a
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:29.920]   You know, like a you know, if you did a raised bed, you could wrap that mesh around the bed
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.120]   Right, which is one or you could wrap that around a container
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.520]   And that way you've got it if you have a charged item or charged metal
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:43.360]   In you know wrapped around a raised bed and that whole bed is getting quantum energy
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.000]   From that mesh. So that's one way to do it
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.400]   Aside from you know, like just quantum broadcasting and so forth. So that's something to think about
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.720]   Now the other thing
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.840]   That I want to mention too that has worked really well is using frequencies
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.880]   And so we had an early adopter and and I just you know, and his name was jack nool
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.520]   He's no longer with us. You know, God bless him
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.320]   But when he was tinkering around in the early days along with myself and a bunch of others
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.960]   He discovered where he took the frequency of plant food
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.480]   Um, and he basically had a house full of plants and that weren't doing really well
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.920]   And so what he did was he you know, he had a block so he made
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.640]   Um capsules, you know, this little, you know, the little brass capsules with the spheres in him
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.360]   He he got the supplies and he made his own
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.880]   Except what he did was he charged all those capsules with plant food frequency in his block
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.080]   So he just would copy the frequency of plant food onto the capsule
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:44.880]   Load them up with charged spheres and then he took one capsule and he put it inside the container of all of his house plants
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.080]   And his report back was whoa, they turned around
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.560]   They all went from being sickly and not healthy and weak to strong stems
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.200]   They were sturdy and luscious and vibrant and he was like, yeah and work, you know
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:01.120]   And so so just like my experiment with the crystal of the selenite sticks
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.760]   Other people using rocks, you know, his uh, he was using a frequency
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.000]   Oh, you know because and which
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.840]   I tried that and hey, guess what it works
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:15.200]   So, you know, think about the idea that you can transfer the frequency of plant food
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.440]   On, you know to your plant to give it nutrients or give it the frequency of nutrients
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.120]   Just like the, you know, the heal capsule has the, you know, the neutral biobase
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.720]   The men's and women's booster have tons of supplements in them
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:32.080]   But you can also use those molecular's, uh, you know, flu frequencies of plant food and plant nutrients
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:38.160]   And you could broadcast that into the plants themselves to give them a further boost energy plus frequency
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:43.120]   And then you could do it in in many different ways, but you know, you don't have to do it with the
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.200]   Uh, you don't have to do it with those capsule. By the way, there's another way to do it
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.440]   You can actually broadcast that frequency. So if you had a block in the middle of your garden
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:56.800]   And you want it to then, okay, I'm gonna, I want to do more than just frequency or I mean more than just energy
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.480]   Right here's an infinity block than what I would take is literally just a little cup
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.560]   Of plant food
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:07.280]   And I put it inside the infinity block and that frequency of that plant food is going to go throughout your garden
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.200]   And note that if you live near that and you live of course there
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.480]   You know that plant food is going to be in the in the field that you're in as well
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.920]   But just just remember that the body takes what it needs and so forth
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.600]   So it's not detrimental
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.880]   I think it's a very positive thing and all of your plants would benefit from that that those nutrients
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.640]   Being you know broadcast into the field of the other block
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:34.720]   Now the last thing I want to talk about and this is the one thing that has not has not really been tried yet
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.480]   There's only been one report in the telegram chat group of somebody
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:47.120]   Tinkering around with pest control, but it wasn't for plants. It was for themselves and and basically if you if you go and look this up in the in the chat
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:54.640]   Somebody wanted to see if they could figure out, you know to create a quantum card that would repel mosquitoes
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.560]   And so they used something
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.560]   I forgot what they used and they copied that frequency onto a card
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:05.520]   And then they came back and said hey it works and it worked and the mosquitoes would not go near this lady
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.400]   When she was wearing this card that was charged with the frequency of some kind of mosquito repellent
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:18.080]   So there you go. That's one example of hey guess what frequencies and quantum energy work to do pest control
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.320]   Now as it relates to plants
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.560]   Uh, here's an example here. Now if you happen to know a guy named Hugh Lovell
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.480]   And he's the the father of biodynamic farming
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:33.280]   In one of his practices he had multiple different aspects to biodynamic farming
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:39.280]   But one of them is using something he calls or he created called the quantum field broadcaster
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.560]   And this is what it looks like here with this guy standing next to it
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.640]   And so, you know if anyone's interested in it, I could share the schematics of this thing and how to build it
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:53.760]   But the idea though is he built a device that ties into the quantum energy by tying earth and sky together through this pipe
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.240]   There's wires inside and crystals inside of it
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:01.440]   But he built this thing and it actually captures the quantum energy and then broadcasts it out
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.440]   And this nine and a half foot broadcaster will cover 2,000 acres
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.080]   So it's really cool what this thing does. However, what my point is for pest control
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:15.040]   This is what he uses for biodynamic pest control and that little thing that that guy's touching
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.320]   It's like a little shelf and all you do is you put something in there
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.480]   That's a repellent
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.880]   And it then will broadcast through that through the quantum field of the of the 2,000 acres
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.240]   And then it'll then permeate that field with that frequency
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.840]   So not only can you send out nutrients, you could send out stuff for pest control
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.160]   So if anyone's interested, you know what and this is another really interesting thing I discovered
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:44.160]   Which was on youtube, I want I wanted to go see and I wanted to see testimonies about quantum field broadcasters
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.040]   People using hue levels, you know device
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:51.600]   And only if there's only one video on all of youtube with this old guy
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.560]   And you know, I I I trust a guy who's you know an old guy all crusty
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.600]   You know, with lots of dirt under his fingernails
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.920]   I'll trust that guy over anyone in a suit, right?
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.200]   And so here's this guy's he's sitting at a table talking to his friends
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.480]   And he's just john
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:10.720]   And he's talking about his field broadcaster and what he what he experienced with it
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.200]   And so just as here's the testimony of this guy and you can go look this up. I'll put a link in it
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.160]   Link to his video in in the description here
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.600]   But what he did was he had a problem with rabbits
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.360]   You know, and and I'm sure you probably have problems with rabbits
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.880]   I have problems with birds and bugs, you know in my garden
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.840]   But he had a problem with rabbits and deer and so what he did was he took some deer fur
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:39.760]   With coyote urine on it and he put it into the broadcaster right here like right this little spot
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.960]   And then that frequency of the coyote urine
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:48.720]   Permated throughout the field and guess what he says in his testimony didn't see another rabbit ever
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.480]   No more rabbits. No more deer. They never came near his field again
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.560]   Because why because they those animals
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:03.920]   You know, they're all you know, everybody's part everything alive is a part of the quantum field. Well, guess what? They sense that
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.960]   Presence the quantum presence of coyote
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:13.360]   And they would not come near his field ever again. And then in that same video he talks about this invasive slug
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:18.400]   Um that you know that was eating up his garden or his vegetables and his crops
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.880]   And he also did something he didn't say like I could you can't hear what he says in the video
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:29.120]   But this this old guy basically says yeah, I put that something, you know in the quantum field broadcaster
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.920]   To repel those slugs, but I didn't want to get rid of the natural slugs
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:41.760]   Because the natural local slugs to my area are beneficial to the symbiotic relationship of the you know of the nature there
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:46.320]   He didn't want to mess with the indigenous slugs, but he needed to get rid of this invasive slug
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:51.040]   So he found something that would repel those slugs, but not the local slugs
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.160]   And he put that in his quantum field broadcaster. Guess what?
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.400]   No more slugs no more invasive slugs, but the regular old slugs were happiest clams
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:04.160]   And we just you know crawling around but the what the the invasive ones were gone. They never saw them again. So
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:10.240]   Between the lady with the mosquito card and the testimonies of the quantum field broadcaster
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.280]   And by the way, if you do if you do a research on hue level
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:19.280]   And biodynamic farming. There's many many many many many testimonies about using quantum
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.080]   As part of biodynamic farming
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.680]   In you know in terms of just getting very positive results as well
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:31.040]   With regards to thriving plants and etc. So, you know, it's an interesting amount of work
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.640]   So I definitely would recommend anyone interested in gardening and growing
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:40.320]   Take a look at what that guy has done, but I digress let me get back to quantum energy in your garden
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.040]   So that's the other thing that no one's really quite tried yet
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.680]   So I think that I challenge all of you for this growing season
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.040]   You know see what you can do for pest control and report back
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.320]   You know see what you can do with you know broadcasting and charging and water
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.400]   And you know, I just want to hear from all of you
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:02.160]   Because you know, we're all a community and we all learn from each other. The videos that I do are to share with you
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:07.040]   What's you know what we've experienced and of course, you know telegram is not conducive towards
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.520]   You know learning what people have said in the past because you know, just keep scrolling up and up and up
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:15.680]   Right. So that's what these videos are for. This is like, hey, this is what a whole bunch of other people have been doing
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.160]   And this is what they've been posting because I know you missed it because you just joined last month or whatever, right?
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.920]   But this is it
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.560]   You know
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:28.320]   You can have a quantum garden and your garden is going to just thrive and do so much better
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:35.360]   Just use quantum energy and and see what happens and you know what based on everything that people have been reporting
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:42.560]   It's going to be nothing but positive results and that's what's really so cool about quantum energy is such a positive thing
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.360]   So lastly, I'm going to wrap this up with something I found in the research for this video
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:53.520]   That I thought was pretty amazing. Now. I don't think that these guys
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:59.200]   I'm talking about commercialization. So when it comes down to like, hey, does this work or does this not work
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.440]   I'm going to tell you that yeah, it works. I just showed you all the pictures it works
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:10.000]   There's something really cool going on here about using quantum energy with gardening farming landscaping, etc
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:18.560]   But you know, hey, is it so cool that you could commercialize it for you tinkers who are not just tinkers, but you're entrepreneurial tinkers
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:24.320]   You know for those of you guys out there guess what someone's already beat you to the punch
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.520]   There's a company out there and what's really cool is the guys
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:34.320]   If you're into the 660 world and that's kind of funny. That's how like philip and i met was in the c60 environment
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.560]   and so
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:42.000]   One of the guys in the c60 industry and the two guys in the industry that run live longer labs
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.880]   They actually created this company because on the side they're tinkering around with quantum
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:52.160]   And which is really kind of serendipitous because it's so funny that they're doing that and you know, we're doing it too
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:58.560]   But they did it all off on their own like completely not associated with lela and they put together a company a couple of years ago
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.720]   Called y mecla
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.320]   Ag y mecla agriculture and if you haven't noticed yet y mecla is alchemy spelled backwards
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.360]   And so these guys have kind of you know, they're not a little bit of humor there
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:14.400]   But let me show you their ad on their website and in terms of what they are doing
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:19.360]   And what they're selling. I mean you can commercialize this they're making money
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.920]   At using quantum energy for farming and I think that is fascinating
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.680]   So I just wanted to share with this
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.200]   You know share this little video with you to kind of show you what the guys that live longer labs
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.440]   Are doing now applying quantum energy to agriculture
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:44.960]   What if all your growing problems could be solved in a better than organic environment
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.360]   Chemical free herbicide free and pesticide free
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:59.280]   After years of research and development with the leading chemical engineers physicists computer scientists and agricultural leaders
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:04.000]   We are proud to introduce why mecla eggs opt quincey

[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:39.440]   So isn't that cool? I think it's totally cool. They're out there making money
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:48.800]   With the idea of applying quantum to growing and so can you if you're entrepreneurial or if you're not entrepreneurial bottom line is
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:52.800]   Hey, I encourage you to have a quantum garden this year
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:59.360]   And if that video and that company doesn't demonstrate because everything they were saying is exactly what I just covered
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:04.720]   And what the members of our telegram chat group the customers of la la quantum tech are experiencing
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:10.240]   First-hand we're experiencing what they describe and so they've just commercialized it
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:14.240]   And I think that it's just totally cool that you know the quantum is really starting to
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:20.000]   You know at least get into the mainstream in terms of just commercialization as well as practical usage
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.880]   So I encourage all of you go out and grow your quantum garden this year
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.880]   All right, so thank you very much for watching this video. I hope this was interesting for you
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:35.520]   Always appreciate your time. I know what you're busy people and you know spending a half an hour with me is is a lot to ask
