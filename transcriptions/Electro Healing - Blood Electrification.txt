[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another video by me K Elmer and in this video
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:12.640]   I'd like to share with you my go-to electrohealing technique that I use whenever I am sick or whenever my daughter is sick
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.040]   And it is called blood electrification and that's exactly what it does. It's literally passing electricity
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.160]   through your bloodstream and the effects of doing that are very remarkable and
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.100]   Let's get into that detail here. First. Obviously, there's some disclaimers. Clearly. This is not medical advice
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.520]   I'm not here to treat or diagnose or anything like that
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.680]   This video is about a technique that literally has been going for decades
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.040]   And this is the history and the background the patents and and and basically how you do it
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.360]   What you where you can get these devices and so forth. It is not medical advice
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.680]   So from that, I'd like to also let you know that I'm gonna do a little bit of a different format of my videos
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.800]   Because there's such a wealth of information already been documented about this topic
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.320]   I thought it'd be kind of like you know a little pointless to kind of reinvent the wheel when there's so much
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.920]   Information already on blood electrification. So I'd rather just walk you through a summary
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.720]   High-level cliff notes not for shit watching one hour video
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.360]   But just kind of say hey, this is what it's all about. How do you do it where to find it?
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.280]   And then you guys can you know, I'll give you all the links and everything in the video description walk you through the various websites
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.480]   Tell you everything I know if I can remember to say it. You know, these are non-scripted in
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.080]   And and just little I just wanted to share and that's what I do
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.920]   I share what I know and I thought you you might find this interesting if you've never heard about about this technique
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.440]   So let's just jump right in to the the the information here
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.840]   Okay, about the story of blood electrification of this
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.800]   Story right here is on a great website called educate yourself org
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.480]   And it is this is a great website to learn about a lot of other things
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.480]   But in the in specific to blood electrification, I mean, it's it's it's like I said earlier. It is absolutely not a new thing
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.920]   The idea of using electricity to try to heal, you know, any type of organisms
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.920]   Up to including humans has been around for over a hundred years
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.000]   You can go back and find all sorts of different
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.720]   Machines and technology that was created at the you know at the end of the 18th century
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.440]   And that people were trying to figure out, you know, how could electricity help people and you know and since then like I said in my last video
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.520]   I mean you go into a hospital today and there's tons of different devices that are electrical devices that are used in the healing arts
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.600]   But to this specific one it was kind of you know, there's lots of older patents all sorts of different types of equipment
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.400]   But it never really popped up onto the scene of oh, let's try this out. Let's really get into this
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.920]   Until a couple of scientists at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.160]   Back in the fall of 1990 and I'm not gonna get into all of this you can read this yourself obviously
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.120]   But when these two guys did a lot of experiments and they came out with a modality
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.040]   They came out with results from their experiments that indicated that when you basically put
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.120]   electricity at 50 to 100 micro amp fears, okay, that's really really really low power and you put that
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.760]   And you run that through that, you know, you're basically blood renal red blood cells
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.360]   And they watched the blood under a microscope as they passed the current
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.280]   And they were able to then find out that it literally would
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.960]   disable any type of living pathogen in the blood
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:44.160]   And it wouldn't hurt the blood cells. So that was a major major discovery because they figured out
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.800]   Exactly what they could do with electricity that would kill the bad bugs and leave you completely unharmed
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.280]   Now, that's pretty amazing
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.380]   And so these guys came out with that in 1990 and a couple of years later
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.840]   They put out a patent and here's the patent right here us 513 9684 a
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:11.740]   Called electric electrically conductive methods and systems for treatment of blood and other fluids and or synthetic fluids with electric
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.960]   Forces, okay, this is right there on Google patents. You can look this up yourself now
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.440]   What's very important about this is is that it is it states right here in their patent?
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.320]   Exactly what the what the effects are and and again, I want to repeat this
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.240]   Because it is really really really what the point is all about blood electrification
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.560]   and then you take that idea and you compare that to
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.120]   Taking antibiotics and all of the problems and risks that go with taking antibiotics and then you go
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.360]   Oh wait a minute. You mean back in 1990 and or especially, you know, I guess this patent
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.600]   What's the date on this puppy? Yeah, 1991 is when they they applied for it 1990 right way back then
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:02.740]   That the scientists at the Albert Einstein Institute New York had discovered a way to basically do what antibiotics do
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.580]   and which is some electricity and a little tiny box and
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.560]   We don't need to take antibiotics, maybe
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.680]   See where I'm going with that. Okay, so here it is right here
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.480]   And this is the abstract a new process and system for treatment of blood and or other body fluids as I said
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.560]   From a donor to recipient or storage rest receptacle now. This is how they did it
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.880]   Okay, this was 1990 and the way they did it is they took the blood out of the of the person's body
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.280]   Then they you know, basically zapped it with electricity and then they put the blood back
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.680]   And then the second way they did it was they figured out
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.280]   Let's put in some electrodes into the bloodstream. We're really tiny it'd be electrodes and then zap it from that way, right?
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.400]   And that was what the patents all about is basically doing it two different ways in inside and outside the body very invasive
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.680]   But this was remember now. This is the first one and that was very specific to blood electrification
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.760]   But what's really important again as I want to say is that they were able to
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:07.360]   apply with field electric field forces of appropriate electrical field strength to provide electric current flow through the blood or
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.440]   other body fluid at a magnitude that is biologically compatible
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:21.320]   But is sufficient to render the bacteria viruses under fungus ineffective to infect normal healthy cells while maintaining
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:30.200]   Biological usefulness of the blood and other body fluids. Okay, that's huge. That's huge. And so that's what these guys came up with
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.200]   That's what the patent
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.480]   reads and it's all there on the internet and you know, this is not pseudoscience. This is science
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.760]   These these guys worked at the Albert Einstein Institute, right?
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.940]   And so so they came out with this patent and about the same time
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.200]   Enter's a guy named Bob Beck. Okay, and his he's a doctor, but he's like an engineer doctor
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:56.640]   And so those guys came up with a patent, but they never developed, you know, like a commercial use type of
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.120]   Activity it never went mainstream medical or anything like that as you know because your doctors never mentioned it to you, right?
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:09.240]   But a guy named Dr. Bob Beck came along about a year later. He read an article in Science Magazine
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.920]   About that patent about those two guys and he decided because he was an electrical engineer
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:21.920]   And he was really, you know, just very adamant about trying to you know, I guess he's just one of those tinkerers
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.520]   I mean, he's one of those tinkerers guys, right?
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:29.480]   He decided hey, you know, I could build a little thing that does that and he started actually he put together an idea
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.440]   where he could build a little box a little little little little type of device that could actually do it
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.800]   But then his tweak was and this is what his tank was was that you could he decided and he figured out
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.800]   That if you just put the probes right above
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.440]   Where that where your blood is closest to the skin that he could actually?
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:55.840]   Pass the electricity through the bloodstream from outside the body. So it was not invasive
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:03.640]   And he could actually do it for, you know, basically like here's here's the actual handouts from his lectures back in 1990s, right?
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:10.080]   He he did several lectures. They are on YouTube. You can watch it, but here's the actual handouts somebody found it years ago
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.880]   And then of course, it's now made its way to the to the internet
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.920]   But basically his lecture was it was he was it was called take back your power
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:26.280]   That's what he would say at the time if you if you recall if you're alive back then in the 90s in early 90s 80s, right?
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.840]   I you know, HIV, right AIDS was the big thing
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:37.280]   It was like it's all I want thought about and what was afraid of and here he came up with a simple electric electronic device
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:43.600]   That could basically help people with AIDS. It would help get rid of it. And he also was able to basically
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:50.360]   Uses he actually did this as a thing. He used his own money to see if it would work. So he developed a device of his own
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.480]   He spent his own money if you listen to his lectures
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.760]   He went out of the country because the FDA and everything wasn't only going to allow him to do that
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.660]   You know and so he went out of the country spent a good deal of money did a massive human trial
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.740]   Using his device and he discovered that it really works
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:12.460]   You can do it outside the body for a really really really really cheap because these little devices didn't cost much to make
[00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:18.760]   And that it would it did what it said it would do just basically wipe out anything that was in your bloodstream
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:25.080]   That's not you and it would and because of that and there's so many diseases and so many ailments and problems and things caused
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.920]   By pathogens in your blood that of course get throughout your body
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.900]   Especially HIV, you know HIV virus right that it was actually
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:40.760]   Kind of helping people and people were getting better from it. And so then once you've got it figured out in his human trials
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.440]   He came back to the country and then he started lecturing about it and this was his lecture handout
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:51.780]   And then it basically his lecture was a tested. I'll read right where what he wrote. This is his document a tested
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.400]   Revolutionary but almost
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:03.100]   Unbelievable medical discovery may enable rapid AIDS SP Epstein bar hepatitis cancer lupus another disease elimination total cost is like a dollar 32
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:08.500]   This is back then per patient per remission of symptoms requires no doctors
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:15.860]   surgery drugs diet medical pills shots herbs are outside in intervention this break to it sounds crazy, right?
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.260]   It sounds like pseudoscience snake oil, but this breakthrough is now yours
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:29.360]   Despite apparent suppression by medical and pharmaceutical cartels. So there's a little bit of tin foil hat here because at in at what does this mean?
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.780]   You know, what does this actually mean? And it means that he kind of came up with a device that
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:39.820]   Basically got people well from all of these things. It was super cheap
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.720]   And he was gay open-sourced it and gave it to the world. He gave the plans away
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.960]   He said go build this yourself for a buck, you know
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.760]   For the cost they used to say like for a cost of a stick a gum or you know or a nine volt battery
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.920]   You can you know have the ultimate tool in your med kit
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.880]   Was one of his devices and in the beginning, you know, he actually had nothing for sale when he would go to a lecture
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.280]   He had nothing to sell he wasn't developing these things he developed it to test it
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:13.760]   And there's that article in science news. He developed to test it, but he gave away the schematic and told people to build them
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.440]   Himself's he did not build units. He just gave away the how to do it
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.060]   You know how to build your own unit unit, which would that's was what this was was a blood electric fire
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.400]   He would give away the schematic. This is all this is all like open source out there in the world
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.080]   How to build it? Here's the parts list to build it
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.640]   This is the schematic if you could understand how to read it and then his his hand out
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.520]   And this is what his lecture would be is he basically pulled a page out of Grey's Anatomy?
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.280]   And he and he would basically tell you hey, you know what you need to put this is where you could put the probes
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:48.280]   You could put the probes on on on either wrist right there where your main artery is you could put it on your leg
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.600]   Where your main arterial whatever art artery on your leg is or you can put it on both sides of the wrist
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.600]   So there's three ways to put it on your leg
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.360]   Both wrists are one wrist right and that's how he has the basic way to do it
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:07.240]   and then of course he got into other areas of the body that you know if you had to let's say if you're really adamant about
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:14.840]   Trying to cure yourself of AIDS or other specific diseases that you had to do more than just blood electrification
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:20.240]   He would also recommend that you do magnetic pulsing which is PE at math, right?
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:27.760]   And and you would use a pulser and that's that we that's getting into the actual blood. I'm sorry Bob Beck protocol
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.640]   Okay, so there's a difference between blood electrification
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.560]   Which is just electrifying your blog and in killing off the bugs that are in your blood
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.160]   And then there's the actual Bob Beck protocol
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.960]   I want to do a video about that separately because there's a lot more about it than just blood electrification
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:49.720]   But that's blood electrification. Okay. It was basically started in the early 90s and thanks to the
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:56.320]   Work and the and the tireless efforts of dr. Bob Beck who ran around the country and lectured on this gave away all this information
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:03.680]   People picked up the baton that he handed out and they ran with it and so from that point, you know
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:11.200]   There's been out he basically passed away in 2002 since that time a lot of different people have been building
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.040]   His devices and using them a lot of positive reports
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.600]   So if you want to go to a youtube page that's dedicated to Bob Beck
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.240]   There's this website actually is called Bob Beck calm and they have this website
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.440]   It's an archive of all of his lectures and you can listen to him and you can hear what he has to say back in the 90s
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:35.600]   And you can also get you can also hear a bunch of testimonials from people that have used his devices his his specifically the
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:42.480]   blood electrifier, okay, and so that's where you can learn a lot more about what he did and about his device and
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.520]   Then in terms of where to get one this guy's name Russ and he was actually one of Bob's
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.760]   Like in in the later 1900s or 1990s. Sorry
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.240]   He's not that old, you know
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:14:01.880]   He basically was one of his partners and he actually then worked with Bob and Bob's later years and he actually developed a commercial product
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:07.920]   So Russ was the first one to actually put out a commercial product and he actually appeared in one of Bob Beck's lectures
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.280]   Before he passed away where when they started building
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:17.200]   Putting together the actual full-on protocol, which are other steps included into blood electrification
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:22.000]   But just as blood electrification alone Russ did take Bob Beck's
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.720]   Schematic and he created this little guy right here, which he which he calls the silver pulser
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.120]   So if you're actually wanted to try this and see which you know see if it works for you
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:38.360]   Then you know by all means this is where you can get from the original design from the original individual that worked with Bob Beck
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.160]   It's Russ and he runs a company called soda up in Canada
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.640]   And that's where you can get one of his devices and then since that time of course
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.760]   There's other tinker's that have been taking the idea and the schematics that Bob put out that you know
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.760]   That meets the criteria of the patent
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.680]   And and actually does what the patent says it does and so the other individuals that are out there where you can buy these
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.440]   Electrifiers, there's one called bioelectric
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.840]   And this and this and these other individuals are located in other different countries
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:12.480]   I think and they he actually makes a and I have this unit myself actually I do I have a I have
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.800]   The soda silver pulser. I also have one of these are called the dragonflies
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:22.960]   And I actually have one of these and this one actually takes into account not just the work of of Beck
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.840]   Which is his his world ran around four Hertz that was what his device did
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.720]   But if you look into the ten Hertz world, that's the world of another lady called Halda Clark
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.400]   And that's a different vendor and this is the other zapper. These are all different
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:41.560]   They call him zappers or pulsers right and then there this company right here is called para zappers
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.600]   And they also make Bob Beck electric electric
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:50.960]   Blood electric fires, okay, so there's you know these are the three different manufacturers and there's a fourth manufacturer
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:56.400]   And this guy actually sells kits and so and he also sells the complete
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:04.800]   completed device and so and this this website is a link below right this one is called electronic kit complete
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.080]   And he started out this guy started out I think his name is Bolazar or Bolzar
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:14.400]   And he's a European European guy and he actually put out he initially started selling kits
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.680]   And then he's now decided and since then he actually creates his own box and these are the so I want to point out that
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:27.560]   The silver pulser from soda the dragonfly electric fire the para zapper or the
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.080]   Bolazar's I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:39.680]   But if you this guy okay, are are probably the top four products out there and beware
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.800]   Because you know as a tinker I I've bought a whole bunch of different ones
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:49.940]   One there was a company for a while there that disappeared called silver smoke research and and I bought a bunch from them
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.280]   And they worked great
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.960]   But he doesn't make him anymore
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:58.320]   Then I actually bought one from some other guy on eBay and I it arrived and it was like the biggest piece of crap
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.720]   You'd ever imagined didn't work at all
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:04.340]   So, you know some people just don't know how to put these together and some people do it for a living this guy
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.580]   Does it for a living these guys do it for a living that guy?
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:11.560]   So these are the four areas if you want to try this out for yourself and see what it can do for you
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:17.520]   There's where you should go and get one okay now how to use a blood electric fire
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.480]   You know obviously if you read it just you know if you just read
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:26.600]   You know Bob's of his basically these are his instructions on how to use it. It's right here
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.240]   You can read all about it. It's all the different placements
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.960]   But there's a couple I'm gonna link to him a couple of really good videos by other tinker's
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:38.960]   That basically like this guy talks about any any demonstrates that to on you know to
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.960]   Perist to probes per wrist technique
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:49.400]   Then there's this guy who created a video and he basically shows how do you do the one one per wrist?
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:54.680]   So you see how that he does these two right he puts one probe on each wrist. I've done it both ways
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.400]   and I
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:02.380]   Think honestly, I'm gonna get into the what my experiences are but from my experience
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:09.700]   I think that the two wrists is what was more effective and and the reason being is when you do the two-on-one wrist
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:14.840]   If you don't feel a pulse then you're you know for whatever reason your body's different
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:20.120]   You got fat wrists or something, but if you can't feel your pulse then then that means there's too much
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:25.380]   There's too much of you between your skin and the and the probe and the blood
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:30.760]   Stream in the globe, right? I mean the probe so it's really critical when you're doing this and I've been doing this like I said
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:38.040]   Well over a decade that the probe has to be like within a millimeter or two of the blood stream the artery or the vein
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:43.640]   It has to be there and if you don't feel a pulse then you're not gonna get what I would consider
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:50.840]   You know good good contact and so I've done it both where I've had two on one wrist and then one on each one
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   And I find that I can feel the pulse I can feel exactly where I should put it
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:01.180]   On two wrists as opposed to one wrist where I just I can never find the second pulse point on one wrist
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.180]   But either way it works
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.180]   And when I say it works
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:10.280]   What I'd like to just say is you know, I'm just gonna give you a couple of stories about
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:16.400]   About it working. Here's that. Oh, here's that website Bob Beck calm great info
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.280]   If you want to learn more this is the website to go to and then there's another website here
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:28.880]   Which is the altered states and they got a really great article about Bob Beck about what he did and how it works and so forth
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.200]   Of course, these guys sell product and they're just you know
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.720]   They're selling stuff and then these guys is just a nonprofit to get Bob's
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.960]   Dr. Bob Beck's work out there. So let me just talk to you real quick
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:49.080]   I'm trying to not make these videos too long about my experiences using the Bob Beck electric fire because there's two things
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.480]   I want to point out there's the Bob Beck
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.960]   Electrifier, right?
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.760]   Which is the schematic and the device that he created and that he figured out how to use it outside of the body with so
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:04.000]   It's not invasive and then there's the Bob Beck protocol. So over time between
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.160]   1990 early 1990s 1990s 1990s, sorry, and then forward about 10 years or so
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:19.040]   Over time dr. Beck had discovered through his testing and and continually use and refining of the schematic for the device
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.320]   He'd basically figured out that
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:27.020]   Initially if he just do the blood electrification it get rid of pathogens and then he discovered that oh
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:35.440]   Some pathogens hide out in the very end of your nerve cells and they hide in very very very tight places that the blood can't get to
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:40.600]   I mean not get too easily and that's how he ended up with this diagram here where he started doing magnetic pulsing
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.480]   so he started with just blood electrification and
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:50.120]   Then he added on PEMF to get the rest of the areas that the blood couldn't get to that
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:56.400]   He had pulsed the blood but the viruses would hide viruses will hide that's why for those of you ever had shingles or no
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.160]   Someone who has shingles that's essentially the chicken pox virus, but it hides in your body
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:06.560]   We don't if you ever get chicken pox you never get rid of the virus the virus is always going to stay in you
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:12.360]   And it goes dormant in your nerve endings along the trunk along the trunk of your body on the sides
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.560]   Right, and that's why when you have a breakout of shingles you're basically having a chicken pox
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:24.240]   Outbreak on the sides of your body, and that's where the virus lives right and so in in this world for blood electrification
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:30.120]   Well the same problem is is that you could blood you could electrify your blood and bang out anything that's in you
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.120]   Like a flu virus or whatever virus
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:37.040]   Or you know molds fungus is anything that's in there bacteria. It'll just kill it all off
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.360]   but the problem is is that
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.880]   If it's like a chicken pox virus you have to then pulse
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.440]   Where you know these things hide sometimes they hide in the thyroid
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:53.600]   Sometimes they hide all sorts of different areas of the body that basically you know his his handout will go over and
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:59.440]   Show you you know, where else should you you know basically treat so that you have blood electrification plus
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:05.120]   PMF and that was the beginning of the Bob Beck protocol, okay, and then that's what he discovered
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:10.880]   But as time grew on this is like, you know, there's 30 years ago, then as time went on he discovered
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.560]   Oh, okay because of the effect of blood
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.240]   Electroporation which I talked about in my last video
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.260]   But because of the effect of blood electroporation
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.040]   Not blood electrification, but just electroporation
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:29.020]   When you pass any type of current through any type of living tissue the cells will electropyrate
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:33.080]   It'll puff up and and they'll be able to increase their ability to absorb
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:38.200]   Then he figured out that step three was hey, let's put some little silver into the system
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:46.440]   Then the silver then can then eat more easily the silver ions can more easily penetrate cells and then kill any viruses or
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.940]   Bacteriums that got inside the cell inside the cell wall and so the membrane. I'm sorry
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:57.060]   And so because of that he added a step three total silver and then eventually step four
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:03.020]   He added up he added ozone ozone water so that when you drink ozone water
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:10.940]   then it releases oxygen into your body and then because you've done some electrification and you've got ozone water in your body and
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.580]   It releases an oxygen molecule, you know, an O1 actually
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:22.140]   And you know through electroporation oxygen gets into your cell and also kills anything inside the cell membrane
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.200]   So that's the Bob Beck protocol
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.080]   I guess I was gonna talk about it
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.400]   Sorry, hey, you know, I don't know if anybody realizes, but I do all these in one take
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.640]   So that's why I mumble a lot, but I just want to save time
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.240]   my time and yours, so
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:44.080]   Bob Beck blood electrification, okay, it is an amazing thing for me. I'm gonna give you a couple of stories
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.480]   one time
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:51.400]   I was at a horse show my daughter's in a question and they forgot the water the arena
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.200]   And all the parents got a four-hour blast of fine-silt sand
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.240]   Into our faces during the horse show and I ended up breathing in a lot of that sand
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:07.040]   And you know what sand is it's silica and so it basically I ended up with really bad bronchitis
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.960]   I was because all that silica was in my lungs. I was just it was cutting me up on the inside
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:18.780]   micro lesions I was coughing blood and I was on my road to pneumonia and so I did I
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.160]   Used the Bob Beck protocol
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:26.560]   I you know sometimes by the way, sometimes I just will do blood electrification and not do the rest of the stuff
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.720]   You know if it's not severe if I just feel you know
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:33.840]   I feel something coming on I just put on the zapper and for now a few hours and that usually knocks it out
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.800]   But if I if I get really bad like that where I literally am like coughing blood
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:44.240]   You know bronchitis kind of level. I'll do the Bob Beck protocol. I did it for like three days and literally within a week
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:49.240]   Actually, I did the whole week, but you know within a week. I was just way better
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.640]   And I didn't you know, I actually don't go to doctors. I just treat myself
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:59.060]   So that's one incredible, you know story. That's a true story more most recently
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.040]   Accidentally cut the tip of my finger off
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:10.000]   Just like if you look at your finger your ring finger and gonna go back in about four milliliters four millimeters
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.420]   And then just slice that pump that tip off. I did that but and I was just cooking right I was slicing up a steak or something
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:20.620]   So, you know most people would go to ER
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   Like I said, I really don't like doctors
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.180]   so I just put the tip back on clean everything up put the tip back on and then I just
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:34.880]   treated it with blood electrification and I did the Bob Beck because I was really afraid of the
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:40.000]   infections I would get which is the number one cause of you know these kinds of problems, but basically I
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.460]   Fixed myself and I just was electrifying every single day for like two weeks
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.800]   And I made sure I did get a little bit of an infection, but I killed it right away
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.260]   It never got bad and it it allowed my finger to
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:59.480]   Reattach to my tip and I fixed my finger. That's another you know and I did that and I never went to a doctor
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.120]   I never took antibiotics and you know these are the things you you go to the doctor
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:08.440]   With a severed finger, you know, whatever the tip of its cut off or you go to the doctor your coffee blood
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.560]   they're gonna pump you so full of antibiotics and
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:18.240]   And that's not what I ever ever want to do for me personally. It's not medical advice, but personally
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:23.120]   Okay, I have done enough study of the gut microbiome and that they're the
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:29.720]   critical importance of keeping your gut microbiome healthy that I will not take antibiotics
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:36.200]   I will I will find any other way not to and this is what I found to not to take antibiotics
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:41.040]   But those that's just a couple of my personal testimonials about how blood electrification has helped me
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.960]   so like I said you can either just do it as
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.960]   Just using the device and not doing the other three steps or you could do the whole thing
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.680]   You know and so that's really it and it's an amazing thing
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.880]   So for those of you who are prone to infections and things like that, you know, or just you know
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.600]   Just just want to try something. That's not you know a bunch of pills
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:06.440]   You know, I I just I don't recommend it because it's not medical advice
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:11.160]   But this is what it would be if you decided to try it and and it's all about you know
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.360]   And this is how Bob Beck put it take back your power
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.860]   So there you go. This is the story of blood electrification. Here's the actual patent
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.640]   This is Bob Beck's book that he put together
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.120]   It's 42 pages of handouts that he would hand out at all of his lectures that he did
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.640]   And then you know, basically you learn a lot more here on this site
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:36.800]   This is where you would go and and if you wanted to buy one if you wanted to make your own if you're that adventurous
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.520]   You can actually buy a kit from this guy, okay
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:46.200]   Little electronic kit and solder yourself. If not, then these guys this is they're you know now now, okay?
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:51.520]   It's like, you know, 30 years later. So these guys, they're not that cheap. This is probably the best bargain for your dollar
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:57.200]   It's $199 or something like that, right? And it actually does I'll get into a hold of Clark at another date
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.200]   But it does the Clark frequencies
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.400]   The Beck frequencies and then some other frequencies
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.840]   And it's it's got you can do a lot more it's got a lot more features to it and it's about 200 bucks
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.900]   if I think the current price on a silver
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.840]   Pulsor at soda is
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:18.960]   Under 300 or something like that. Okay, so it's a little pricier than this one. These guys are
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:23.640]   They're 400 or more. So they're they're the most priciest and then this one
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:28.440]   Wow, I don't even know what this one costs. Sorry. I didn't look that up before I started this video
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:34.160]   I don't want to hunt around while you're while you're waiting on me, but I know that the kit when I bought it was like 35 bucks
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.160]   So, you know, so the kit's not that expensive. So anyway, that's where you get it
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.440]   You want to learn how to use it?
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.680]   There's some great videos on on how to do placements and the other thing if you want to learn more
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:51.800]   This is Bob Beck calm or altered states. They've got some great detail on it. The last thing I do really really really really want to emphasize
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:58.200]   Is what I mentioned earlier in my other video about the Herxheimer's effect, okay?
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.660]   And so this is what happens if you use a blood electric fire on yourself
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.100]   Or you have a giant rat in your house that you test on
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.640]   then
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.860]   You are going to like the patent says it's proven that these guys proved it
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:21.440]   and it will kill off viruses pathogens and fungus whatever it's in your blood if you ever had ever looked at blood
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.920]   You know, there's a lot of other things swimming around they're supposed to be
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:30.040]   Round things which are your red blood cells and big blobby things that are your white blood cells and then that's it
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.240]   But there's all this other stuff swimming around. Well, that's not supposed to be either
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:38.280]   That's not you those are pathogens the more you have a higher pathogen load probably the sicker you are
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:43.120]   You know, and so if you want to clean up your blood, then this is the way to do it
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.360]   Hypothetically for research purposes only
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:52.660]   Okay, that's the way to do it, but but but but but okay, keep in mind that where's all that gonna go if you
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:57.400]   Disable you neutralize like your Star Trek phaser on stuns app these things
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.120]   Your body has to flush them out and if you do too much too soon
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:08.600]   You will overload your ability your body's ability to detox all that stuff out naturally and it'll back you up
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.280]   And you're gonna get sick and you're gonna be sick from detoxing
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:18.720]   So don't do that to yourself and it's highly recommended that when you do this kind of thing you do it very slow
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.400]   Like try 15 minutes. See what happens to you
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:29.400]   Then go to 30 minutes and so forth. I mean I've actually done it where I got myself up to a point where I did it for three
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.400]   Months straight for like three four hours day
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:37.680]   After work every night, and it just because I just had this I went through this phase where I wanted to purify my blood
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:42.600]   And I will tell you this though after doing that and I did that several years ago
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.940]   I went from having like I don't know maybe seven to nine sick days a year
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:54.320]   Literally sick not injured, but sick - I haven't had any I had maybe like one or two in the last few years
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:00.920]   I really don't get sick and I and I really attribute that to the fact that I don't have I have a very very low
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:07.920]   Pathogen load in my blood and that's my personal testimony not to be taken as medical advice boy. I can't say that enough can I?
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.120]   So there you go
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:17.120]   There's what I know a high-level overview of blood electrification and dr. Bob Beck all the links are going to be in the video
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.480]   description, I hope you learned something. I hope this was helpful for you
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.800]   Thank you very much for your time
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.960]   Because you know you there's so much out there on the web
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:33.240]   But I'm just throwing this out there to help people and if I can help you that makes me happy and that's good karma point
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.560]   So thank you for giving me karma points
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.720]   But thank you so much for watching and listening to me ramble
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.760]   And remember I do these in one to one take
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:49.160]   So be gentle, but thanks a lot guys and and I really hope that this was
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:55.160]   Educational and that you learned something and maybe you'll give it a try and see what happens. All right. Aloha. Have a good day
