[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me, Kilmer, and in this video,
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.800]   let's talk about raw C60 sold out, can't get it.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.280]   Quick disclaimers, this is not a product endorsement, I do not get paid in anyway for making videos.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.620]   So let's talk about this, now I just want to make a real quick video, this is a hot topic
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.580]   going on right now, and as you know, if you're trying to make your own C60 everywhere you
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.240]   go, it's sold out.
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.960]   So if you take a look at my pricing guide that I made in July at the very bottom, there's
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.360]   a section 4, buying raw C60 and guess what, it's not for sale.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.800]   And so of the six companies that I listed, you know, the good news is that there's at
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.520]   least four still taking orders, putting you on a waiting list, and you're going to have
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.520]   to wait.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.480]   Two companies are just not taking any orders at all.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.480]   So for the companies that are taking orders, you know, here's one of your options if you're
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.160]   trying to buy C60, just get on the list and place an order, I've actually done that with
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.400]   a couple of these guys as a just in case you see which one comes in first.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.700]   But the whole idea though is, you know, you have to get on a list and they are taking
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.280]   a back order and it could take anywhere.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.640]   I mean, the only one that's even quoting a timeframe is red line and they're just saying,
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.360]   hey, it's 15 days plus our normal processing time, which they don't tell you what it is.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.920]   So, you know, who knows how long it's going to be.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.880]   I know that MTR is a very small company and they're not able to even keep up with emails
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120]   from everybody I'm talking to.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.440]   And so, you know, it's definitely a challenge.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.440]   Everybody is pressed.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.920]   Please give these guys a lot of slack.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.480]   I mean, they're overwhelmed.
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.320]   And you know, let's talk about real quick, just why is this happening?
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.640]   And just as a casual observer of the industry, I got to tell you that it's really quite simple
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.640]   to me.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.800]   It's just demand far outstripping supply.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.520]   So back last fall, one year ago, there was a character that went on a YouTube video interview
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.960]   and basically started talking about C60 to a wider audience that had never heard about
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   it before.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.240]   So it broke out from the biohackers and the anti-aging community guys.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.080]   And it went into the kind of like the alt stream, not the main, but the alt stream of people
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.240]   who are interested in what, you know, it could do for them.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.320]   And so it kind of broke out.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.400]   It didn't break out huge, but a very small population, but it was a small enough population
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.280]   to overwhelm the existing industry at that time.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.720]   Back then, I did my first pricing guide around November.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.840]   And I only had, I think maybe nine companies that were well established.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.880]   I mean, you've got one that actually goes all the way back to, you know, like the year
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.640]   of 2012, when the rat study came out and they started making it then.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.960]   They were the first, that's Tom Martin and his company, and then Walter Wellness started
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.960]   making theirs.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.640]   And then you have, you know, Gresca C60 started making his and then live longer labs
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.640]   in Purple Park.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.520]   And all of those original guys, those nine original guys, they were only one selling
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.680]   it last year.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.640]   That's only one year ago.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.800]   And just on one interview on a YouTube video, those guys, everybody sold out except for
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.120]   Gresca as I recall.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.480]   And so that at that time, everybody has, you know, those guys have been ramping up production
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.200]   to keep up with demand as more and more people hear about it, word of mouth, you know, it's
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.800]   going, it's, it's just spreading out.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.600]   And now, you know, there's this whole new wave of folks who are selling C60, you know, on
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.480]   top of the original guys that were selling it before last year.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.520]   And now you can imagine that not only do you have this huge demand of consumers wanting
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.080]   the product, but you have this huge group of, well, I don't know, huge, but a group of
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.000]   entrepreneurs and you know who you are, who are now like putting in orders for like, you
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.240]   know, Hey, you know, 100, you know, 100 grams at a time or more.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.360]   And you know, they're there because they want to sell their C60 oil.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.280]   And so it is definitely this big demand wave that first originally overtook the folks selling
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.280]   oil.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.320]   And then a year later, it overtook the folks that are actually selling the raw 60 to make
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.320]   the oil.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.320]   And that's just where we're at.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.800]   I mean, you know, this is early in the industry, it's early in the, the product cycle for anything.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.400]   And so yeah, we're going to see issues like this.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   And here you go.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.600]   This is what's happening.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.360]   So if you want to buy raw 60, you want to make it at home, then you know, this is, this
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.360]   is it right now.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.040]   This is the list right here for the US and Canada suppliers.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.000]   Now, so with that said, of course, everyone scrambling, trying to figure out, okay, what
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.800]   else could I, could they do?
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.680]   And so I did find out that there are two other folks in the subs in the chat rooms that actually
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.200]   have stated, Hey, you know, they bought from China.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.360]   And that's really interesting because that's not something where I personally would have
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.600]   went, but you know, they decided they wanted to give it a try.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.000]   So, you know, kudos.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.640]   So there's two companies that I know of, and I'm just sharing what I know.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.880]   I know that if you go to Alibaba, you will find hundreds of folks.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.840]   I mean, it's not, I'm not folks, but companies in China that are selling C 60 in different
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.840]   fullerenes.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.840]   Okay.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.280]   So there are many, many, many companies in China that actually synthesize fullerenes and
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.160]   sell it, but these are the two companies that I'm aware of that somebody actually placed
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.640]   an order and the order was received in with, with Zion, LIFAR, an individual just placed
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.000]   their order and they're waiting to get it.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.480]   And then with the Shanghai Yao co herbal biology guys, I know of an individual and in fact,
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.360]   I found out about this person because he made a YouTube video about making C 60 oil.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.040]   And he had, of course, where he got it from.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.760]   So I got in touch with him and he and we've been chatting.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:43.600]   So this individual bought from this company, of course, all on Alibaba and they actually
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.720]   received the C 60 and they actually made a batch of oil.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.000]   So, you know, so, you know, you've got all sorts of different, you know, time frames
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.400]   in here, but the whole overall experience though is it's going to take three weeks plus
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.800]   it's going to have to get through us customs.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.320]   And that's the overall experience.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.280]   So I do want to let you know though, there are some cautions here because these guys
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.640]   right here, that's Canada and US and you know that, you know, we're pretty anal, we're
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.760]   tentative when it comes to government and making sure that everything's all kosher.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.720]   And so, you know, none of these guys are going to actually red lines also Ireland, you know,
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.760]   but Ireland is, you know, Europe.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.720]   And so you've got companies that fall under a very stringent set of regulations and of
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.600]   course there's a level of confidence that you can have that I think when you're purchasing
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.480]   from Western European countries.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.720]   And then of course, you know, there's this reputation and it's either good or bad, right?
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.480]   That's just, it is.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.720]   But you know, there seems to be a reputation that Chinese are questionable.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.640]   So I do want to put out a caution though that the individuals that bought from these two
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.000]   companies here, they did get their certifications of analysis.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.600]   They did get their HPLC analysis and indicated, you know, what the molecular weight of the
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.560]   C-60 samples that they got.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.080]   And I just want to point out that they are from difference or like it appears to be from
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.480]   third party A-sayers, A-sayers, whoops.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.240]   And so, you know, and that they're getting their certificates from third parties.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.000]   And so that's, it's all good.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.440]   I mean, you know, if you go on Alibaba and you check out these two sites, of course
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.920]   everything I'm talking about links in the video description.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.920]   Okay.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.280]   So if you go to these two companies and you'll see that, man, you know, there's like, they
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.520]   got really good reviews on Alibaba, which is a big deal by the way, if you're not familiar
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.920]   with Alibaba, they're really a big deal.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.160]   So they've got really good reviews.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.120]   They got certificates up the Wazoo.
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.600]   They've got third party, you know, analysis.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.600]   And so they seem extremely legit.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.680]   And so that's why, you know, obviously the two individuals that bought from these two
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.360]   different companies bought from them because they do look very legit.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.040]   These are the certificates that they were issued.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.720]   So, again, though, you know, it's a caution because, you know, what are you buying and
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.760]   is it really what it is?
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.200]   Because, you know, and the point that I'm making, okay, here's the point.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:12.560]   You're not going to know for sure because I talked to a couple of established C60 oil
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.800]   producers and they are sourcing, some of them are sourcing from China.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   And you know what?
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.760]   But they've got all the equipment and they're telling me that, yeah, they get it.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.760]   They test it.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.840]   It's real.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.040]   And then they also, you know, as a precaution, they throw it back into the oven, you know,
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.840]   the vacuum oven and they, you know, they run it through their own thing.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.760]   So they make sure it's real.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.160]   And so all of us at home, you know, we're going to buy this stuff.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.920]   How in the heck are we going to do that?
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.920]   And we're not.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.560]   So I'm asking those guys, hey, could you share the names and everyone's kind of reluctant
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.320]   to share names right now?
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:49.060]   So I don't have any recommends from the producers to share with you guys.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.880]   And I really wanted that and I'm trying to get that.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.720]   Hopefully I'll be able to share that in the future.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.560]   But I don't have any names yet of who the producers have received from China, tested
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.680]   it and know for sure that it is what it is.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.680]   Okay.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.320]   So we don't have that right now.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:10.240]   All we have are a couple of folks taking a chance, believing what they're seeing and
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.240]   buying it.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.720]   So that's where we're at.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:18.040]   And I think that's a caution given, you know, the Chinese reputation for stuff that, you
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.840]   know, you know, anyway, so now, and then this is even worse.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   Okay.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:30.040]   This is a caution about an Indian company that a person on the chat group purchased C60 from
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:36.080]   the company issued their own certificate of analysis on their own damn letterhead, right?
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:44.880]   This individual used the C60, stirred two weeks, filtered through a .22 micron filter.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.000]   And the coconut oil came straight out.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.680]   Nothing, no color, pure coconut oil, everything that was, was in the powder, it got stuck
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.720]   in the, in the filter and the oil is clear.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.840]   So what does that tell you?
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.800]   So I'm not going to say anything more.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.600]   But this is a situation where, you know, that's why there's a caution slide.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   So please be aware.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:17.040]   Now, I do want to say that this one right here, this guy, the Shanghai, whatever, herbal,
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.840]   biological company, the person who bought from that actually made it, you know, check out
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:26.760]   his, his video, his name is Luke Williams, he made a little video about his, his experience.
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.000]   And then he just sent me a couple of pictures of his end product.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.160]   So when he bought from these guys, he bought the powder, full on certificates, let you
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.360]   up the wazoo, boom, made the powder and it looks good, it looks really nice in fact.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:43.320]   So I, you know, first of all, he did a great job on his first batch.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.800]   And secondly, it actually kind of looks what it's supposed to look like.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.480]   Is it actually what it, you know, we don't know.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.480]   That's the thing.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.520]   So, so hopefully in the future, we'll be able to get some people that we really trust
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:03.600]   in the U.S., buy from China, test it themselves and say, yeah, this, these guys sent me real
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   stuff.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.120]   And that's what I'm hoping to share with you.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.720]   Until then, that's just the state of the nation here when it comes to getting raw C60.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.880]   And I wanted to get that out and put it out there for you because I know you're probably
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.440]   wondering about it as well.
