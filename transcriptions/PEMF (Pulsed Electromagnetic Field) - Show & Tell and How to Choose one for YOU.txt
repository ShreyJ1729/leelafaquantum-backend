[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   So, this is a response video about PMF devices, somebody on the bioelectric healing telegram
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.260]   chat group asked me about the type of PMF devices that I own and some advice on how to go and
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.880]   select one for themselves.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.160]   So I'm just going to do a little bit of YouTube show and tell and kind of explain to you what
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.980]   I use and why I have these devices and then kind of explain more when I get on my computer
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.660]   about, you know, how you would go about trying to determine what would be the best device
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.660]   for you.
[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.780]   Because at the end of the day, PMF stands for Pulse Electromagnetic Field and it's can
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.440]   be applied in a multitude of different ways and there are numerous different devices out
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.440]   there.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.500]   So to each person who wants or is interested in getting one, you really need to sit and
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.100]   think about, you know, what are you getting it for?
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.380]   And so this is kind of why I want to show you what I have.
[00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.860]   So right now, this is one of my oldest models.
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.020]   I've had this forever.
[00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.020]   This is the magnetic pulser from soda instruments.
[00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.020]   It's the MPG4.
[00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.580]   They're up to MPG6 now, I believe.
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.580]   And so this is considered a paddle.
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.420]   Well, obviously it's a paddle, right?
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.460]   So this is a paddle magnetic pulser inside this paddle is a big old pancake coil and
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.260]   basically this thing will pulse every few seconds until it gets too hot and then turn
[00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.260]   itself off.
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.380]   And the whole point of using this is to accompany the Bob Beck protocol in which it needed a
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.580]   PMF pulse to get to your, I believe it was your lymph nodes in order to get to the deep
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.340]   rooted viruses that hide out in your lymph nodes, which blood electrification cannot do.
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.420]   The blood just doesn't get there that far.
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.100]   So the whole point of me getting this originally was for just that purpose for the Bob Beck
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.300]   protocol.
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.380]   But then I've also known that you could also, because of this thing, it's pretty strong,
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:02.780]   you can also use this for just general types of issues like sore muscles and things like
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.780]   that.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.460]   And also too, because one of the things about a pulsed electromagnetic field is that it
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.540]   causes something called electroporation of your cellular walls that makes them more permeable
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.500]   for things to kind of soak into them.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.820]   So if you, let's say, I use this on my dog, for instance, because it's really hard to
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.820]   do the Beck protocol on a dog, but one time like she got leptosprosis, which is drinking
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.860]   water out of a stream in Hawaii when they have rat feces, and it gets like E. coli contaminated.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.940]   And the dog gets really bad diarrhea.
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.460]   So the best way to treat the dog, in my opinion, was to give her a clodal silver.
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.780]   And then I basically electroprated her intestines while I was, after I gave her the clodal silver
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.900]   to kind of just help her absorb the silver ions deeper into her body and into her digestive
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.900]   system.
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.900]   And it worked really well.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.060]   You know, and she was better the very next day.
[00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.300]   So the whole idea though is that the paddle pulsers is one version of PMF, and this is
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.740]   one of the things that I own, show and tell.
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.180]   The other one that I own is the E-pulse 8000, and it's also, there's also, there's lots
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.620]   of different models of this thing, it's huge, weighs 60 pounds.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.060]   And what it's for, and I originally got this for my horse, when I used to have a horse.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.500]   And so it's got this big old coil, and to kind of give you an idea, I think this one
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.980]   I forget, I think it's like, I don't know, 3500 gals or something like that, in terms
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.860]   of strength, the magnetic fields are measured in gals.
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.740]   And then when you get really high, they're measured in a measurement called Tesla.
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:47.060]   This thing right here pumps out a pulse, you know, like a, just pulses, like pulse, pulse,
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.060]   right?
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.500]   And it kicks out a pulse about two Tesla.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.260]   It's so strong, it's meant for a horse, right?
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.900]   But it's so strong that you can't put this anywhere near your head.
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.740]   And also too, but I just got to warn you, you cannot have implants.
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.020]   If you've got pacemakers, or you've got those things they put in your head, or anything
[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:10.220]   else that regulates your body, you've got electronics in you, never, never, never use
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.860]   a PMF device, no matter how big it is, it is just way too dangerous, especially this.
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.780]   This would probably kill that person.
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.980]   But the idea behind this though, is it's meant for a 2000 pound critter, where you can put
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:30.020]   it, you know, and it's meant for basically increasing because of electroporation, right?
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.380]   Because of electroporation, it increases the oxygen saturation of the blood.
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.340]   So a lot of horse trainers will use this, and actually, you know, like, there was a couple
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.340]   of derbies ago, Kentucky derbies, and I remember distinctly reading an article, where there
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:52.260]   was like 18 horses that were competing and 16 of them used a pulse, an electro pulse,
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.180]   you know, PMF therapy, just like this using one of these types of machines, 16 out of
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.860]   18 for the Kentucky Derby.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.620]   And what it did was, it increases the rate of oxygen saturation in the blood, so they
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.540]   would use it before the race, and then after the race, you know, your muscles are tense,
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:14.260]   and you know, you've kind of had a hard workout, they'll use the coils on the horse again after
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.380]   to help improve the rate of recovery of the muscles, and you know, and release the tension
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.380]   and things like that.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.380]   And it works too.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.460]   I mean, there's been many times where I've had like, you know, strenuous workouts, where
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.780]   I've had bad leg days, where your legs are just like, you know, they're just twitching.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.380]   Tilt the coil on your legs, on my legs, and you know, and basically run it for about,
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.580]   you know, 15 minutes, there's a timer here, turn on, on a switch, and so forth, and it
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.540]   would definitely, I mean, you would literally not feel any pain and you'd be fine the next
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.580]   day, and if you didn't, you know, I need to be all stiff and stuff, so that's what this
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.580]   is for.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.380]   You can use an auto-human, but again, not a human who's got any type of electronics inside
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:00.820]   them, and never near your head, and be real careful around joints, because it will jar
[00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.820]   you.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.420]   So the best thing to do with a coil is, you know, around big areas of your body, and
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.300]   then if you have like, you know, like around joints and things like that, you want to put
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.860]   a thick towel between you and the coil, so you're not as close to it.
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.780]   But yeah, this works really, really good.
[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.340]   These units are pretty hardcore, you know, these average around like 12 grand each.
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.360]   I got this for a great deal for eight grand brand new.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.180]   These guys run about 350, really great, works great for the back protocol, and then the
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.020]   other one, I've got a third one now, and this is the, what do you call this?
[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:48.180]   This is the TDHP10/MHPP10 magnetic pulser from Information Unlimited website amazingone.com.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.940]   And anyway, so these guys are just a bunch of electronic engineer guys who invent stuff
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.100]   and sell it.
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.300]   And so I was really interested in this.
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.300]   This is a very different kind of magnetic pulser.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.700]   This guy just puts out a magnetic pulse.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.940]   This guy just puts out a magnetic pulse.
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:11.580]   This guy puts out a magnetic pulse using these things called, well, they're called pancake
[00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.540]   coils, right, and you plug the coils in and then not only does it put out a pulse, and
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.580]   you can actually turn the pulse up or down in terms of strength.
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.580]   You can also send a frequency through the pulse so you can dial in a frequency.
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.440]   So this is called, you know, for lack of a better phrase, this is called a frequency
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.060]   specific PMF device.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.460]   And so that's the really big difference here between this and the other two is that you
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.940]   can actually transmit a frequency using this one.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.740]   And this one's experimental.
[00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.700]   This is just for people who want to learn.
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.540]   I mean, you could use it for therapy.
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.340]   You could pick any type of frequency.
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.700]   I've tried several different ones.
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.260]   You can use this for, this is also being used for dream research right now.
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.140]   You put the pancake coil under the pillow, run different frequencies.
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:01.320]   You can also, I got a set of LED lights that go with this thing so you can actually plug
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.500]   the LED lights in there and have the pulses matching the light blinking to do brain studies
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.980]   and things like that, you know, so it's pretty cool.
[00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.180]   But anyway, so this is kind of like my toy.
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.460]   I've used this several times just trying to see what it can do.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.300]   And so far I haven't had, you know, really found a use case, but it is cool because,
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.140]   you know, you could just, you know, you could just like kind of like a, if you have a spooky
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.700]   two, the spooky two has a coil on it, like a pancake coil, I mean, like a paddle coil,
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.140]   I mean, and it can also transmit frequencies through.
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.620]   So this can do that as well.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.540]   Lots of different things you can do with it, but it's more so like my toy.
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.220]   But those are the three that I own.
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.780]   So let's go ahead and take a look at what other PMF devices are out there.
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.780]   Okay.
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:52.100]   So now in terms of what other types of PMF devices are out on the market, this is just
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:57.340]   an image search on DuckDuckGo that kind of just shows you all of the different types
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.780]   of models that are out there.
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.060]   So, you know, it is, you know, for anyone who's like interested in PMF therapy and wondering
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.660]   what device to get, yeah, it's not going to be a simple search.
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:11.660]   The best thing I could suggest is that if you're interested in PMF, these things are
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.660]   not cheap.
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:18.320]   So I would suggest that, you know, you would go to like a chiropractor, try it out to see
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:24.380]   if it works for you and then depending on what type of device that they're using, you
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:29.100]   know, and that works for you might be a good solution for you and or probably cheaper just
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.340]   to get treatments versus buying your own.
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.620]   But I do want to point out again that these are the multiple different types of devices
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.740]   that are out there.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.620]   You can see from these pictures right here, these are these big, you know, these big giant
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.220]   ones like I have that I have for horses and or, you know, they're for people as well.
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.480]   They have the coil like this.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.060]   This is just the office, you know, the on the shelf model of this.
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.860]   This is portable.
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.100]   This puts out the same level of energy.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.660]   It's called the PMF 120 and it also uses coils.
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.660]   You can put coils around now.
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.700]   It's not as strong as the one made for horses.
[00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.540]   You can put around your neck and sort and things like that.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:08.540]   You can treat like basically, I guess this lady right here is treating like, you know,
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.300]   basically tennis elbow, you can treat organs and things like that.
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:18.020]   Now so there's basically, I would call like the coil models, the PMF 120s, the PMF 8000s.
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.040]   You know, they have basically big coils.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.140]   That's what those are for.
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.980]   Now the other ones that you can see are out there are these pads where you either lay
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.500]   on them or there are small pads that you can apply directly to a certain, you know, area
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.900]   of your body.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:39.780]   So their pad ones are very beneficial for like very, very low energy pulses.
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.660]   And some of them have, you can put a frequency into the pulse itself.
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.660]   And those are meant to be more therapeutic as opposed to treating injuries.
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.380]   And so you can basically do long term treatments for all sorts of different kinds of issues.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.460]   And that's the thing too that I really want to point out is that again, you know, it depends
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.180]   on what you're trying to address.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.100]   But sometimes if you get a pad, it's way different than a coil.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.100]   And then you've got these little guys right here, I want to, like this guy's here is the
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.540]   earth pulse.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:12.980]   It's just got, it's like that, the TDH from the one I showed you with the pancake coils.
[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.820]   It itself has a pancake coil.
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.820]   You'd put it on your pillow, put it under a body part and lay on it for a while as opposed
[00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.320]   to laying on a pad.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.340]   You know, it's the same thing, except the pads you're doing, your whole body, obviously,
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:30.100]   a little coil or a smaller pad, you're doing up, you know, targeting an area of your body.
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:34.220]   Then you've got these guys right here that's like the Miramates, I forgot what this other
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.020]   one's called.
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:41.220]   And these kinds of ones now are where you want to treat, again, you can do targeted treatments
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.580]   for specific areas of your body.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.340]   So clearly not your whole body, you know, but you can see how you can get really, really
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.500]   small and target or you can get like a pad that you can lay on or you can put your, you
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.740]   know, your pillow and so forth.
[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.940]   So there's lots of different models and all sorts of different ones.
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.180]   And so one of the things that I would recommend, if you're out there looking for one and you're
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.020]   wondering, you know, should I get one that I lay on, should I get one that's a coil,
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:11.620]   you know, then really, I would suggest that you start, go to Google Scholar, all right,
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:18.020]   and type in PMF and, and you know, you see, PMF and, and you see all these different ones.
[00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.420]   Yeah, it's basically, you can find studies on, at, at Google Scholar, that's just what
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.420]   Google Scholar does.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.340]   It's like the search engine for science studies and science articles.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.820]   And if you type in PMF and let's say you've got whatever your issue might be, you've got,
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:37.380]   you know, depression, cancer, you want issues with sleep, inflammation, prostate and more,
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:42.060]   you could type in anything and you're going to basically find information about that.
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.740]   So that's kind of where I would say you should start.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.020]   And so let's just say like, I have issues with sleep, right?
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.220]   So I want to improve my sleep.
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:55.340]   And this is what I just did actually, we're currently doing PMF week on telegram.
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:01.540]   And so, you know, in my research for doing the week long series on PMF on telegram, you
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.900]   know, I got issues with sleep.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.380]   I've had issues with sleep forever.
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.060]   And so I found this article and it's really kind of cool.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.820]   It's his website on the, and it's by Dr. Pollock.
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:16.460]   And so I was reading this, this article and it covered a lot of very specific studies
[00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.300]   that had been done.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.060]   And so really that's the modality, you know, that's the methodology that I would highly
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:27.700]   recommend, find what your specific issue is, find what people have, you know, scientists
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:34.700]   have studied PMF in relationship to that issue, and then figure out what they learned and
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.860]   what works for them.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.060]   And in this study, if you read this study and you've got issues with sleep, they determined
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:46.820]   that a solid pulse or a PMF pulse of three Hertz was what was actually that had the best
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.980]   results and a double blind placebo study with people having issues with sleep, getting
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.060]   to sleep, staying asleep and waking up, you know, not, not waking up early.
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.780]   And so that was the thing that was really fascinating.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.900]   I was reading this thing and I'm like, oh, wow.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.460]   And so they had all the studies, all the science was there.
[00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.500]   And they just said, hey, you know what?
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.340]   And then Dr. Pollock, which by the way, I want to just say that this guy, this older
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.940]   guy right here, let me show him right here, this guy right there, Dr.
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:15.380]   He is like the PMF guru, been around for decades and he is really solid.
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.700]   And the cool thing about Pollock that I really, really like is that he just doesn't represent
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.700]   one brand.
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.580]   You know, he's just not trying to sell you one thing.
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:27.420]   He's got multiple different units that do multiple different things, just like I said,
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.420]   right?
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:34.940]   And so he's going to recommend to you what is best for you, not whatever he's selling.
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:39.020]   Like if you've ever took a look at the book, the PMF book, okay, at the end of the book,
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.380]   the guy ends up, you know, disclosing he's a rep for a certain product.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.500]   And all he talks about at the end of the book is his product.
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.340]   So the book PMF is literally an infomercial.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.940]   I mean, he's got great information all the way to the last chapter, you know, about PMF
[00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.460]   in general and all the science behind it and it's really a good reference.
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.300]   But at the end, you know, the guy's pushing his product and you can't blame him.
[00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.300]   That's what he's trying to do, you know, but this Dr. Pollock is different.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.020]   He's got multiple different products.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.980]   So he's not going to just push you the one he reps for.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.260]   He's going to push you the one that's the best fit for you, you know, hey, people got
[00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.260]   to make a living, right?
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.460]   But anyway, so as I was reading this, this site, basically, he's basically saying this
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.460]   is all the studies.
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:17.460]   This is what works.
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.460]   This is work.
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.460]   You know, this is what shows will work.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.900]   And so that got me personally perked into like, oh, wow, okay, well, on then my first
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.180]   question is like, well, I could take my experimental one, you know, dial it down to three, put
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.540]   it under my pillow and try it.
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.380]   And yes, I'm going to.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.980]   Or you can just buy the one that's recommended by Dr. Pollock and said, this is the one that
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.140]   works for that.
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.140]   And there you go.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:43.180]   So it's clearly you can see how it's so important to know what you want and then getting some
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.940]   professional advice as to what the best device is for that.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.620]   Now, let's say if I had acute back pain, you know, and you know, that happens, right?
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:57.220]   So if I were to say, you know, PMF and back pain, you know, I'm just just throwing it
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.220]   out there.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.820]   I don't know if I'll find actual back pain, but you might, you know, or just say pain.
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.220]   Oh, there you go.
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.580]   See PMF back pain.
[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.580]   And so there you go.
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.340]   Here's PMF effectiveness and lower back pain.
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.500]   And then you read through the clinical trial and you read through the science studies and
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:18.100]   says, hey, this is what worked and not just what worked, but how was it frequency specific?
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.420]   Was it coils?
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.420]   Was it pads?
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.140]   Was it, you know, you know, so forth or you get my point.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.580]   So that's the whole point.
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.660]   So if you want to know, right, what's the best one for you?
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:32.240]   Go look in school or scholar, figure out what works in the studies and then go hunting
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.380]   for the device that's specific.
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.140]   And again, I do recommend Dr. Pollock.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.740]   By the way, I have no affiliation.
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.460]   I don't make any money making this video.
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.420]   I don't sell any PMF products.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:45.980]   It's just something that as you can see, I have, I have them and I use them and I swear
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.980]   by them.
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.540]   There's a soda one right there.
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.540]   So there you go.
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.420]   And so I just wanted to share that with everybody.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:57.740]   And this is my show until what I have in PMF devices and my recommendation on how on the
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.940]   best way to go find what's right for you.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.500]   And I hope you do find what's right for you.
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.620]   And if you're interested in PMF, we're still doing it.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.520]   It's like what Thursday today?
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.620]   We're doing PEMF week, which means every single day I'm posting a bunch of stuff about
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.620]   PEMF.
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:15.420]   So on Monday, it was like, what is PEMF or not Monday, but Tuesday is the first day
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.420]   of the week.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:22.440]   The second day, I think we did, or I did, oh, PEMF studies, a whole bunch of studies
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:26.620]   that came off of Goulish Gagler, you know, scholar, like, you know, PMF or ossoprosis,
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:30.300]   PMF for diabetes, PMF for cancer, you know, that sort of thing.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:37.380]   And then today I did a whole series of posts about PEMF for pets and for livestock.
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.660]   And it's, you know, and showing videos about how to use it on a horse, how to use it, you
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.420]   know, on dogs and things like that.
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:49.780]   And a study by a veterinarian, you know, a medical association on the use of PEMF and
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.500]   the medical and the veterinarian field.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:56.060]   So, you know, so every day I'm posting a lot of stuff about PEMF.
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:00.980]   And so I just wanted to throw this out there as part of PEMF week that this is what I have
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.860]   and this is how you choose what's best for you.
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:04.860]   And good luck.
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:09.300]   I hope that you do find what helps you and I hope that you feel better by doing it.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.300]   All right.
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.020]   So, thank you and have a great day.
