[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.800]   I'm your host Kay Elmer and in this video I'd like to share with you a remarkable and
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.520]   fascinating story of the black box.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.720]   Now some of you have seen my other videos, you know that I have this passion for bioelectrical
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.280]   magnetics as it relates to health and healing.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.000]   I know that's odd, it's just my thing and I've been doing this for a couple of decades
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   now.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.320]   I've collected numerous devices, tinkered around with them and it's all about how people can
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.720]   use bioelectrics for health and healing and wellness and treatment and curing, all sorts
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.820]   of different things that, you know, that ail us as human beings.
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.000]   And you know this story of the black box is by far one of the most interesting stories
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.960]   because it has this wide bizarre cast of characters in the story and a lot of the amazing things
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.320]   that were discovered in creating this device called the black box, further named the brain
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.560]   tuner, is that it was kind of discovered by accident and then further refined and then
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.320]   it's actually a commercial product available today and the story is amazing because of
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.920]   what it can do.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.360]   So let me just jump right into the story now, I hope you can enjoy this and then stick out
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.920]   to the end and find out more about it.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.920]   So here we go.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.440]   Now, first question I want to ask you is what is what can name three things that Peter Townsend
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.160]   of the who, Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton, who played with Derek
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.240]   and the dominoes back in the day, what are the three things that these gentlemen have
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.240]   in common?
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.640]   I'll give you one second to kind of think about what they have in common.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.680]   So obviously, rock and roll, but what are the other two things?
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.240]   Well if you guessed addiction, that's one of them, you're right.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.560]   It's rock and roll addiction and Meg Patterson, Dr. Margaret Patterson, who lived from 1922
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:17.960]   to 2002, is a doctor, a brilliant young surgeon in her day from Scotland and how the story
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:25.200]   begins is she ended up working as the head of surgery for a hospital called Tongguah
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.520]   in Hong Kong back in the 70s.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.880]   And as she was the head of surgery, one of her other surgeons, a doctor, Wen, who was
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.080]   working at the hospital at the time, had gone to mainland China to study electro-acupuncture
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.680]   for pain management.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.400]   And so in his research and in his training, he brought back to the hospital, an electro-acupuncture
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.080]   device and started treating patients for pain.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:04.480]   In that process, what they discovered was amazing because at the time back in the day,
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.600]   the hospital, roughly the patients there, about 15% of the patients were also heroin
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.080]   addicts.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.960]   And so after some time that Dr. Wen was using this therapy, the addicts, the patients that
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.880]   were heroin addicts, started to report to the doctor that their addiction to heroin
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.160]   had gone away.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.040]   And so the first one that reported it, they thought it was a fluke or they just kind of
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.280]   discounted it.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.400]   And then another person came along and said that their addiction was cured and it just
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.440]   kept happening.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.560]   So this accidental discovery of all of a sudden realizing that this device that Dr. Wen had
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.960]   brought back from China was curing people over their addiction, had perked the interest
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.120]   of the head of surgery in Dr. Margaret Patterson, who then kind of made it her life's work
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.960]   to kind of understand what is happening and how does this work.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.160]   And so what Margaret Patterson did during the '70s was she started doing clinical trials
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.640]   and researching and studying the effects of electroacupuncture or the effect of bioelectricity
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.040]   on the effect of the brain as to how it was helping people cure their addictions.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.680]   And so she started tinkering around with the device.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.920]   And eventually she ended up taking her, you know, what she had discovered, all the different
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.720]   things that she found that worked, you know, obviously cast away what doesn't work, but
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.040]   she took what worked, went to a medical device to manufacture in Hong Kong and developed
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.800]   something she called the black box.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.560]   And here she's pictured with one of the original ones, it eventually became something that looked
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.120]   like this and started using it on patients.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.760]   And so some of the research that she had done was incredibly remarkable.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.680]   And just to kind of share with you a couple of them, there was actually a couple of papers
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.440]   that were published and actually four of them that I could find in the medical literature
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.880]   that covered the use of her device, which she eventually ended up calling neuroelectric
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.160]   therapy or net for short.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.160]   And so now here's what's just absolutely amazing about this black box that she ended
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.680]   up putting together as she was, you know, over the years as she started, you know, tinkering
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.040]   around with how to, you know, how to go about doing this and how did it work.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.880]   And so one of the papers that covers the results was written in 1984, and the paper is called
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:43.840]   treatment of progressive, or, you know, I guess progressive, alcohol nicotine addiction
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.720]   with neuroelectric therapy.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.960]   And it was an analysis of results over seven years.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.160]   And so here's the thing that's just unbelievable.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.880]   She developed this black box off of what Dr. Wen had brought back to Hong Kong.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.520]   And the studies that had been concluded over the 70s was one of them was 186 patients had
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:11.200]   undergone treatment with the black box and 98% were successfully detoxified.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:18.160]   And what I mean by that is she didn't ever consider the black box as a cure for addiction.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.520]   She considered and she called it rapid detoxification.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.800]   In other words, she found a way that under 30 days with treatment of a little black box
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.360]   that would send a current and a frequency through the brain from electrodes attached
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:40.400]   to each ear would basically alleviate a patient's desire for whatever they were addicted to,
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.560]   primarily in this case, heroin, alcohol, you know, nicotine, that sort of thing.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:52.280]   But the thing was in her clinical trials, she discovered that the use of this device
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:59.400]   for detoxification was 98% successful with patients having a marked feeling of well-being
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.640]   and no cravings and 95% of them or anxiety and 75%.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.240]   Now her detailed assessments of abstinence syndrome in the net program are given in the
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:16.920]   study and of 50% response to follow up, you know, after the initial treatment, after the
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:23.880]   first 30 days, 78% remained addiction free, 80% of them were drug addicts.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.680]   And after one to eight years after a net, they continued to do follow up studies and
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.100]   the numbers remained the same.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:37.080]   In other words, this thing not only eliminated a person's addiction, but it lasted, which
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.640]   is one of the biggest issues with treatment for addiction, as you can imagine, right?
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.880]   I mean, people who are addicted fall back into it and they continually go to rehab and
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.880]   so forth.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:53.520]   But this was a remarkable achievement for something that was completely a drug free
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.280]   treatment, you know, as opposed to how addiction is treated today.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.320]   And so although average time and rehabilitation was only 16 days, the alcohol, marijuana,
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:08.800]   and cigarette use were decreased in 64% of the patient population and diminished substance
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.880]   was reported in 76%.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:19.000]   So these are unbelievable numbers in the treatment of addiction, documented in this study that
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.440]   Dr. Patterson had conducted.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:29.280]   And also in 1992, another study was done for the neuroelectric therapy for the addiction
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.120]   detoxification.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:40.280]   And by the end of the treatment, 102 patients, 95% of them claim they were free of craving,
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.680]   75% that they were free of anxiety.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.800]   And what's most amazing is the net program had a reported dropout rate of 1.6% over a
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:56.040]   period of seven years and what that means is only 1.6% of the people fell back into
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.040]   their habits.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.080]   And now if you're seeing these numbers and you can, by the way, links to everything in
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.480]   the video description below, all of the papers, all of the websites.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.000]   This was an absolute amazing discovery.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.960]   And it's all credited to Dr. Patterson, who named her little box, the brain tuner, instead
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.040]   of the black box.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.960]   Now what's interesting though, and this is where the next chapter of the story comes
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.960]   into play.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.560]   And oh, by the way, if you did want to learn a little bit more about Meg Patterson, I'm
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.160]   not sure who actually runs this website, but they have somebody put together a website
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.000]   dedicated to Dr. Patterson about her neuroelectric therapy.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.220]   So if you wanted to know more about this, links in the video description below, there's
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:49.040]   this website that talks about her and about neuroelectric therapy and the books that she
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.280]   wrote, the papers that were created or that were written about the work.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.040]   But she wrote the book, Addictions Can Be Cured, Getting Off the Hook and Hooked.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:04.520]   And so you could just see, it became her lifelong work in helping people overcome addiction.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:11.240]   So the next chapter of the story comes into play, which is another fascinating chapter
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:16.880]   of the story, is that the magazine, if you remember the magazine, Omni, I don't know
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:23.600]   if it's still around, but January of 1983, there was an article about Dr. Patterson and
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:31.000]   the black box and it was the title of the article in this January 1983 edition of Omni Magazine,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.440]   linked in the video description, you want to read it yourself.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.720]   It's quite a long article, 12 pages, but it basically was an article called the black
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.720]   box.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.240]   And that's how the story came to light, actually, and how I kind of learned about it was the
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.840]   black box, the secret drug treatment of the superstars, the rock superstars.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.440]   And that's how it all came together.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:58.320]   Now, if you remember, if we talk about Peter Townsend, the who, these are some really famous
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.320]   rock stars, Keith Richards and Eric Clanton, well, when they found out, somehow they found
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.240]   out and it doesn't say in the article how they found out about Dr. Patterson's work.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.800]   But because she was from Scotland, in the United Kingdom, they found out about her work.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.640]   And so Peter Townsend was the first rock star to approach Meg, we'll just call this call
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.400]   her Meg, but Dr. Patterson, and this is what she looked like back in the day.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.080]   In those days, right?
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:28.000]   They approached, you know, Peter Townsend approached Dr. Patterson and asked for some help.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.680]   Now he had at the time, and this is actually his story, this is a picture of what the device
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.360]   originally looked like, but here's Peter Townsend, and he's talking about the black
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.880]   box and they interviewed her, they interviewed him.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.560]   And to say, you know, what he basically, his story was was, you know, he was playing for
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.600]   the who and back in the day, you know, all the rock stars were, you know, as you can imagine,
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.000]   they were all, you know, addicted to something and they were pretty much stoned and drunk
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.360]   half the time.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:00.320]   But anyway, so after about a two year alcoholic binge, Peter Townsend was almost near death,
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.120]   and he realized he had to do something to save his life.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.560]   So he approached Dr. Patterson, he had heard of his work, her work somehow, and then he
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.600]   approached her and she treated him.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.320]   And so he treated him and it cured him of his alcohol addiction.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:18.840]   Well, word got around to the other rock stars that, you know, that Peter had gotten cured.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.360]   And so next thing you know, Keith Richards approached her and he was helped and then Eric
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.640]   Clapton was helped.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.720]   And the list goes on and she actually even helped Boyd, Georgia, if you remember that
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.160]   guy, you know, cure him of his addiction back in the 80s.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.880]   And so she was really became kind of like her nickname was the rock and roll doctor after
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:43.920]   a while because all of these big stars were going to her to help them, you know, get overcome
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.400]   their addictions.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.640]   So the story goes, and this is the thing I want to point out a couple of things about
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.640]   this article.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.240]   And of course, it's a long article, I won't go over the whole thing.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.200]   But I do want to kind of point out something that Peter says I think is really profound
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.240]   in the idea of how this thing works.
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.400]   And so here's a quote from Peter Townsend.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.600]   And he basically said, I mean, as he was, you know, being interviewed about his treatment
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:11.200]   and his overcoming his alcohol addiction, he basically said, you know, gradually through
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:16.640]   though, you know, your mood levels, your mood levels off so that by the 10th of day, you
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.480]   feel fairly normal.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.720]   In retrospect, I realized that the treatment is an education in itself net, re educates
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.880]   the brain to produce its own drugs.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.200]   And in the process, you learn something about your human potential.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:35.080]   You come to realize that somewhere within you is the power to deal with crises, tension
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.600]   and frustrations.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:42.280]   So the treatment reaffirms one faith in the self healing process.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:48.280]   And in that statement that he makes, it really profoundly defines exactly how this process
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.280]   works.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:56.760]   Because what they've discovered since then is that by pulsing a frequency at a particular
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:03.280]   modulation and pulse width and amperage and frequency, there's all these different variables.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.440]   And that's why it's taken so long to develop it and perfect this technology in helping
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:15.440]   people overcome addictions, which is what Dr. Patterson's work is all about, was the idea
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:22.280]   though that the brain itself produces all of these chemicals for you and that all of these
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.760]   drugs and even things like, you know, people are addicted to video games now or on social
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.760]   media now.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.440]   But what all that does is triggering your brain to producing these chemicals so that
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:37.760]   your brain itself is the holy grail of your own health.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:43.640]   And if you could trigger your brain to do what it needs to do to help you overcome an
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:50.400]   addiction or overcome stress, overcome anxiety, then by the use of this device, it rewires
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.760]   your brain to do what it's supposed to do because it's been messed up by addiction.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.800]   And that's how it works.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   So it's kind of like there's all these little secrets that come out about the brain, about
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.760]   electrotherapy and things like that, that came from the story of the black box.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.520]   So but the one thing I want to really kind of mention in this story and there's a lot
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:18.760]   of different testimonials and the whole story of the black box is the statement by Dr. Patterson.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.960]   And then she wanted to make sure that, you know, she stated in the article that she didn't
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.520]   call it a cure.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.720]   And I think that's another important point to take away from this story is although there
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:35.960]   was some incredibly remarkable results from her work is that it wasn't a cure in her mind
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:42.840]   to Dr. Patterson that the most, if that the treatment of neuroelectric therapy was most
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:49.920]   effective when backed up by counseling, remedial training and a supportive home environment.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.240]   And I think that's really an important thing that, you know, there's, it's not, it wasn't
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:58.920]   considered, even by the inventor, Dr. Patterson, it wasn't considered a cure, it was considered
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.920]   part of a cure.
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.840]   And it took kind of like this full court press of all these different, you know, pieces to
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:10.080]   kind of make sure that people not only overcome their addiction, but they also then, you know,
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.720]   continued to be successful in life after their addictions was where we're addressed.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.680]   So that's the story of Dr. Patterson and her remarkable discovery.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.400]   And you know, she passed away in 2002 and her work is being carried on.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.720]   And now, you know, a neuroelectric therapy is something that you can go and research
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:33.520]   and have, you know, and get help with if you know someone or you yourself have some kind
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.680]   of an addiction.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.760]   But here's what's really interested, interesting.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:45.480]   That 1983 article in Omni Magazine came to the attention of another tinker.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:54.120]   And so here comes in the story, 10 years later, roughly, here comes the master tinker.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.320]   Another gentleman called his name is Dr. Robert Beck.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.240]   Now, he was not a doctor of medicine like Dr. Patterson.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.720]   He actually held a doctorate in electrical engineering and he was an inventor and a consultant.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.920]   And he very successful in his own right.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.880]   And what he did was he had been introduced to the article and, you know, somewhat a friend
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.200]   of his told him about the article.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.200]   He read it and then he contacted Dr. Patterson and they became friends.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.360]   And so what he did and because he's a tinker and he's got this, he was he had these one
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.560]   of those crazy individuals with an insatiable curiosity.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:35.680]   And so he upon learning about Dr. Patterson's work, you know, basically started working with
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:41.480]   her and took her idea and he went off and took it to a whole other level.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.920]   And so he started doing his own research and his own clinical trials and he started tinker
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:51.960]   around because what Dr. Patterson was, you know, she was a surgeon, right?
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:58.440]   And so she was approaching the concept of using these devices for addiction from the
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:04.880]   standpoint of the patients and the treatment programs and the protocols and also trying
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.680]   to figure out, you know, what was the best treatment for each individual one.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.600]   Like example, the black box, it had all these different dials.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.320]   If you look at it, there's all these little different dials on it.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:20.000]   And the black box, basically, she discovered that, you know, certain different types of
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.480]   addictions like narcotics and sedatives, you know, 75 hertz to 300 hertz frequency would
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.480]   work on those.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:32.560]   But, you know, if you had, if somebody, if a patient had a cocaine or amphetamines addiction,
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.440]   then you needed to ramp up the frequency up to around 2000 hertz.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.560]   So it was kind of like this device that you had to kind of tweak around with and you had
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:46.720]   to be really, you know, really, really experienced in using it and it was using a clinical medical
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.920]   practice by the doctor.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.360]   And so what Dr. Beck was really fascinated about was like, Hey, you know, could you take
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:58.120]   that into the next level and create a little device where you could just give it to, you
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:03.320]   know, give it to the customer or the, I'm sorry, the patient or the patient can purchase one
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:08.640]   and then use it all the time because one of the things that came from Dr. Patterson's
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:15.600]   research was that there was a higher success rate within patient than outpatient, you know,
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.600]   in terms of treatment.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:21.600]   So, you know, people that were, you know, using it all the time, you know, the more appointments
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.320]   they went to, the better their results, right?
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.520]   And so what Dr. Beck thought was, Hey, you know what?
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:32.200]   Why don't we see if we could just refine the technology and get it so that people could
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.520]   just have it with them at all, at all the time and all the time because Dr. Patterson's
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:42.120]   black box, because it was a medical device, even though it was not FDA approved, the medical
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.480]   device was thousands of dollars at the time.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:51.640]   I believe it was around $1,000 back in 1980 something, which, you know, with inflation, that's
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.520]   like a $3,000 device and they were looking at, you know, you know, because the medical
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.520]   field, right?
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:02.440]   They were like charging doctors $50,000 and stuff to use these devices and have a lease
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.280]   to use them and all that.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.040]   And so it was just really, really one of those things where it was like, you know, only doctors
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.040]   could use it.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.640]   So Dr. Beck wanted to go, Hey, you know, how could we get this and release it to the general
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.640]   public?
[00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.440]   How could we make how could we make it cheap enough so that people could to have access
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:23.320]   to that so they're not only, you know, rich rock stars and people with a lot of money
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:28.920]   and insurance could have access to these, you know, to these therapy to help them with
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.920]   their addiction.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.000]   But how do you take that to the common person?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.080]   Because there's probably a lot more, well, there, you know, there's a lot more people
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:41.320]   that are on the lower end of the income stream who have addictions than, you know, than the
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.560]   people have a lot of money.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.760]   So that was his thing.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.480]   He wanted to bring it to the people and he was in his whole background, it was just,
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.800]   you know, open sourcing everything and trying to help people, you know, help humanity.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.000]   And so he took Dr. Patterson's work and he started to really tweak on that.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.760]   And so one of the things that came to light, and this is how I actually found out about
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.920]   this whole story was listening to a lecture.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.160]   Now this is available on YouTube and link below in the description was he had a lecture
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:15.380]   that he gave about his, the story about how he came upon the article and became friends
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:19.740]   with Dr. Patterson, and then how he started to do his own work on that.
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:25.000]   And so this article here has also been summarized on a website that was dedicated to Bob.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.340]   Now Bob died in 2002.
[00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.260]   And so there's been people that have picked up his work and there's an entire website
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.260]   dedicated to Dr. Beck.
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:37.340]   And so on this website, you can learn a lot about what he's done, especially in the area
[00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:39.260]   of the brain tuner right here.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.340]   And in this area of the brain tuner, there's this one document that I think is really,
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:49.380]   really quite helpful and it's basically someone put together the manuscript or the transcript
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.580]   and created an ebook out of it so that you can learn about the brain tuner and the work
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:57.860]   of Dr. Beck on Dr. Patterson's invention.
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:04.260]   And so in his lecture, and this is the actual, you know, basically it's the document, the
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.900]   notes of the lecture that he gave, you know, he talks all about, you can either listen
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:13.580]   to the video, obviously, listen to the lecture or read the document, it's the same thing.
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.660]   But I kind of want to point out that, you know, this is what he started to do.
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.380]   He started to reach through that research to all the different frequencies.
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:25.460]   He started to tinker around with how to create a device that would kind of be like a one-stop
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:30.100]   shop instead of having to, you know, tweak a bunch of dials and be a doctor to figure
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:35.220]   out how to use the device, but he could create a device that anybody could use.
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:40.260]   And then, of course, how to use it and what he discovered in his research.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:46.180]   Now, if you take this document, I tossed it into a AI summarizer, just kind of to highlight
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:51.100]   some of the bullet points that I wanted to kind of point out to you because Dr. Beck's
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:59.340]   addition to this incredible discovery was his approaching it as an electrical engineer.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.780]   And so he took the device and he started doing his own trials.
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:06.800]   He worked with different doctors who started doing rat studies and things like that.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:11.460]   And he found that rats, given an electrical stimulation around 111 hertz, were able to
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.820]   recover their neurotransmitter production within 40 minutes.
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:20.300]   Now, these are rats that, you know, the scientists that got hooked on heroin, a little heroin
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:26.500]   addiction rats, but they were using the device and testing the device on rats and discovered
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.860]   that 111 hertz was sort of like that magic number.
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:34.140]   And then what the timeframe was with, you know, they were basically able to cure rats from
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.500]   their addiction in 40 minutes.
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:40.540]   And so he goes on and, you know, he goes on to talk about all the different problems
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.900]   with addiction, the problems with getting FDA medical devices approved, and how if you
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.940]   go that route, it's just incredibly expensive.
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:53.300]   And so, but he goes on to continue to tweak with the device, trying to figure out what
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.660]   the magical frequencies are and the different modulation rates and all of that.
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:02.340]   And so at the end of the day, for some of you tech heads, he came out with this, ultimately,
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:07.260]   with all of his experimenting, which he did for 10 years, or roughly 10 years, was he
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:14.780]   discovered that pulsing at a rate of a thousand hertz modulated at 111 hertz and treatments
[00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:22.660]   between a 25 to 40 minutes was was ideal, you know, for the getting the same results
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:26.540]   that Dr. Patterson had done in a clinical environment, but so he decided to create a
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:27.900]   device for that.
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:32.100]   And of all of the things that he talks about in his lecture that's been written down right
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:38.500]   here in this document, the one of the things I believe is absolutely the most just profound
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:43.380]   discovery was that in his discovery, or you know, basically in his research that he had
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:48.660]   done, here's the thing that I find most interesting, because this is the tinker and he was trying
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:54.100]   to figure out, you know, what's the best frequency and et cetera that would work for this same
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.100]   concept.
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:01.300]   And so right here from the lecture was that in one of his research that he was doing,
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:06.060]   and this was back, you know, he's basically, he was really into biofeedback and in 1969,
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:11.140]   he'd come across a discovery that, you know, because of the invention of the electrolic
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:18.780]   cephalogram, where people could measure brainwaves, they worked at the time that when they actually
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:26.860]   studied, you know, medicine men, shamans, you know, healers, you know, basically take all
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:33.740]   of the the who healers out there, and they took shamans and medicine men, and, and you
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.260]   know, just, you know, all these different types of, you know, like, you know, psychic
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:43.700]   healers and all of these different gurus, and they discovered something that was unbelievable,
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.860]   and that what they discovered was that those individuals, when they were in their healing
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:54.420]   states, they measured the frequency in their brains, and the brains had resonant were resonating
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:26:03.340]   a frequency of 7.83 Hertz, you know, it's a and pure coherent, maybe 20 micro volt signals
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:09.020]   frontal to octopo occipital midline, which is the third eye.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:20.420]   So here's what that means, guys, is his discovery was that the healing state of a, of a healer,
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:27.100]   you know, we're talking about, you know, clairvoyance and these incredible, you know, woo woo guys,
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.100]   right?
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.580]   I'll just, I'll just, you know, and I'm not, I don't mean that derogatory at all, but
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:35.980]   these individuals who had the power to heal people, you know, when they were in their
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:41.020]   healing state, they were resonating at 7.83 Hertz in their brains.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:44.500]   Now, for those of you who know what that number is, guess what?
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:49.220]   That number, that Hertz is the same frequency of the earth.
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.060]   It's called the Schumann residence.
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:56.420]   When you measure the frequency of earth and earth is, has its own frequency, it's exactly
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.300]   7.83.
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:06.980]   So that to me is probably the unbelievable and most profound aspect of the story beyond
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:11.900]   just the fact that they discovered, you know, this little thing from China for pain management,
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.900]   could cure addictions.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:18.540]   That was completely by accident, but at the same time in Dr. Beck's work, he discovered
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:25.700]   that if you could tune your brain to 7.83 Hertz, you would put your brain into a healing
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:31.980]   state and resonate with the earth, you know, and it's just, it's profound because it's
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.700]   the same frequency of the earth.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:40.100]   So he took that information and he built it into a device that he called.
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.260]   He also called it the brain tuner, but he renamed it.
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:46.820]   He didn't want to infringe on, you know, the brain tuner black box name.
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:50.300]   So he then created, he basically called it the bio tuner.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:55.900]   And so here's the highlights of what at the ultimately were his discoveries and his addition
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:03.180]   to the device or to the technology here was he discovered that doing this, you know, electro
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:09.700]   therapy, right, the neural electro therapy using the brain tuner, if he tweaked it to
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:19.020]   his specifications at 111 Hertz and also 7.83 Hertz, right, that it reversed stress related
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:24.900]   symptoms like insomnia, addiction, anxiety and depression with the most troublesome side
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:30.100]   effect of the electro acupuncture is that it stimulates lucid dreaming, which is what
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:34.220]   really caught my eye, you know, when I was, because I bought, I've had one of these for
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.340]   over 10 years and I've tinkered extensively with it.
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.380]   And it was one of the things about it was I was really interested in like, how can I induce
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:46.700]   lucid dreaming, you know, and as you know, as a state, so I used it at night and I would
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.380]   have really bizarre dreams.
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.820]   And then another part of the study that, you know, in the 10 years that Dr. Beck was working
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:58.680]   on the device, he worked with the university of Louisiana and put, you know, had students
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.220]   use these and he found that the students who had had anxiety about their finals performed
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:08.620]   better after the anxiety had been removed, you know, by using the brain tuner because
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.940]   their memory had been restored.
[00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.900]   And since tests were graded against the clock, they were getting higher scores because they
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:19.660]   could recall stuff faster, which was the other thing that I got, you know, I decided, you
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:25.020]   know, I bought one of these things because in my job, you know, it's, you're on, you're
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.020]   on your feet.
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:27.580]   I mean, you have to be sharp and yet.
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:31.420]   And so making sure that my memory was really sharp, you know, using these things before
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:36.180]   big meetings before big presentations to higher ups and so forth.
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.580]   And so I started using this device and I actually got a lot of benefit from it.
[00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:45.260]   And I've also, you know, I also use a lot of brain stimulants in terms of supplements,
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.500]   but that's this is one of the devices that I use is kind of like my little pocket secret.
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:55.620]   And so also one of the things I did want to point out about what Dr. Beck states in his
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.700]   in his lecture was that he said the device I started making, okay, because he achieved
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:00.700]   his goal.
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.260]   That's that's the point of my story.
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:08.060]   Dr. Beck achieved his goal because the device that he started making was a little box with
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:13.420]   a 98 set transistor radio battery that would fix maybe 50 people before the battery ran
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:14.420]   down.
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.300]   And so before, you know, you have to replace it.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.980]   And so naturally, you know, there was a great deal of resistance to this type of technology.
[00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:25.020]   And I want to point out the reason that he makes that little comment is that there's
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.860]   this huge issue.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:32.140]   When they started putting this thing together, they were trying, they were trying to get
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:37.100]   it FDA approved, but Beck did not want to patent it.
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:42.100]   It's if you patent it, then it would prohibit the release of it, you know, like he wanted
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:47.420]   to open source it to the world so that anyone could go and do this for themselves.
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:51.540]   In other words, if you just, you know, if you weren't rich, and you know, you couldn't
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.300]   afford these types of treatments, you know, how do you get help?
[00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.220]   And that's kind of like our healthcare system, right?
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.340]   And so he was against that and this is why I love the guy.
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:05.060]   And so, you know, he talked a lot about, you know, the whole idea of, you know, addiction
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:09.020]   is a multi-billion dollar industry.
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.620]   Think about all the rehab centers, all the doctors.
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:16.780]   You know, if you actually, you know, Google, you know, like what's the standard, you know,
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:21.980]   treatment for, you know, for opioid addiction, which is the problem of our of our generation,
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.980]   right?
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:29.020]   Opio, opioid addiction is just this ravaging communities all, all around America.
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:33.380]   And, you know, you'll find out that, you know, the pharmaceutical companies have sort of
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:38.780]   taken over medical care and that they, the treatment, the standard treatment for opioid
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:45.140]   addiction is drugs, you know, think about how incredibly stupid that is from a common
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:49.780]   sense perspective that, you know, they sell the drugs and you get addicted to them and
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.860]   then they sell you more drugs to get you, you know, to treat you for your addiction and
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.220]   you don't ever really get cured ever.
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.620]   You know, you don't have things like 98%, you know, and so it's just, you know, I have
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:06.300]   this thing where I just really dislike that whole, you know, drug fixes everything concept
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.380]   and so that's why I really have a passion for bioelectric magnetics.
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.380]   But here we go.
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:16.740]   So this is what happened and this is where the next, the next, you know, chapter of this
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:22.620]   amazing story comes along was he refused to patent it because he just, he did not want
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:27.820]   to let the medical industry get a hold of this device and then lock it up so that no
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:31.940]   one could get, have access to it, no one could use it.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:37.740]   And also too, you know, that there was a tremendous amount of backlash because, you know, obviously
[00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:43.740]   if you're in the business of selling billions of dollars worth of services and drugs to
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:49.580]   treat something, i.e. addiction, right, you're going to not want someone to pop out at something
[00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:53.620]   that costs a few hundred bucks and then you don't, you know, ever have to buy any more
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:58.740]   drugs, you know, so that's the whole thing is really, really, you know, competing against
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.780]   that drug, you know, I guess business model.
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:08.700]   And so getting it FDA approved never happened, but then also patenting it never happened
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.900]   either so that it could get released to the public.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:12.900]   So here we go.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:17.420]   Now the next chapter of this incredible story is in comes the master builder.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:22.580]   So back in the day, back in the 80s, Bob had an associate, his name was Rob Torlidge.
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:26.960]   And Rob Torlidge eventually put together a company called Soda Instruments where he's
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:32.660]   the president and he's been the president since 1996, till today and luckily Rob is still
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.980]   alive and with us.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.180]   And so here's a picture of Rob as a really young man back in the 80s when he was doing
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.980]   lectures with Bob.
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:46.540]   And so Dr. Beck and Rob Torlidge got together and said, hey, he wanted him to take his product
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:51.700]   or take his discovery, you know, he had taken the brain tuner and took it up another notch
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:55.740]   and he put together all of the things that he had learned through his 10 years of clinical
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.780]   trials and experimentation and tinkering.
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:04.220]   And he put together a device that he now calls the brain, the bio tuner.
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:10.380]   And he had Rob, you know, take it and commercialize the product and actually make the product.
[00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:15.660]   And so for the last 10 years or more, I think I bought mine probably, I don't know, 10,
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:21.420]   15, maybe years ago, you know, there's now been multiple different models.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:25.860]   It's up to like version nine now that Rob sells on his website.
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:30.940]   But the idea here now is that the product was eventually commercialized.
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:38.940]   It's called the Soda Bio Tuner and this is a device made off of Dr. Beck's specifications
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.100]   and all of his different work that he's done.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:45.960]   And you can go on this website or you can go to, you know, to YouTube and you can actually
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.620]   see here's the how to use the bio tuner.
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.940]   And so I kind of just wanted to give you a vision, you know, visual of what it looks
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:52.940]   like.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.940]   So that's what it looks like.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:57.660]   And that's the probes that you put on, the little clamps go on your ear.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:02.620]   And so, and so with this discovery now commercialized and it's been commercialized for over a decade
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:06.820]   now, it, you know, it's, it's available to the public.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:11.320]   And so if for people that are interested, if you, you know, this is what's amazing about
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.320]   it.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.740]   If you have an addiction problem or you know someone who does and you can't afford the
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:21.820]   treatments going to, you know, doctors and so forth, here's another alternative.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.380]   And so, you know, it's not medical advice, okay.
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:29.940]   And then just if you take a look at the manual for the bio tuner, it has six different modes.
[00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:34.260]   And so you still have to do a little bit of tinkering, but you'll find out that the different
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:39.460]   modes tie into the different pulse widths or two different pulse widths, some technical
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:45.020]   jargon in there, but there's six, six different modes on how it's either continuously, you
[00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:49.820]   know, freak, you know, pumping the frequency through your brain, or it's pulsating it,
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:50.820]   so forth.
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.340]   And it's also, you know, there's one setting for the 7.83 Hertz.
[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:58.700]   If you want to tinker around with that frequency in your mind, you know, going through your
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:02.540]   brain, there's other ones that are just flat out the 111 Hertz.
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:08.660]   If you just want to focus in on addiction, but the idea here is that it's now been commercialized
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.060]   and it's been commercialized for several years.
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.780]   And it's now available to the public.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:16.660]   So the end of the story has not yet been written.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:20.300]   And that's what I kind of want to stipulate here at the end of my video is that we still
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:26.620]   haven't figured out, you know, I mean, you know, the cure, is it a cure?
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.940]   And I would say even though the Bob didn't mention it himself, I want to go back to what
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:31.740]   Dr. Patterson said.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:36.780]   And as it relates to addiction, you know, that it's most effective, right?
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:42.700]   Using these types of tools is most effective when backed up by counseling, remedial training,
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.020]   and a supportive home environment.
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.740]   But the idea though, is that it's available and it's available to you.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.020]   You don't have to, you know, spend a ton of money.
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.100]   This device sells for $275.
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.940]   It's available on SODA's website, link below.
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.820]   It's also available on eBay at $22.75.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.980]   I did check Amazon and Amazon.
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:07.300]   I don't know who sell it on Amazon, but they're asking $366 for it.
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.860]   So I don't recommend that, you know, don't spend more than you have to if you're interested
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:13.020]   in obtaining the device.
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:17.220]   But you can definitely get it for $275 on eBay.
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:21.660]   Link below in the description if you're interested also from SODA and just heads up.
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:26.740]   SODA, in order to actually commercialize this product, Rob Tortlage had to, you know, he
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:32.180]   lives in Canada and he actually makes it, and produces it in Canada because, you know,
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.860]   the FDA won't allow it to be produced in the United States.
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:39.260]   Now there are other people out there in the world that actually produce something that
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.620]   they call the brain tuner.
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:47.700]   And you know, whether or not it's to Dr. Beck's specific specifications is unknown.
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:52.020]   However, just to be heads up, that not all devices are made the same.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:58.460]   And if you're interested in getting one that's an exact replica of Dr. Beck's specifications,
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.860]   then you definitely want to go to the SODA instruments route.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:05.660]   Now, in terms of Dr. Patterson's black box, my personal recommendation and my personal
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:10.700]   choice was to go with the Dr. Beck version of it because it was such a much, it was such
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:16.500]   a better evolution of the technology in treating, you know, in treating your brain or tuning
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.500]   your brain.
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:23.300]   So, you know, also one last reminder, it's not just for addiction, it's for depression,
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:27.660]   it's for helping you with your memory, it's for anxiety.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:35.100]   And so, you know, the end of the story here is that the brain is an incredible work of
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:39.380]   art that we all carry around in our skulls.
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:49.580]   And the reality, and this is a fact, that if you basically tune your brain to different
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:55.260]   frequencies and, you know, and plus all the different variables that comes with the electronics
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:39:01.500]   of sending frequency, if you find that right frequency, your brain can do unbelievable
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:07.980]   things and to actually reverse a lot of the situations that maybe are preventing you from
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.180]   having total wellness.
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.460]   So, you know, there's, there's that idea here.
[00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:20.700]   So I just wanted to share with you the story of Dr. Margaret Patterson and the black box,
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:26.500]   how Dr. Beck made it even better and how Rob Torlidge brought it to market.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.300]   And I just want to say thank you very much for watching my video.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.220]   I hope you enjoyed this story.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:35.580]   It is a fascinating story in the world of bio-electrical magnetics.
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.900]   And I think that it can help a lot of people out there who have those kinds of issues.
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:45.060]   So now, if you've enjoyed this type of content, this is what I do.
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:51.180]   My passion is health and healing in the bio-electrical magnetic space and quantum healing and all
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:57.340]   sorts of different areas that are not, that are not chemicals and nothing to do with big
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.660]   pharma.
