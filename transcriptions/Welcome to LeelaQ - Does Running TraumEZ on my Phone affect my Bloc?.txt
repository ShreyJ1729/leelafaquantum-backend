[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560]   Aloha, everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.560]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.080]   And this video is another installment in the video series.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.760]   Welcome to Layla Q or otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech and Quantum
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.480]   Upgrade. This is where we pluck out questions from our telegram chat groups.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.920]   And either I'll answer them or I'll ask Philip Von Holshendorf, the owner
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.840]   operator of Layla Quantum Tech to get his take on what the answer is.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.880]   And so this video is on the question.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.240]   Does my phone running trom EZ affect my block, meaning it, you know,
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.680]   it emanates energy, right?
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.840]   And if you're using it as a timer for copying and whatever and charging and
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.760]   you set it next to your block, is that going to interfere with the copying
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.040]   charging process? So here, let's listen to what Philip's take is on that question.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.480]   Now, the next one here is the, the question was, is that running trom EZ
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.640]   while using a block for copying and charging stuff?
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.120]   We got, I got asked that question and I, and my guess was, well,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.000]   we tell people to keep your blocks six feet apart and the block is emanating
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.160]   quantum energy. So my guess was, well, your trom EZ phone, you know,
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.600]   phone is emanating quantum energy.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.240]   So you should kind of keep it away from your block while you're using the block
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.080]   for copying and charging. And then people came back to me and said, but yeah,
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.560]   I'm using, but I'm using my phone as the timer.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.320]   And it's right, it's right there on the table next to the block.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.480]   So, so the question is, is does, does having like quantum upgrade or trom EZ
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.600]   running on my phone, is that, is that going to interfere with me using my block
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.160]   if I'm doing it all right in front of me? What are your, what are your thoughts?
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.320]   I know you probably haven't tested it, but what do you want to know?
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.640]   I have a clear answer to that. It's a great question and it's, it's,
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.360]   it's no problem to have the phone sitting relatively closed because it is not a
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.160]   block. It's, it works differently. It is fine to do that.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.920]   I still like your approach to keep it a little further away.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.080]   But it's, you know, there's, there's no harm if you have it a little closer either.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.800]   Okay. Well, that's good to know because I'm one of those people that I use my phone
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.400]   as my three minute timer. And the phone is literally like a foot away.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.800]   And I never, I ever thought about it. And so someone brought it up and I'm like,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.280]   Oh, yeah, that's a good point. Okay. So per fill up, it's not an issue.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.680]   But if you, if you want to keep it away.
