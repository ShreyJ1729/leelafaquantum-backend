[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another video by me calmer and in this video I
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.120]   would like to share with you a passion of mine and that is the study of bio
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.040]   electrical magnetic devices and what they can do for your health and your
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.680]   well-being. I'll call this my electro healing series and this is the
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.480]   introduction to just kind of walk through at a very high level the various
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.720]   devices that are on the mark of the day and their classifications and some of
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.200]   the benefits that you can get from them instead of let's say going to a doctor
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.320]   and getting chemicals so of course anytime you talk about anything that's
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.560]   not going to the doctor and getting chemicals you're gonna want to have a
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.120]   bunch of disclaimers so if you don't mind why don't you hit pause read this to
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.160]   your heart's content I'll give you three seconds and then I will then jump off
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.800]   this screen and jump into the material ready one two three alright so welcome
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.720]   and welcome to bio electrical magnetic devices and what do I mean by that is
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.880]   that you know actually in the allopathic medicine world which is the the world
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.720]   most people are used to thinking when they hear the word medicine or health
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.200]   care and that's in our current environment today it's usually the
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.280]   hospitals the doctors and and that entire environment right there and then as you
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.920]   know there's what those people have called the other folks that provide
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.760]   healing and well-being types of services they call them the alt medicine home
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.320]   apathy bio electrics and so forth chiropractors fall in that
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.680]   herbologist fall in that but this specific area that has been my passion
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.960]   for close to 20 years is the idea of how can electrical and magnetics affect the
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.000]   human body and and there's reasons why and there's a lot of science behind that
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.600]   and I'm not going to get into that because this is high level but the idea
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.480]   is that it is it is actually quite sound there's a lot of science it goes back
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.960]   well over a hundred years in terms of using bio-electro magnetic devices for
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.840]   the healing arts and actually you know if you go into a allopathic type of
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.120]   facility as a hospital you will find an MRI machine you will find x-ray machines
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.760]   you will find devices in there that are electrical base that are used in
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.900]   healthcare for allopaths and then you will also find them in chiropractic
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.440]   offices and so forth you'll even find them veterinarians using them as well
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.280]   and so it's not a new thing for doctors to use electrical devices in the healing
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.720]   arts but it's but it's also something that if you take it beyond the hospitals
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.320]   you know it's considered alt so there's this real gray fuzzy line between the
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.520]   two concepts of when is something alt and when is something mainstream so but
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.820]   the idea though is that there are numerous devices out on the market today
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.360]   that do just as many devices do just as many different things some of them work
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.120]   some of them don't like I said I've been sort of been doing stuff like this and
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.360]   researching this and for well over 20 years and and it's I just have
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.840]   accumulated a lot of different devices and spent a lot of time testing them and
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.520]   trying them myself so but you know on this slide just this slide alone you'll
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.420]   find something as simple as this type of unit right here which is called a tens
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.780]   transdermal electrical neural stimulator and that's actually prescribed by
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.000]   doctors in today's world where they'll prescribe that for pain management then
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.920]   you get all the way up into these types of devices which are used to primarily
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.720]   in the chiropractic world and in the professional horse racing world they're
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.720]   used to help animals just basically prepare for and recover from strenuous
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.440]   you know physical exertion and so forth so there's lots of different devices
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.920]   this is right here as a senior device and that's developed by the Russians that
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.240]   use for a lot of different things up to including you know curing you know
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.000]   types of diseases so you know like I said there's a lot of different devices a
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.120]   lot of different things that they do and this video is just going to be an
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.720]   introduction to the three main classifications of bio electromagnetic
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.360]   devices just sharing with what I know okay so the three basic types are your
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.480]   your basics type which is your static magnetic field devices and that's
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.880]   basically what they call you know they're just magnetic fields but they're in
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.720]   the term bio magnets in terms of how do you use a magnet to to treat or or to
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.440]   you know use use it for solving problems and and that's something that
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.320]   essentially that means magnetic field that is not powered there's no
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.600]   electricity going through it it just it's the field itself that's produced by
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.320]   magnet and the other two types of bio electrical magnetic devices are powered
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.120]   up they're they're using electricity but one is called a resonant electromagnetic
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.800]   field device and another one's called the pulse electromagnetic field device and
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.400]   we'll get more deeper into that but those are the basic three one is sort of a
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.640]   subtle way of affecting the body and the cells which is just a static field and
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.160]   then the other ones are actually powered up and and energized fields so let's get
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.280]   talking about the very first one which I've covered this in a video when I was
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.520]   talking about when I did a C60 video stirs versus sonicate stirs are magnetic
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.440]   stirs that laboratories use to stir fluids and and of course they're
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.640]   magnetic stirs they use magnetic bars and magnetic fields to whip the bar
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.560]   around and so I covered a little bit of that in this in that video and I just
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.560]   want to just touch on it at a very high level this is an introduction but
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.400]   usually the the concept of bio magnets you know there's a Dr. Albert Roy Davis
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.040]   is the the founder the father of this type of science he was the first
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.320]   individual to kind of really buck up against mainstream academia science and
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.960]   saying look you know most scientists view a magnetic fields of a magnet they're
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.600]   you know obviously you've heard of North and South Pole you see that
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.280]   encompasses and things like that and this is how the mainstream science really
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.840]   kind of looked at magnetic fields this is way back in the day everything's in
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.360]   black and whites you can imagine how old it is but then what Dr. Davis kind of
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.120]   came along and spent 30 years of his life trying to prove his theories with
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.720]   that experimentation published everything that he had done wrote several books and
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.680]   then along came scientists behind him that have validated his theory and what
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.880]   his theory was was that you know that that magnetic fields are not circular
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.920]   from one field to the other that he coined the phrase there's a block wall in
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.800]   between the two different fields and that North Pole energy is actually
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.480]   separate as opposed to like this it's an actual separate field in the South Pole
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.520]   field and that they're actually separated in the middle and that that
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.920]   there would be a different level or different type of energy coming off the
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.960]   North Pole field then would be the South Pole field and he did 30 years or
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.680]   more spent his entire life studying the difference of when he exposed things to
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.320]   just North Pole energy or just South Pole energy and then of course observing
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.600]   the results and writing numerous books on the subject on now what his the
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.840]   outcome of his work and the scientists that followed that validated some of
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.160]   his findings have produced a plethora of different bio magnet devices that you
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.640]   could find on the planet on in on the market today I'm sorry and some of those
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.840]   could be as simple as just using a magnet and applying a different field to
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.880]   what you are trying to treat or affect you know different magnets and get
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.760]   rare earth magnets you can use you know iron magnets and things like that but in
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.960]   the veterinary world you'll see magnetic blankets such as this they also make
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.560]   them for the hooves and for the and for the feet you know to basically treat
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.160]   soreness and I think it's a laminitis and things like that in horses and so and
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.400]   then it's a quite popular product and it's validated by the popularity of its use
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.200]   and you'll find that in barns all across the country in terms of you know when
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.880]   a horse is a vigorous workout to put a magnetic blanket on it and it helps
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.680]   actually help the horse recover from the physical exertion you'll find people
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.720]   selling magnetic mattress covers such as this or or seats that you can sit on
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.520]   there's bracelets and braces and headbands and all sorts of different wraps
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.600]   where people have incorporated magnets into certain types of devices or you
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.840]   know wraps and things like that where you can just you know have a way where you
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.760]   can apply a specific pole of energy towards whatever is ailing you and that
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.960]   that that could actually help you feel better and and treat your your injury
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.840]   whether there'd be a sprain or just a sore muscle now when you actually look
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:29.520]   at I took this section of of of results from Dr. Davis's book from the magnetic
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.920]   blueprint of life page 41 if you want to look it up and basically this is kind of
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:41.480]   just gives you a real high level of review of how magnets is specific energy from
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.880]   the different north or south pole energy will affect different aspects and this
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.160]   is through all of his research and you know you can kind of read for yourself
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.560]   and I just want to point out some some of the things that really stand out is in
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.480]   the area of pain which is which is the point I made earlier with the horses that
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.520]   you know a north pole energy actually can help relieve pain it can also enhance
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.040]   healing you know and it's not uncommon to find the ability to actually use
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.760]   north pole energy on a magnet placed over a wound and actually speeds up the
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:14.400]   healing for it it relieves allergic disorders it actually helps you know
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.760]   improve performance and so forth so that's kind of one of the reasons why you
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.120]   know putting that blanket on a horse prior to a race or something like that
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.760]   is actually beneficial so the north pole energy throughout Dr. Davis's
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.880]   experiments for all of his years actually implied and proved through his studies
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:35.440]   that north pole energy of a magnet is very very positive for living organisms
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.300]   and then what he also found out with that south pole did the exact opposite as
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.840]   you can you know you can you can imagine right it's the opposite of north and so
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:48.040]   he did if you read his books it's quite amazing where he he did tests on on
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.000]   chickens he did tests on plants he did tests on all sorts of different things
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.440]   to see what was the difference and it was just amazing especially the one where
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.800]   he did it on on baby chicks where you know the chicks that were raised in a
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.440]   negative field their eggs were you know basically sitting in a negative north
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.840]   pole energy field during their incubation and when they hatched versus a south pole
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.200]   and how the different two groups of chickens behaved was just amazing the
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:19.840]   north pole were calm and and you know basically calm normal and and and good
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.200]   good birds the south pole ones were aggressive and the opposite it's just
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.560]   and he did lots of experiments like that a really fascinating stuff but he did
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.560]   kind of prove that a magnetic field will have an effect on on you as a living
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.560]   being and it can either have a positive negative one depending on what the
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.960]   polarity of the field is so that is the first type of bio electromagnetic type of
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.640]   device and these are the subtle energy ones using magnets and so it's very
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.880]   interesting stuff a lot more we can go into this at a later date now I want to
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.680]   talk about the next one which are your resonant electromagnetic field devices
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.880]   you know what I mean by resonant I mean a frequency that is broadcast like you
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.720]   would like a radio station or a cell phone tower but it's basically pumping
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.560]   out a frequency at a consistent rate and it just goes on and on and on and
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.520]   and so the the founder or the father of resonant frequency devices as a healing
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.920]   you know modality was a gentleman by the name of Dr. Royal Raymond Reif for
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.400]   anyone who's ever even put their toe in the pool when it comes to bioelectrical
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.400]   magnetic devices you would have heard this guy's name he is the founder he's
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:32.240]   the father of the science and what he's it you know over time this is like back
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:37.000]   in the early 30s and 40s 1900s but you know in today's environment everybody
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.320]   thinks that he invented the frequency generator which is completely wrong
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.520]   what Dr. Royal Raymond Reif did was he invented the first microscope so he could
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.160]   see viruses he could see you know bacterium and he could see you before
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.040]   that you couldn't need to have anything that you could look at them and because
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.880]   he invented this microscope yet an engineering friend put together an
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.280]   analog frequency generator here's a picture of the first one and then what he
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.440]   did was he would just basically broadcast with this frequency generator
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.080]   why he was looking through his microscope that he invented he would look at
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.680]   different viruses and basically spent his he also did 30 to 40 years of his
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:17.040]   life looking at what would happen when specific frequencies or basically
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.560]   broadcast at a picture dish with different viruses and he identified over 40
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.320]   different different viruses whether it be like mumps rubella measles all these
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:33.120]   kinds of viruses at the time that were plaguing the country and he found you
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.200]   know with just incredible amounts of trial and error the exact frequency that
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:43.120]   would actually just that would that would basically destroy the cell walls of
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:49.160]   whatever viruses that he was attempting to try to you know basically kill and
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.200]   then he would basically notate that frequency and he called those them
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:58.600]   mortal oscillatory rate or more MOR frequency for very specific types of
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.920]   ailments and then what you could do at that point once you identified what the
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.760]   more was for a specific condition let's say rubella at the time then a patient
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.440]   could come in with rubella he would basically sit him in a chair put a big
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.520]   antenna next to them and play that frequency through their body it would
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:18.600]   destroy the rubella viruses inside that patient and that's how we would cure
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:24.120]   them and so he basically was the father of this concept of broadcasting
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:29.240]   frequency through living organisms to find to you know and and specific
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.720]   frequencies for specific ailments and can you imagine this has been over a
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.080]   hundred years now since he started that and more and more and more frequencies
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.840]   have been found since then and so the whole idea behind the concept of these
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:46.280]   devices and it kind of comes down to this simple phrase hummers versus ringers
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.640]   and in this world we're talking about hummers frequencies that just are
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.080]   broadcasted and remain steady and the concept is is it's easier to see a
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.240]   picture of it than actually try to you know verbally explain it but you'll look
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.640]   at you know these are four different wave forms of a frequency that can
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.120]   come out and the idea is that you know the frequencies broadcast and it either
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.920]   is a sine wave or a square wave and so forth but the idea is that the distance
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.720]   between the peaks or the valleys of a waveform determines its frequency and
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.280]   of course you got your power your frequency and you know of and then the
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.160]   different form of the wave and based on any one of those three criteria and you
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.840]   can imagine how hard it was to go through you know literally thousands and
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.400]   thousands different combinations for him to find those very specific frequencies
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.240]   I could do specific things and he did that and then a lot of people a lot of
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.080]   other incredible scientists have picked up his work since the like the 1930s and
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.480]   40s and have carried on his work and so today's world you know there are lots
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.080]   of different examples of resonant electromagnetic field devices that
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:53.320]   produce a frequency and so you'll get everything from devices like this you
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.400]   know it's just you know there's so many devices out there and I can actually get
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:02.440]   a lot more detailed about individual ones I actually own all of these types of
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.240]   devices at one time or another but you know you can use like anything from
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.760]   like this one here's a multi wave oscillator this one's a frequency
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.960]   generator from spooky this is a GB 4000 that's a bullet electrifier this is a
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.400]   soda light one and so forth but all of these different devices produce a
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.320]   frequency and that frequency and or you could choose a frequency and or you
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.240]   can run a set of frequencies and those frequencies when applied to living
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:33.320]   organisms whether it's your a petri dish your dog cat you plants you name it and
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.400]   depending on the frequency power and the waveform you'll be able to achieve
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.040]   various results so and this is and that's what you would call resonant okay
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.840]   hummers devices at hum now the other type now what okay sorry let me what what
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:52.400]   they do a little bit more explanation here is the effects of a resonant
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.200]   frequency device it primarily the most important thing is that it induces
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.840]   electrical operation now electrical operation is a very very important
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:06.800]   aspect of electromagnetic field devices and because what that does is it just
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:12.320]   try to take the analogy of a ping pong ball and a golf ball now a ping pong ball
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:17.120]   represents your cell or any cell plant cell your cell blood cell whatever and
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.160]   it's a cell and its cell has a a cell wall plants have cell membranes right so
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.800]   I'm sorry the other way around plants have cell walls and people have cell
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.600]   membranes but they're they're solid all the way around and then what happens is
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:35.680]   when a frequency of or a basically a current of electricity passes through a
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:41.760]   living organism cell okay it'll basically puff out like a golf ball so it looks
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.840]   like a ping pong ball electricity passes through at our frequency right which is
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.560]   basically a burst of electrons and all of a sudden the cell will pop up like a
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.000]   golf ball where there's just nothing but divots all around it okay so the wall or
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.480]   the membrane now has all these little divots in it and what the divots are is
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.400]   just a thinning of the wall or the thinning of the membrane and where it gets
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.640]   thin it enables anything else in the bloodstream or anything else in the
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:13.520]   lymphatic fluid around the cell to get into the cell easier okay now that's a
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.900]   good thing if you've got in combination with you have let's say
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.280]   total silver in your in your bloodstream at the time or you've got ozone water or
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.840]   I'm gonna say ozone in your in your system where it induces it you can put
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:30.280]   oxygen into the cell or you've got any other types of medicines herbs essential
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.540]   oils any of those kinds of molecules floating around in your including C60
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.660]   floating around in your body and you electropyrate then you're you can
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:43.560]   actually absorb more your cells can pop up like the golf ball and through those
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:49.340]   thinning of the membranes can absorb more of those nutrients or substances into
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:54.940]   the cell actual into the cell itself and and by doing so just to give you an
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:59.500]   example if you take vitamin C for example it's water it's water-soluble so
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:04.300]   if you take any amount of vitamin C you're only gonna absorb maybe 19 or 20
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.380]   percent of it and the rest of it just gets flushed out through your urinary
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.820]   tract okay but if you take vitamin C and then you electropyrate you increase
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:17.240]   the amount of vitamin C you're able to absorb by around 10 a factor of 10 one
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.560]   of the most important things that everybody warns you about when you're
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.240]   taking when you're doing any kind of electroporation either through resonant
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:28.040]   or pulse electromagnetic frequencies is you know do not take in chemicals or
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.680]   alcohol or anything that would be bad if you took more of it you know like you
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.640]   wouldn't want to drink a beer electropyrate and then if you have like
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:40.560]   basically a 10x effect from the alcohol in the beer well I'm sure some of you
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.760]   would like that but but you know the idea though is that huge warnings don't be
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.200]   drinking while you're doing that and that kind of thing you know if you're
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.520]   gonna take a towel and I'll take you a little bit of a towel and I'll not your
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.880]   regular dose because once you zap you're gonna get a 10 times a you know
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.940]   basically absorption rate because of the act of electroporation so it's very
[00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:04.600]   very very important and and but it's also this incredible effect that nothing
[00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.280]   else will do for you and then that's what you know basically bio electrical
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:14.520]   magnetics do to living organisms and then also too it's anti pathogenic I mean
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:20.040]   there are numerous pathogens that absolutely cannot handle or survive a
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.120]   zap through you know whether it's pulsed or just a frequency they just
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.920]   don't exist of course rife prove that through the more frequencies but you know
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.160]   it's it will kill off it will basically eliminate pathogens and that's other
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.320]   living in organisms in your body that aren't you you know like fungus is
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.440]   viruses bacteriums and and molds you know those things are you know they're
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.800]   constantly in our bloodstreams we pick them up everywhere breathing them in
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.640]   daily and you know if you wanted to detox from pathogens you know doing
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.920]   something like blood electrification or just you know using one of these
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.560]   devices will be very beneficial towards helping you detox out pathogens it also
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.240]   and then of course you know causes detoxification if you're basically
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.920]   killing off pathogens you are detoxing and another major warning when using
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:12.000]   these devices is watch out for the herskire a herxmire you know symptoms
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.560]   where you know you detox too fast you do too much too fast you will have detox
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.600]   symptoms because your body's not able to process out all of let's say the the
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.320]   stunned and/or dead organisms in you your body needs to flush them out right
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.400]   and if you do too much too fast you have more you have more toxins floating
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.360]   around in you and dead pathogens then your body's able to flush out of you and
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:38.280]   you will have basically a detox reaction which is the opposite of what you were
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.200]   trying to do to begin with and so we get more into that later too as well and
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.280]   then of course there's cellular entrainment now it's cellular entrainment
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.640]   entrainment in just general is the idea of living organisms having their own
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.560]   frequency and their own resonating frequency and and that's something that
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.400]   is been measured that I think like you know if you look at the human body and
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:03.520]   you look at human cells I think they resonate around 50 milliamps and
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.720]   different cells of different frequencies as you know again proven by rife and so
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.560]   let's say if you had a diseased or damaged set of cells in your body and
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.720]   they're not resonating at the normal frequency let's say that I'll just
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:22.320]   throw out a number that it's 20 you know like whatever 20 units are but it's you
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.720]   know it's like it's normal is 20 as an example and it's running around 15 you
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.800]   know it's damaged or something well if you play just like tuning forks if you
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.480]   take one fork and it's and you don't do anything with it and just leave it
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.360]   holding your hand take a different fork in your other hand and bang it and then
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:43.120]   hold it next to the first fork the first fork will start resonating at the same
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.600]   frequency as the one that's ringing and that's called entrainment and you will
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.880]   basically do that with your cells so one of the ideas of resonant frequency
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.400]   treatment is to play a frequency that's the normal healthy frequency for
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.520]   whatever cells that you're trying to treat and it'll basically through
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:03.760]   cellular entrainment get those other damaged cells to start ringing at the
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.520]   same healthy frequency and it helps your body heal itself and that's the
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.400]   concept of cellular entrainment so this is how do you kind of figure out if
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.400]   you've got which one you're buying you know sometimes it is very confusing for
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.440]   people aren't used to this but these are some steps here that if you want to
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.680]   know like am I buying a resonant frequency device or you know how do I
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.920]   tell the difference between pulse and resonant but the thing that you'll listen
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.680]   for is the keywords here like right frequencies or no geo frequencies or the
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:33.040]   types of the other set of frequencies out there for devices that you can buy
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.280]   now the other thing the third the third type of device that I'd mentioned
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.760]   earlier you've got your hummers which I just described and you've got ringers
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:47.080]   now your ringers are a frequency but it's also at a very very high-powered
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.120]   frequency I mean that well it could be very high-powered but it's much higher
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:55.640]   power than a normal hummer hummers are just broadcast that is at the same level
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:02.400]   of power x number of watts of output but a ringer is a pulsed electromagnetic
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.440]   field and so it's an actual pulse so if you've ever heard of the concept of
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:11.160]   EMP you know electromagnetic pulse so this is exactly what that is and this
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:16.120]   is a PEMF pulse electromagnetic field device and what it is it's just a
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:20.600]   broadcast frequency at a very high power where it just pops up and then it just
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.680]   rings like a bell and it just bing and then it just kind of you know you know
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:28.760]   basically you know it gets lower and lower and then it rings again and so
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.560]   these are pulsing pulsing devices as opposed to just you know just straight
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:38.840]   forward humming your ringers have a very similar effect as the hummers but
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.680]   because of that first initial pulse of electricity you know big pop they
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:48.160]   actually have there are some different effects from those devices because of
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.560]   the way that the waveform has been structured and those devices come out
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.120]   and you'll see these more like in your chiropractic offices but you'll see
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.440]   these pulse electromagnetic where they're pulsing not humming but ringing and
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.440]   these are the kind of devices you'll see in your chiropractic office you'll
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.000]   see these if you go to Barnes you know it's very very popular in the horse
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.880]   industry especially in the race industry today I mean this is actually a one
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.960]   that's made for horses and when you're and you're basically toting it around
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.520]   the barn in the most recent Kentucky Derby I mean 16 horses I think 22 or
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.520]   something we're treated with PMF before and after the race you know it is a
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.880]   very legitimate science there's a lot of a lot of studies backing it is an
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.640]   accepted practice right now and so this is one of the things that it's used for
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.720]   these are very expensive devices so just like one of these is easily 12,000
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:43.200]   it's it's not a cheap device to own but it has an incredible effect on on
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.280]   basically I'll get actually let me just get to the next slide I'll tell you what
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.560]   the effects are but that's what these devices do you can get a small one for
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:54.960]   the home get one for the barn get one for the car practice offices they come in
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.880]   pads that you can lay on and and exercise on and so forth and that's what
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.320]   these are these are pollsters okay now the effects of pollsters as I was
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.440]   getting into is it stimulates the lymphatic system and it increases
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:11.200]   oxygen to the cells so that very that pulse of energy is so important because
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.780]   it's not just a constant hum but it's a ring it's a pop and then it just you
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:19.520]   know pitters out and that ring and that first bolt of energy actually opens up
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.360]   the blood cells it decouples your red blood cells from each other increases
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:26.400]   the surface area of all your red blood cells because they're not coupled
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.200]   together like little you know rolls of coins and that allows your red blood
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:35.080]   cells to you know basically absorb more oxygen into your body your your it moves
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:39.360]   your fluids around so if you are a horse or you're a human and you've had a very
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.880]   strenuous workout or you pulled a muscle or something like that getting a PEMF
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:48.400]   treatment right will open up all your cells it'll open up your blood cells
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.080]   it'll move fluids around and it'll help you recover so much faster I've done
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.960]   this so many times and it is a fantastic you know methodology to actually help
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:03.200]   reduce pain and recover from exertion of course it also reduces inflammation
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.360]   that's part of the whole lymphatic system and it reduces pain because of
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.560]   that ability and again you know the PEMF also does electroporation as the
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:16.480]   resident ones do it also causes detoxification and it's also anti pathogenic
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.560]   and that's what's one of the magic things about about these devices in this
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.920]   modality in terms of treating and curing and helping is that they have
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.160]   really really incredible benefits that most people don't you know they don't
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.920]   consider that most people are pill poppers and you know pill popping comes
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.000]   with a lot of side effects and one of the things I will tell you about all of
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.760]   this there's only one real side effect and that one real side effect is
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.360]   detoxification and that if you do too much too fast you're gonna you're gonna
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.960]   have a detox symptoms which will usually is like flu-like symptoms or
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.160]   rashes and things like that but you know there's never gonna be where you have
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.160]   such a you know you have a you know like this you're gonna not you're not
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.880]   gonna get a three-page list of things you don't worry about and three percent
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.320]   of the people who try to die kind of thing that this doesn't happen with
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:09.840]   this this type of modality so it is very safe and it is very effective and so I
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:13.640]   and I do highly recommend trying any one of these three and then the main thing
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.840]   now is is what's the difference okay so I want to make sure I go back over the
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:22.040]   difference and it comes down to this it's so simple okay can you feel it if you
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.880]   can feel it you know you can feel that but you know that pulse it's that's
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.480]   quite simple then it's gonna be a it's gonna be a ringer if you can't feel it
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.400]   then it's gonna be a hummer okay so if it's something like this you don't feel
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.360]   a thing it's just a frequency passing through your body that's a hummer but if
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.720]   you feel a pulse and you're actually feeling this boom boom boom you know
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:46.280]   then it's then it's definitely a ringer it's gonna be a PMF type of device so
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:50.240]   that's my introduction to bioelectrical magnetic devices I hope you've learned
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:55.600]   something you found it interesting this is my passion I've been I I don't know
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.440]   why I just find it so interesting and I've been studying it for a very long time
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.920]   and I've spent way more than money than I needed to on all these different
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.840]   devices but I'd be more than happy to share them with you as we walk through
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.800]   each one of those types of devices one by one and what I've done with them and
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.680]   how well they work and so forth so happy to share as always thank you for
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:19.280]   watching I really appreciate your time I know you're busy so thank you and aloha
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.360]   Have a great day!
