[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host Kay Elmer and this
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.800]   video is another installment in the video series. Welcome to Lele Q, otherwise known as Lele Quantum
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.240]   Tech and Quantum Upgrade. This video in particular is a discussion with Philip and I about
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.480]   high EMF environments, because that seems to be the topic of the days everyone has a concern about
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.800]   EMF. So what I did was, you know, I asked Philip specifically about what about, you know, like we
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.200]   all are subjected to normal EMF, right? Cell phones, Wi-Fi, normal. But then there are environments
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.000]   where people live in and or expose themselves where they are in incredibly higher levels of EMF and
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.120]   what is the response or what would Philip recommend for that and things like living next to a cell
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.720]   phone tower, being inside of an electric vehicle and that sort of thing. So here's his take on that
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:58.160]   subject and I'll play the clip now. What I wanted to ask you was, you know, in the idea of really
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.360]   high levels of EMF, people that are really living close to, you know, cell phone towers,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.360]   people that are sitting inside, you know, EVs and electric vehicles and just really being irradiated.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.680]   You know, there's all these different different levels of EMF and you literally could really be
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.640]   maxing out. And so that was the question I've got is that, you know, and somebody actually asked
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.440]   this yesterday about, and they were saying, you know, if I just were a capsule or I subscribed
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.400]   to quantum upgrade, you know, am I 100% protected from EMF? And my answer was no,
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.840]   because it really depends on the severity. And that's why there's different options for people,
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.560]   right? There's, you know, the traditional EMF mitigation has always been avoidance and then
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.040]   shielding. And then now because of Leila quantum tech, we've got this third option
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.600]   to mitigate EMF is through our actual biology, which is what, you know, the quantum energy does.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.600]   So I'd like to just get your take on, on how Leila works with really high EMF environments
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.680]   and how does somebody kind of just like, how would you just add on like, you know, where would you
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.760]   start? And then if you live in a higher EMF environment, what would you do next? And then,
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.120]   you know, and if you still have effects, you know, and you're still having problems, what would you
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.440]   do after that? So, you know, what do you recommend?
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:23.200]   Yeah. So let's take an example of an electric car. And in an electric car, it's been proven,
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:34.400]   and that was the strongest electric car currently on the market, that any of the blocks and also
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:43.760]   the quantum upgrade can neutralize 100% of the negative effects of all the electromagnetic
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.640]   frequencies in an electric car. And they can do that pretty much instantly,
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.280]   which is fantastic. So from that standpoint, there's really nothing else you need to do.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.360]   The only open question is that we didn't cover during that specific study is,
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:16.240]   is the heel capsule enough, also, you know, in such a high-power electric car. And that's
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:27.200]   something I just don't know. If you don't have an electric car, then you may just not want to get
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.240]   one, even though you can protect yourself. That's just some general perspective on it, as long as we
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:42.000]   can. I'm speaking for me personally now, as long as I can, I will not buy an electric car.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   So if I lived under a 5G tower, let's say it that way, I live somewhere and
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.480]   I'm not so attached to it that I could move away if someone put a 5G tower right next to it,
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:06.560]   I would probably move away just because of the look of it. And if I was very sensitive to
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.200]   energies in general, I would also move away. Even though I can harmonize these energies,
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.160]   it's still always a lot of energy. So if that makes sense, it's not necessarily negative,
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.200]   but it's just a lot of constant energetic buzz that goes above and beyond just
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.160]   having some blocks at home, that's totally positive, right? But if you add a 5G tower,
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:42.880]   this is an overwhelming amount of energy. And if you're a very sensitive person to EMFs,
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.440]   you will still feel that. So those are the scenarios. And in all other scenarios, literally,
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:59.360]   you really don't need to worry about it. It's just then just maybe worry about your own mind
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.680]   and not thinking yourself into still having a problem where there is none.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.120]   You agree that avoid if you can, because why make it worse?
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.000]   But having, with the quantum upgrade and the electric vehicle,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.800]   that's a great example. There's a study on that that shows that it's 100% effective.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.040]   And being inside a little metal box sitting on top of a giant battery is probably about as
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.040]   strong as anyone can exist. So that's great.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.520]   And there's something more to add maybe in terms of shielding now that you also bring that up again.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:43.200]   So I personally wouldn't just shield. If I shield and I actually use our underwear
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:53.040]   constantly, right? But it has, for me, it has way more effects than just the shielding, right?
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:01.280]   That's a nice add-on to just protect that part of the body. And by the way, we're going to relaunch
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.800]   the quantum jacket and it's going to be awesome. It's going to be freaking awesome.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.880]   It's probably the one, the most exciting product in the pipeline right now,
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.960]   because it's going to be really nice in all aspects.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.240]   Anyway, that one, for example, if I fly on an international plane or somewhere else,
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.000]   usually they put it on pretty cold. So I don't like to be in super cold environments then.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.520]   And especially in these planes, there's always this weird airflow.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:42.160]   And also, there's a benzene gas exposure that's ridiculous plus the EMF exposure.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.120]   The benzene gas, by the way, you know, I'm mentioning that there has been a study in 2022
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:55.440]   with about 200 flights and they showed benzene levels in these planes through the freaking rules.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:05.200]   Okay, so this is a fact and it is not good for the human body. Anyway, so with having that jacket,
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:13.040]   that jacket will, and like all of our clothing in the future, will carry also the heel 360
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.640]   frequency, which is phenomenal on its own, but we added the benzene neutralizer.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.480]   That will take care of EMF, will take care of the benzene, and it will just take care of
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:35.840]   providing you just amazing energy. And this is something I would personally do on a regular basis
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.880]   and also recommend to others. You know, it's just so nice to sit in a bubble.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:47.440]   And if you have an electric car ready and you wear jacket anyway, then we're one of those.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:53.120]   Maybe in addition, have your, your underwear or something like that. I think those are the
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.320]   situations where this comes in handy. But again, it doesn't just block EMF, it does a whole lot more.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.080]   So okay, yeah, so this one I was thinking, and I just wanted to kind of get your take on that.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.480]   Thank you very much for that. And I think that's the good thing everybody to remember is, you know,
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.400]   eight, if you can avoid it, do it. If you, if you can't have your, you know,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.040]   helping your biology with quantum tools, and if it's really severe, then, you know,
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.680]   next level up is shielding. So that's a really great recommendation. Thanks for that.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.520]   Well, that's the clip. And thank you very much for listening to the, to the video.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.840]   I do want to add one last thing is that, you know, the idea behind severity,
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.120]   you know, being to avoid, you know, it's, it's almost been, it's almost impossible. Now,
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.720]   if you understand the Starlink satellite system, I mean, the entire planet now in the last five
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.000]   years is completely enveloped now by satellites, you know, where all the population centers are.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.520]   And so even if you, you know, let's say, you know, like turn your Wi-Fi off at night, if you,
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.680]   let's just, you know, look on your phone, every one of your neighbors as Wi-Fi going, you know,
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.840]   so it really doesn't do much. And then if you're outside, you know, you might think you're avoiding
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.240]   it, even if you move to the country, but because of all those satellites beaming down 5G,
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.800]   we just can't avoid it anymore. So I think that this is one of the most important things
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.000]   of our generation is to really understand EMF, really take the precautions. And so, you know,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.640]   the quantum tools are fantastic for that. And just as a reminder, you know, if you don't know how high
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:26.000]   of an EMF environment you're living in, then, you know, there's all these different EMF meters you
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.960]   could buy so that you can then measure. And so you can really know for sure, you know,
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:36.560]   where in your home, where in your life, you are exposed to higher levels of EMF so that you can
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.520]   deploy some of these ideas, you know, in terms of, you know, just having like a baseline of quantum
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.800]   energy around you so that you're, you're kind of mitigating that EMF. But then if you, you know,
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:52.000]   not kick it up a few notches by being in a super high environment, like being inside of a data
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.920]   center, as for example, near power stations under power lines, you know, near airports in an airplane,
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:03.040]   it's there's so many different places where the EMF just gets, you know, goes through the roof,
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.360]   then you would want to then think about doing the shielding aspect as well. So if you do go to the
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:13.040]   website, you know, link in the descriptions below, not only does, you know, Leila Q provide and quantum
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.520]   upgrade provide that EMF protection through quantum energy. But also there's on the, on the device
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:26.320]   site, Leila Q dot com, there's, you know, the EMF protective clothing, it's special clothing
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:33.360]   with metal fibers in there that holds that energy. And there, then also blocks its shields of physical
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.000]   shield of the EMF. So there's sweaters, I'm not sorry, that's sweaters, there's going to be a
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.600]   jacket that's coming out. There's already one that was that's been out for a while, but there's
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:47.200]   going to be a new one, as Philip mentioned, also T shirts and underwear. And I do know that Philip's
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.000]   working on a product for female EMF underwear as well. You definitely want to protect your
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.480]   reproductive organ. So yeah, so keep that in mind that, you know, there's a big difference between
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:02.240]   just every day, you know, EMF and, you know, environments that will really, really spike up.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.080]   So there you go. So thank you very much for watching the video. Vila and Donk to our German
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:11.680]   friends. And I really appreciate your guys time watching these things and learning along with you.

[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.280]   definitely subscribe. And I am continually posting more and more information on how you
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.560]   could use your Leila quantum tech tools and how to use upgrade to benefit your life. So
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.960]   other than that, hey, have a great day and Allah.
