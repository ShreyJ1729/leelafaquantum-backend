[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   all right and welcome to another ticker's academy video on today we're doing a Leila
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.720]   quantum tech product question and answers session with philip run over and doors philip i'm sorry
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.440]   just i messed that up philip some more von holtzendorf
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.080]   awesome three times fast you know i'm sure everyone just kind of butches your name and i'm sorry
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.920]   but how you do it you know everybody i just want to warn you that we do this in one shot so
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:37.360]   there's no there's no re-editing or so but anyway we're doing a product uh leila quantum tech product
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.840]   questions and answers and i got philip on the line good morning philip happy friday okay all right
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.400]   to you too yeah and philip is the founder of leila q uh he's also one of the healers of the
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:58.720]   leila q network he's also a healer himself and a shaman and uh former it executive and is just
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.960]   amazing background uh your last uh video i think those i was watching uh i think it was the one
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.600]   with the bio hacker guy that's on your own way youtube channel is is yeah it's just kind of
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.160]   interesting how you know people were talking about your background and how you came from that
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.160]   background i think it was with the lady from soul frequency i'm sure i've listened to two
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.560]   oh yeah so there's two new uh interviews this week and you were talking to the lady from soul
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.480]   frequency and it was just real if for anyone that wants to have the background on philip that that
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.320]   one soul frequency interview which is on the on my site on my blog uh and also posted in the chat
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.920]   group but you know it's just a really good story about how you came from realism you know realizing
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.040]   the same thing with me right how do how do people like ourselves who who basically are you know
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.960]   typical you know normie right i guess normies the best way and then one day you just know it's not
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.960]   right and this is not the way life should be and then you just kind of click and and then we all
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.760]   become uh our own healers and then some of us branch out and be other you know healers to help others
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.520]   so that's a great story so anyone um i'll post a link to if anyone wants to hear that uh podcast
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.280]   anyway um video description below so anyway good morning philip thanks for joining me um i think
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.880]   uh a lot of our members find these product uh questions and answers sessions really helpful and
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.360]   so what i do is uh i'll jump into the chat and let everybody know that uh we're doing a a Q&A
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.200]   and then i just gathered a whole bunch of questions off of the chat and so we're going to be going
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.000]   through those today all right so before i start though i just want to do the disclaimer because i
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.920]   don't know what we're going to be talking about so i want to just be real cautious here so the

[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:07.680]   for listening to that and so let's jump right in and so here's my my list uh of all of the questions
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.960]   i pulled from the chat uh i think it was about a week ago and i had to stop because you know we
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.680]   will only have so much time and so i did grab as many as i could uh with that i thought would fill
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.600]   up the hour um and then let's go ahead and just kind of jump right in so one of the first things
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.760]   that popped up phillip was uh you know obviously last week you you you launched the travel block
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.680]   and then along with that came a whole bunch of questions about well now that there's a third
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.160]   block you know because we did the tutorial on the quantum and the infinity and at the time we were
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.240]   talking about the travel so there's now a third block out there and it's very different uh than
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:50.640]   the other two and not not in extreme ways but it has its own attributes so i thought when the first
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.320]   things we could kind of do is kind of like level set and and share with everybody what what the
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.680]   actual differences are uh and i'm just going to be and by the way everybody we do this unscripted
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.880]   so i'm just going to be pinging phillip's brain and everything he knows and try to write it down
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.680]   so and then share the deck um and then if there's anything that you know phill doesn't know right
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.800]   away um then i'm just going to pencil it out and try to cover it later all right so uh bear with us
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.840]   this is all live so the first thing i did was you know we're getting questions about obviously the
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.440]   basics right what's the size of these um of these blocks and so one of the things was i measured
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.000]   out the size of the quantum infinity and then the travel block i believe right it's four by four
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.840]   bite and then it's six inches high is that correct because i don't have one yet i have the prototype
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.640]   that's a great question it's possibly correct or probably correct if you got it from somewhere
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.720]   or from all our website okay yeah i i don't i don't know exactly either well i took it off of just
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.520]   what that one picture of of crew holding it because she could fit her whole hand in there and mine
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.800]   is like four by four by four and i can't fit my you know barely so okay so i'm thinking it's about
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.440]   six inches so for those of you that are wondering uh how big it is and then i'll i'll tidy this up
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.720]   and publish it but that's about how big it is everybody it's pretty small um and so then the field
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.800]   strength we with a field the size of the quantum field that the that the block generates uh for
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.920]   the quantum block it's about 130 feet or about 40 meters uh the cal uh the infinity block uh
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.160]   right out of the gate this is only about this is just like you bought it and you just got it this
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.840]   is before you upgrade or do anything with it but it's just out of the out of the box um the infinity
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.000]   block the quantum size of the field the field is one kilometer and then the travel block in the
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.920]   last video you mentioned it was about a hundred meters is that about right i just want to make
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:52.640]   sure that okay so that's correct okay you're 100 to meters with uh the 150 was actually pretty
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:59.600]   stable but the 100 is is fine to say because that's a fairly strong field and emf neutralization
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.160]   should happen and and at minimum 50 percent of that which would be a radius of you know call it 50
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:12.880]   meters um and 100 meters is a great uh great guideline there okay so yeah and then that's okay
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.800]   so that's a statement out of the um tutorial so for those of you guys who haven't seen the tutorial
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:26.480]   yet because you're new um the the field is literally uh it's kind of like it's it's a round field
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.760]   right so it's it's it's in every direction right it's a 360 degree field and then is that correct
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.400]   fill up and then yes just correct me when if i'm wrong if i'm just going to and then the other
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:43.440]   thing too that what philip just said was that inside this field i'm just kind of doing it i'm
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:53.120]   just whiteboarding here uh uh inside this field okay um with inside the giant field so this is the
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.280]   size of the field that we're talking about here which is the 41 kilometer and 100 meters
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.160]   but then what and then philip correct me if i'm wrong but your emf testing of the blocks
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:09.280]   indicated that it was primarily most effective within the 50 percent right it was like one half
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:17.200]   of the field was where all of the emf um uh you know effect was concentrated is that correct
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:24.000]   yes that is correct because the the field gets weaker the further you get away from those blocks
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:31.920]   and yeah that's that's about the guideline and you know it can vary probably about 10 20
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:39.200]   percent depending on where you are what is the emf soup that you're exposed to so i i don't think
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:45.760]   it's it's 100 accurate in all situations but i think it's the best guideline we can give
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.520]   and that's what you can work with and frankly i don't think anybody
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:56.640]   needs to be concerned in any way because the fields are so so large that you know if
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:05.120]   just the quantum block on its own 40 meters is very big and if you have a 20 30 meters of
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:12.800]   radius i mean that definitely covers your whole home yeah oh yeah everything yeah yeah so and then
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:18.960]   also too really yeah you make a good point it's about and it also is about the amount of
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:25.360]   electro smog soup you're living in you know like i used to live in a condo building in Hawaii
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.480]   and there was a wife you know like basically to the cell phone tower on top of the building
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.120]   across the park from me you know literally we went two thousand feet away so yeah and then
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.840]   living in a building with all that wiring and all those neighbors you know yeah there's a ton of
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:46.240]   soup uh where i live now is in a home but i still pick up uh every neighbor's Wi-Fi with it probably
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.200]   hundred you know easily two three hundred feet i pick up so many other Wi-Fi routers when i you
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.520]   know when i go hook up so yeah it's amazing how much soup even though i'm living out here in the
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:02.240]   country in a neighborhood it's still a lot of Wi-Fi uh okay so that's kind of the description of fields
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.720]   and then so now the setup time so this is when you get it out of the box and you first assemble it
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.240]   so i just wanted some clarification is it 12 or 24 hours before the field is kind of like
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.120]   stabilized because it's not you know it's been you know disassembled for so long and then now
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.320]   you know somebody buys one they assemble it so what's that setup time for and is it different
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:29.440]   between the blocks yeah the assembly time is obviously little um i would call it one minute for
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:36.240]   the travel block and this the actual setup time to wait it's it's actually less i would say it's
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:43.360]   it's not even more than two to three hours okay and we had given the guidance of 12 to 24 hours
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:49.120]   so that's really our bad but we always want to be more conservative and in the beginning
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:56.720]   we saw these still develop um and it may actually still develop over like a 12 hour period but but
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:02.960]   you're pretty much good after two three hours because then you have you start to have very very
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:10.720]   tiny changes okay and and it will have already a power that is that is almost at the 100 percent
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:17.360]   okay and is that the same for the q on the quantum and the affinity block two yes it's okay okay great
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:25.120]   so that's good to know um and then so now once you and so this is going to be uh okay so let's say
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:30.320]   you separate the plates and uh you know travel block let's talk about that in a second so i separate
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.120]   the quantum block plates or i separate the infinity block plates right because i want to
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:41.680]   charge a bigger object right like a bottle end to end um once i take the plates apart and then i
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.320]   kind of hold them so that they're in alignment again without rods okay you take the rods off
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.040]   but you still got two plates and they still need to be in alignment how long do i need to have it
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:59.680]   in alignment before i go to charge something if you had set it up beforehand um and did you for
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:07.520]   those several hours and or even multiple days etc or longer then it's basically a minute or so
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:16.640]   so okay it's it's it's very quick and and and so and so we've only talked about the first two blocks
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:24.320]   but i'm assuming you can separate the travel block as well right you could do oh yeah you can you
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:30.720]   can set that one apart as well okay we haven't tested for how far but i wouldn't be surprised
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:36.800]   i mean you could probably like a human can lay in between the plates um you can do that if you
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:42.960]   wanted to okay all right so that's okay so that's okay so that that brings up a question and so like
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:49.920]   say um uh spacing between plates so let's i just want to i just thought to add that to the chart so
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.360]   the spacing between plates now we've you've mentioned the past the quantum block is that you could
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.920]   separate like if you were to separate the plates what would you recommend be the farthest distance
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:07.440]   um that the plates are from each other let's say if you want to charge you know um a car motorcycle
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.320]   whatever uh or you know like a refrigerator so what would that distance be then for the quantum
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:19.840]   block i would say four meters and now we're just talking meters which is uh uh not good for
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:28.880]   the american so let's see yeah probably about 12 feet okay and the infinity block yeah you know
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:38.000]   let's say um four or five meters minimum i actually wouldn't be surprised if it still works fine with
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.800]   seven or eight meters but we just never tested that far so let's just stick with a conservative and
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:52.240]   um five meters there are also not so many objects that are larger than four five meters so i think
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:58.080]   everyone will be fine with that okay and then the travel block any idea how far apart those little
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:06.000]   plates could get yeah i would say you know um definitely seven feet eight feet should be no problem
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.040]   whatsoever and likely more i just don't want to you know say anything that that yeah i want to
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.120]   be conservative okay so three meters would be about nine feet would that be safe or we just
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:23.440]   should take two yeah yeah no i think okay all right so then okay so then um we've also uh discussed
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.480]   quite in depth uh on on our discussions as well as interviews you've made with other folks about
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:34.320]   uh the hawkins scale of consciousness and so and people have really dialed into that and so i was
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:40.080]   wondering if if you kind of like had an idea of you know out of the box what what the level of
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.360]   consciousness is in relation to that scale for each one of the blocks any idea on on those
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:51.760]   yes so on the hawkins scale we have the quantum block at five seventy one
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:59.520]   okay and it may be more by now to be honest because we don't talk about that much but
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.400]   we at least get the question does the energy ever get less and no it doesn't and actually
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:13.200]   the field gets more concentrated over time by usage um which we really don't talk much about but
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:19.680]   so the five seventy one is like the minimum you have uh with the quantum block okay and then how
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:26.080]   about you can write that in okay infinity block the basic infinity block seven hundred and thirty
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:37.280]   three okay and we have the travel block at uh somewhere between seven hundred and seven hundred
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:44.240]   and thirty three i would just call it seven hundred okay perfect um okay great and then for
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:50.800]   those of you who are um not familiar i'm just popping this up this is the the scale right here
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:58.720]   and so it's it's off um whoops i love those ads okay well that's not going to work out
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:06.240]   i tell you anyway so it's the hawkins scale of consciousness i think this might be a better one
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:13.520]   and it's the book is called the book is called uh for how i was this force power versus force
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:20.320]   and it's uh written like what 20 30 years ago where someone uh the author went through an
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:27.520]   incredible amount of effort to identify um human states of being and then relate those into levels
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.480]   of consciousness whereas you know the very bottom would be like you know the most negative you could
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:38.080]   be all the way up to full consciousness where and then and then so this is real interesting uh it's
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:43.840]   a great book this is the scale and this is what we're referring to so well now the next question
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:51.520]   that we got that that that ties to this idea of consciousness um was we had uh questions coming in
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:59.280]   from the group about a comment that uh Emma had made in the um in the chat and it basically was
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.880]   like you know it's someone asked how soon can i upgrade my uh infinity block and in the description
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:10.640]   and uh and the answer to that question uh she made a comment here that says we have so far upgraded to
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:18.320]   ib6 which i like the most so far also ib4 was and is fantastic each block has a slightly different
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.680]   character energy focus which was which was really fascinating to learn that you know these
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.960]   the blocks change as you upgrade them and there's so many people who bought the ib package that are
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:35.600]   doing that and so the question was was like well do you know yet and have you had the time to kind
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.120]   of understand what that character energy focus is because here it states that the ib4
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:47.520]   was the most healer of them all and the ib6 vibrates with a lot of unconditional love
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:53.120]   and you would consider that to be the most loving so i kind of put this little chart together
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.680]   to kind of just let's if we if we can and you have the you know if it's in your head right now
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:03.920]   but like what would you say as you upgrade from ib1 which is now remember now this is all ib1
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:09.280]   quantum you know this is all ib1 but once you get into ib2 all the way up to you know i just
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:15.280]   ran out of space on the screen but like do you have any anything to share that we could kind of help
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:22.160]   people understand you know as you increase the as you upgrade your ib back and forth what the
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.880]   higher you know what is that consciousness level growing to if we could fill this chart out if as
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:33.200]   much as possible and then what's the character of that of that upgrade you know that of that state of
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.240]   being so let's just start with the ib2 do you have any did you know you know i know this is a
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.520]   tough question i'm just i'm throwing this at you like first thing in the morning and hope
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.880]   unprepared remember this is live everybody
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:53.920]   so no i i feel prepared but i i don't have the answers to most of these so i can fill in the
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:05.600]   blank for so ib4 would be a 942 on the hock and scale okay ib7 is 1,152 and we actually do have a
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:15.600]   so that's that that message by emma is is old in that sense so it's not current anymore
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:21.760]   and we actually had that one at the biohacking congress in Las Vegas and it literally
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:29.600]   it literally harmonized the whole hotel so that congress was actually at a quite disturbing energy
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:35.120]   hotel with a casino and it is just terrible and then a lot of people actually came to us
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.080]   from like oh my god since you walked in with this thing here suddenly this energy has cleared up
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:46.720]   and so it's a super powerful one so 1,152 yeah everyone that's familiar
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:55.680]   top of the edge it's above it's above this field measures wow okay so okay we'll talk about that
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:01.040]   in a second i got questions now uh okay so what else what else do you know off the top of your
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.120]   head that like you know because that way if we always have something in your people can kind of
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:13.040]   gauge but so what is there anything else you know that would fill in yeah so ib5 i remember that one
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:21.120]   being so that had a it's hard to describe the character of it but it almost was like a
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:31.280]   such a high frequency in a way that you know if you can envision a frequency that breaks glass
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.880]   it's so high and it breaks glass and on an energetic level that's how it felt it was
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:48.080]   not really very discomforting or so but it went to places that i felt like i was like triggering
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:55.360]   stuff and bringing stuff up so it was discomforting in in a way but it was very comforting too because
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:07.520]   it it was following with a lot of relief so um it's very hard to to find a word to describe this
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:15.680]   character to be honest but it it it really was working on different levels um and and so
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:23.680]   these characters by the way those i would describe as the predominant aspect that shows because
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:32.240]   they're pretty complete and in all they do and certainly the healer aspect you find in all of
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:38.640]   the infinity blocks right but the number four was just as if that was like just his main task and
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:46.000]   everything else was secondary to the primary task and and so on so that's the same with the ib6
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:54.560]   but i don't have anything i could i could tell about the characters for all the other ones with
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:01.680]   ib2 and ib3 we didn't really look at that and i can only describe ib5 and ib7 i would have a
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:09.760]   hard time as well to find just a special thing about it okay no no problem at all i mean i think
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.040]   that you know each one of these takes a tremendous amount of time and effort uh to kind of identify
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:21.680]   so just to let everybody know i mean this is as much as we know um and it evolves over time as Philip
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:27.840]   said so um you know it's all about you know we're exploring new worlds here and but this is what
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:35.040]   we know so far so the idea though simply though is that each upgrade has its own it it all does
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:40.800]   you know the blocks continue to do what they do however they start to actually focus in on a
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:46.400]   character which i think is just amazing and then the consciousness levels as well so um i was
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:53.120]   wondering though you know like um uh if you could point out the issue here about upgrading too fast
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.240]   uh because that's the one thing i kind of warn people about because i upgraded too fast
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:06.160]   and um it was it was an interesting experience but so what would you say to people just like
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.960]   you know because i know you always tell people to take their time but then everyone keeps rushing
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.560]   into it so all right what are your words of wisdom here about you know like hey yeah this
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:23.200]   is really cool that they change uh and they get stronger uh but but so what's your but yeah so
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:29.440]   it's a wisdom from Philip first of all obviously it's different for everyone right because everyone
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.840]   is at a different state of consciousness at a different part in their life and has different
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:44.000]   experiences in regards to energy work quantum energy and so on so if someone is very experienced
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.480]   healer already i mean there's no point they need to wait forever to to upgrade to a level that they
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:58.240]   feel is matching their vibration um the most but if you've never dealt with it you need to be really
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:05.040]   cautious and probably be with the first generation for a much longer period of time that's why it's
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:12.640]   really hard to generalize we have said you know give it two to six month um in between each upgrade
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:20.080]   which is quite a range but that doesn't mean that there are exceptions to the rule right um but the
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:27.600]   important part is that it really isn't about stronger and faster and and and then that equals
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:38.480]   better no it it matters that what is the best level for you and and it's that is the only big
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:46.240]   question and our egos tend to always want to have the fastest the best and oh if i if i upgrade to
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:52.000]   eight then i'll evolve quicker and oh i'll be enlightened faster and that's not really how
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.480]   it works uh because it it can be overwhelming to the nervous system and it can be overwhelming
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:07.360]   from a detoxification perspective and it would just force you to go through um transformations
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:15.440]   quicker which can be a little bit unpleasant at times right when emotions come up in a faster
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:25.280]   and more frequent manner than it would usually do that so the the softer and nicer approach to
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:32.240]   ourselves really is to to check in okay is this so when i have an infinity block just check in at
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:40.960]   times okay do i feel that now it's time to upgrade and that is the that is the only voice you should
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:47.280]   listen to your inner voice your feeling not think it i should do that i should get you for now you
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:57.760]   know that i'll be good look we lost your audio there's nothing wrong and you don't even have to
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:02.800]   think oh was my feeling was my feeling wrong no if you feel if you have that impulse go do it
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:09.520]   yeah and and that's how you approach it because then you always have a vibration that um
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:17.040]   that has been very beneficial to you and so when you have an infinity block of the first generation
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:22.720]   as an example and you are with that for quite some time at some point you may wonder well
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:28.480]   did this lose energy did that the energy and the infinity block decrease so that's a good hint
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:36.000]   for you to tap you on the shoulders and say cool i feel literally upgraded consciousness wise and
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.400]   myself have upgraded because the infinity block does not lose any power it never decreases in power
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:48.080]   it's just that you are on a higher level than you were when you got started with that and then
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:52.960]   you could say cool let's upgrade to the next level where you again have this
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:26:01.520]   extra energetic support the extra challenge the um yeah the extra consciousness level on the
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:08.880]   hawken scale that you can tap into and be around with and learn from okay so that's how i would
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:15.840]   approach it yeah no that's really good has there and then you know there's i i'm asking a question
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.560]   here about what would happen though i mean is there has there been any situations where a
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:26.720]   customer upgraded so fast that you know they had to reach out to you and kind of like how do i
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.640]   you know because they're living with this incredibly high block unless they disassemble it there's
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:35.280]   really no way to get get away from it but they've done it too fast has there been any situations
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.960]   where you could kind of share with people that hey this was what could happen to you like
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:44.240]   you disconnect from the block or you know it's i mean is there anything like that out there that
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:50.480]   you want to share with yes so i i don't want to say names obviously because that there should
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:57.360]   remain anonymous but but there was uh uh one that actually was quite experienced and energy work and
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:08.720]   had you know yeah then many many many years of of training and just upgraded super super rapid work
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:19.680]   so uh he ended up with uh uh infinity block 12 and infinity block 13 after a ridiculously short
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:29.040]   time and we were already wondering well you know that maybe just way too quick and you know all we
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:35.680]   can say is you guys be careful and then you know he reached out at some point and yeah something was
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:45.440]   completely off and we realized that level first of all wasn't even ready for um well on earth that
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:52.160]   vibration was just too high and it was also way too high for him it was so high that his system
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:28:00.400]   basically blocked the block that makes sense so to point where it wasn't working anymore because
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:07.920]   it it was just too much so that was it's it put in the breaks if you will and then we worked with
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:14.560]   him and and and with the block and we got it over a few weeks to the point where um he could then
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:22.080]   actually be around the the IB12 and that was working fine and everything he started to be harmonious
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:28.880]   and flowing again everything started working it was really a process um so that was the one
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.800]   example because indeed you can't you know once it's at a level like that you can either disassemble
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:43.040]   it and wait and then work in a different way like we work with Roman on it um but you can't really
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:49.120]   get the the energy out anymore yeah so once it's there it's there yeah okay so yeah so just you know
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:53.920]   I just wanted to share that thanks for sharing the story I just you know was interested to find out
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:59.120]   you know if there actually is that you know a detriment it's like nothing bad but you know it's
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:04.080]   like you just aren't ready for it I think that's probably the the key here for everyone to take away
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:10.240]   is you know take your time follow your intuition um and and be aware that you know these blocks as
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:16.400]   a increase in consciousness and and strength um that you might not be ready for it and a personal
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:22.000]   experience real quick everybody is like I went from I got my infinity package last year in the
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.200]   spring and by summer I was up to eight and I was I wasn't the one that film story here but but it
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.080]   uh for me it's it was what happened was was you know it's like you're it takes a while for your
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:43.520]   own being to a to adjust and and so I basically I personally believe that I went too fast because
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.920]   all I could feel was like like you know like in Star Trek where the ship goes into warp and it
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.400]   just flies through space real fast and that's kind of what happened to my consciousness and it just
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:30:00.240]   went so fast so far uh and in such a short time that you know last at the end of the summer I had
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:07.920]   massive life-changing event that I instigated that I was not that you would ask me a year prior
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.680]   but you know that I would have done what I did I would have been like absolute you know that would
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.600]   have been incredulous like there's no way I would have done that but then this thing just propelled
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:22.080]   me forward and put me into a completely different state of being in every aspect of the way I
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:27.920]   think and I wasn't ready for it and it just kind of was like it was it was very it was intense
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:34.640]   experience and so I stopped at IBA and I only recently went to nine just now like like eight
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.440]   nine months later and then I'm stopping again I'm like okay this is this is it and then I'm adjusting
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:45.360]   to the nine um and it feels really powerful but comfortable but yeah I just really want to
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.000]   cautious people that you know take your time follow your intuition but thank you so much for
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.680]   that now the other thing about this so here's our questions I pulled from the chat
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:31:00.480]   we did talk about that block matrix okay then we talked about the question about the character
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.400]   so then here's the question that came out to which is upgrading out a sequence because
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:09.840]   we know you know people who are friends and they both buy one and then they help each other out
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:17.200]   right upgrading their IB's so but the question was is and it's come up more than once which is like
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:24.080]   oh I have I have a two and the other person has a four if I put my two inside the four does it become
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:29.440]   a five or what is it what happens to it so could you kind of chat you know how would you know what
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.680]   would you tell people about that kind of stuff where you're not going one two three four five but
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:42.720]   you're going out of sequence yep it's definitely possible so the prerequisite is that the infinity
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:50.720]   blocks need to be charged at minimum the first generation if that's the case
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:59.280]   then you could put it into let's say put the one into a three and it becomes a four
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:06.400]   or you put it in a four and it becomes a five that's indeed no problem do we recommend to skip
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:14.320]   levels no but it's it's still possible okay so you can do it and then it becomes the next one up okay
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:20.640]   does it change I mean I'm sure you probably haven't even researched it but my first question is
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:25.840]   does it change the does it does it actually become a full five even though it started out as a two
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:33.680]   like yes okay okay okay so it's possible but it's best to follow the sequence because the sequence
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:40.560]   is you adjusting to each level as they come over time if you jump ahead two or three levels
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:47.280]   you could have issues right yeah it's pretty much like if yeah if you if you work and learn
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:54.160]   for a math test in school and let's say you have four weeks to learn for it and you know each week
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:59.440]   you do a little bit well you could also all learn it on the last day but then probably you need to
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:04.960]   learn for 24 hours and just beat it in yourself to learn it all and that's
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:12.480]   you know maybe not the best analogy but it's just you know the the learning time and what you go
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:17.440]   through it will be just a little bit more condensed that way yeah I could it's like yeah I could
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:26.880]   imagine it's like skipping two grades in your ten years old alright okay so that's okay so that's
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:31.280]   that's that's the answer for that then you know after our video last week right there were so many
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:40.480]   people that went myself included put my name and my birthday into uh mike iby and um i'm still
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:46.560]   kind of trying to subtly understand what what that did uh and it's just it's it's something
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:51.040]   happened i just haven't been able to figure out what it is uh for me and i left it in there for 24
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:58.160]   hours so other people tried that and there's some feedback um but then one person put in
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:06.080]   their entire childhood uh astrology chart thing or something and um and the kind of was got a lot
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:12.400]   you know kind of like was kind of got a lot of energy out of that um i'm just wondering because
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.960]   i had asked you last week about well you know could you put in different dates but is you know so
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.320]   i'm thinking that you know by putting in the entire time frame of your youth and all of the
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.800]   different things that are happening all at that that period of time like there's you know thousands
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.520]   of issues that come up is that just too much i mean should people really just kind of like
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:37.360]   focus in on one date or one range date range and not try to do like your entire childhood at once
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:43.440]   kind of thing i mean what would you think what do you think about that yeah i would agree to focus
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:51.680]   on either a specific date or a specific time and then move on from there that's uh because you
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:57.680]   know life is long and there's a lot of a lot of things that we accumulate and i like to use this
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:04.560]   analogy of the backpack you know we're already born with with the backpack that has stuff in it you
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:12.640]   know you know could be from past lives where you know just certain aspects that we need to work
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:18.880]   through in this life and then you know we have our childhood as a little child at some point you
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:25.760]   know we may get hit by our father because we did something wrong or where we scream and laugh while
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:32.160]   we're out in the public and our parents tell us no stop it and you know those are all things that
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:39.360]   are little traumatized and they come into the backpack and make us more heavy and obviously
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:44.080]   then there's more right at some point you get older me you may have your first girlfriend and then
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:50.560]   she laughs at you and then walks away with another guy and leaves you alone that's the next trauma
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:58.640]   and you know there's tons of these things throughout our lives and yes we are on this path and everyone
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:05.200]   that becomes more aware of all this we're working on transforming these things right and to empty
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:13.920]   that backpack piece by piece that's pretty much what we do but to try to empty it all at the same
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:21.200]   time is impossible to do and shouldn't even be attempted so let's do one at a time or a few things
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:28.560]   at a time and one way to do it is to pick those dates another way to do it is you you know obviously
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:35.760]   the birthday I would only do that one with with a method we describe but then because you don't
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:43.440]   usually have a picture or video of your birth but then you start to have pictures as your baby or
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:49.920]   then you're two years old three years old ten years old and so on you can move take a picture of
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:56.320]   yourself you know while you're a year old for example and put that in the infinity block and
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:03.440]   let the energy work with that and then if you feel it's through then you move on to the next one
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:10.320]   and that's actually interesting a user of our technology and came up with this at some point
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.200]   because she had the impulse she's a she's a healer and she had this I mentioned that before
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:20.480]   a daughter that is has been super depressed all over life and nothing ever happened not even a
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:25.840]   former product nothing nothing happened and provided any relief so sometimes she had the impulse to do
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:33.760]   that a long story short it actually worked amazingly well and that's the way she had done it and I
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:39.120]   think it's a very smart way to do it start with childhood and then you know move on as you get
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:44.320]   older and so you could pick several dates probably we haven't really tested that but I wouldn't be
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:54.800]   surprised like if you know okay well on May 1st in 1999 there was a car accident I had and since
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:03.440]   then I've had I can't drive without fear you know as an example why not trying out putting that
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:09.360]   specific date in with your name and I wouldn't be surprised if it harvises that date as well
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:16.800]   oh okay that's really amazing so dates and then also pictures of yourself or whoever you're trying
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:22.800]   to help as children so and then you just chronologically go with different pictures representing
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:29.680]   different time frames of that person's life right and then it harmonizes each each each time period
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:36.240]   based on the photo of the of you as a child or or dates so that sounds all right so everybody go
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:42.880]   out there and tinker but that sounds really really encouraging thank you so the next question here
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:48.640]   is the we've got questions about the heal frequency for plants dogs and cats and the question stems
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.920]   from there's well there's right now temporarily there's no description on the website for these
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:59.520]   and but the description for the heal for us humans is you know primal human healing frequency
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:06.880]   so the question I guess is obviously you came out with the heal for three different other entities
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:12.800]   and is there like is that the do these heal frequencies for plants dogs and cats
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:22.000]   I'm guessing are customized for that specific species and it's kind of is it and is it the same
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:28.320]   as the primal healing frequency for a plant versus primal healing frequency for dogs you know is
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.160]   it is that is it actually a completely different frequency is the question
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:43.440]   yes it's a it's a completely different frequency there is a primal there's a primal healing frequency
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:49.840]   indeed also for dogs and cats and then there is there's one for plants and for the plants there's a
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:58.320]   specific birth frequency included as as well and these are all etheric though there's there's no
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:07.120]   molecular frequencies included so you can ting you know with with the plants for example and add
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:13.120]   something that you know is based on plant food for example so this is purely etheric and
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:23.600]   it's just the the best universal yeah support frequency for plants that we came up with because
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:29.040]   you could even go into details then then one for shrubs one for tomatoes and but then it gets
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:36.240]   too complicated so we we found a universal one and then for dogs and and cats specifically dogs
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:42.800]   and cats are very different so we we at first thought maybe we can do one for both together but
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:48.640]   that didn't work out so it had to be a separate one okay so that's that's key here so everybody
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:56.320]   just for clarification the heal frequency slash capsule for humans contains the primal
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:04.320]   human healing frequency plus the neutral base the nutritional bio base molecular frequency of
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:09.760]   supplements plus the healing the primal waters right and that so there's three sets of frequencies
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.320]   in that and that's what the heal capsule heal frequency is and then you're saying that
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:21.760]   go ahead go ahead oh and then you're saying that the heal frequency for plants dogs and cats
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:25.840]   don't have the i mean just want to clarify they do not have the water frequency they do not have
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:32.400]   a nutritional bio base but they're just etheric frequencies that you you know you work together
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:38.880]   with the human network to create that are prime you know that are specific to healing and an
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:44.240]   optimization you know for bio optimization for plants slash dogs slash cats is that correct?
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:52.960]   correct and the result is very very similar you could say that the dogs inner healer gets
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:42:00.000]   activated with that frequency or the cats inner healer gets activated and for the plants we can't
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.800]   really speak about inner healer for plants but it would be you know the optimal balance
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:15.360]   and and strength that gets supported okay if that makes sense no that's no yeah yeah that's
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:20.880]   perfect so okay so that's that's really good to know so for those of you who want to optimize
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:27.360]   your heal for dogs or heal for cats or plants feel free right to to create your own nutritional
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:35.120]   bio base list you know frequencies of of plant foods right or dog supplements or cat and you
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:41.120]   could add it to that to enhance it right as well as you know whatever else you want to add so but
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:46.320]   you're just it all it is is the etheric frequency but you can add more to it and kind of turn it into
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:51.840]   a booster okay no that's good good to know so that answers that question and now we're just
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:56.560]   going to jump into some questions and then for just 10 more minutes and then i want to get into the
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:01.040]   new product so i'm sorry if we don't get to all of them but i don't lose them so we'll hang on to
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:05.600]   these questions if we don't get to all of them there's quite a lot as you can see but i i feel
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:11.040]   up to us only have so much time every day and as you can see these these sessions fill up really
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.360]   quickly with content so thank you very much for submitting questions and we'll try to get to
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:20.320]   many as we can before we have to jump off and i want to talk about new products and services that
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.160]   are coming up that are important for people to know about so next question here i'm just going
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.720]   to go down the list a while back some were asking how important it is to have the mandellas facing
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:33.360]   upward when initially setting up the blocks and then reassembling them the eyeball plates
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:40.000]   does the order need to be the same and what are the effects if it's out of order right so
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.400]   mandellas always need to be facing in the same direction and can you mix and match plates you
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:49.200]   know top ones and bottom ones when you take them apart and put them back together does it matter
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:58.720]   it does not matter so you can put them together as you like and as they look and with the mandala
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:04.720]   same thing you know you can put them upside down it doesn't really matter for beauty we always
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:10.480]   recommend to have them facing up and that's how we always set up all blocks so that's what we
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.640]   recommend but if you don't want to see them you can put them upside down okay so if you take your
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:22.800]   six plates apart for your ib and put them back together it doesn't matter where they end up
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:26.480]   correct top or bottom correct okay all right so that's important that's that's very helpful
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:32.480]   actually it makes it easier next question is do clothes need a new charge in the eye block after
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:41.280]   each washing no okay do not okay so they just hang on to their charge okay um but you know but
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:47.760]   we've mentioned in some other discussion that stuff that's soft or electronics it's helpful to
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:53.600]   recharge every now and then do you still recommend just you know recharging like your cell phone and
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:45:00.320]   your clothes every now and then so it's not required it's just recommended right well i would do
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:06.160]   that with a phone and laptop and so on that's a different thing though than a t-shirt because
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:17.120]   there's there's constant electronic interaction and usually Wi-Fi emf you know interaction as
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:24.160]   well so there's it's very active in that sense and that you know for that reason we recommend
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:28.320]   an upcharge every now and then okay but clothes are good to go once you charge them you're good
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:34.080]   right yes but certainly if as you upgrade your infinity blocks feel free to at some point
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:40.640]   put them in and give them an additional charge i do i yeah i totally do that okay um okay now
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:48.080]   we'll come out with underwear for man by the way soon emf underway yeah i almost forgot that yeah
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:53.840]   okay on that we've been asked that that was that was asked in the group a few times and i was
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:46:01.040]   like okay we gotta do it at some point yeah and ask for 10 months okay good good to know uh okay so
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:07.680]   next question here is uh can we place a hand and a foil copied with frequencies of the inner piece
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:15.600]   or the heel frequency at the same time in a block so like put the frequency in the block and put my
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:24.400]   hand in there is the question right uh yeah i mean you you can definitely do that and the infinity
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:31.680]   block again i wouldn't then use the cards i would first make frequency foil so that you don't overcharge
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:38.880]   the the cards okay so it's it's definitely possible that you do that and you could also put a picture
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:45.760]   in and use the foil uh and put it in together if you feel you want to have that frequency
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.880]   another way to do it is just to have a frequency card in your pocket
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:56.560]   and put your hand and the infinity block at the same time so those are different ways
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:02.000]   on how to pretty much achieve the same result okay and then but there is a caution right about if
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.520]   you had metal in your body or you know if your teeth and if you put your head in a block uh you
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:12.400]   may not want to add a frequency because the frequency will be permanently embedded into your into that
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:17.760]   metal in your in your body correct right so if you don't want to you know if you want to be someone
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.320]   who could mix and match and try different frequencies you certainly don't want to make it permanent
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:29.360]   inside your body um so it's just you know so for parts of your body like if you have a rod in your
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:35.600]   leg or something just feel free to do this which is you know you can definitely put frequencies in
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:43.760]   with you pictures and and and body parts that don't have metal but if you put a metal into that block
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:48.560]   it's going to pick up that frequency forever and you know and it's not a bad thing but if you
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.880]   ever want to swap out and try something different just got to remember your mingling frequencies at
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:58.640]   that point because you're you're carrying that one forever in the metal um okay so next question
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:04.000]   i'd like to know if if this has been tested to see if the field of an IB is changed or busy
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.240]   slash occupied while there is a picture in it so does so you know like okay so that's a good question
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:14.480]   so if it's just related to the intention you have for it right so does it become
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:19.360]   focused on what you're trying to use it for and and and not so much doing the rest of the
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:24.800]   stuff it does like emf and harmonizing your your environment but now you've set an intention you
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:31.040]   put in a picture and is is all of the energy of the block going towards that that's a great question
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:39.040]   actually and the emf always is active so the and not just the emf the general harmonization
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:45.200]   energetic harmonization of rooms and areas that that's always active and is not at all
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:50.400]   impacted if you put your hands in there or if you put a picture in there and all of that so
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:57.680]   it it literally is multitasking and then at that point okay all right good uh next question is i'm
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:03.040]   wondering about putting my knee in the QB it has arthritis but doesn't matter if the knee is closed
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:08.800]   like i'm wearing pants i'm wearing jeans so do you have to be uh naked body parts or can you put
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.480]   closed body parts doesn't i mean closed body parts make a difference
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:24.640]   i would also a pretty good question so you i would i would if you have a you know you should put
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:31.360]   your foot in there i would do that without the sock but i mean it's also not necessarily a bad
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:36.000]   thing if you put the sock in there so the sock doesn't have like a frequency that's necessarily
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:42.720]   disturbing to you and you've been wearing it already and nothing gets like permanently
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:48.880]   imprinted anyway in your regular body so you don't need to worry about it that much
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:56.240]   but if you can if it's body parts where you can easily take off the t-shirt or take off the socks
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:03.040]   then then i would do that if not then it's not a big deal okay best to be naked okay um now can
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:08.640]   you guys give us a deeper dive into different ways to the heel capsule with time frames
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:12.560]   okay wait i'm not sure i'm gonna try to figure out what that means can you get a different
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:21.280]   oh i guess this is using the heel capsule to charge stuff um that could be a video all by itself
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:27.360]   yeah let's maybe skip that that's yeah let's take too long now but yeah you can definitely use the
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:32.000]   heel capsule there's already some tutorials on the Layla web youtube site but yeah we'll have
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   to figure that one out that's that's gonna be a longer one okay sorry um does this oh does any of
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.880]   this specifically help bringing of years like if somebody had does it to tonight is we don't know
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:48.720]   okay don't know we don't know um doesn't hurt those take your hand the blocks see what happens
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:56.240]   okay so okay so next question how multiple blocks are in the same room okay so how different
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:01.680]   the generations of blocks in the same room affect the kiwi field level range fall off or how
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:08.720]   close can they be together especially included travel block capsules kiwi objects so like yeah
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.640]   proximity if i already own a couple of blocks and i have a cute a heel capsule
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:18.800]   is does your i think you mentioned once was uh keeping everything about three feet apart
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:23.200]   was your standard but is there anything else people need to know are multiple things
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:30.000]   like two three meters apart uh blocks need to be two to three meters apart that would be you know
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:36.960]   six to nine feet six to nine feet apart for at minimum i'm a little bit more than six feet actually
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:45.840]   um okay i'm six feet and uh that's not quite two meters so more than six feet okay so best to keep
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:51.280]   all that stuff in different rooms uh so they don't uh affect each other uh but then if they're even
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:56.880]   if i got like three blocks in my house right it's like three overlapping fields no matter what right
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:01.680]   because there's the large of fields are so large and that doesn't affect any it doesn't affect the
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:07.200]   performance of any one of the blocks no not at all and actually mapping fields basically in the same
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:15.920]   space what it does is it it it optimizes further the the field at home so it increases the consciousness
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:22.720]   level on the hawkin scale in the home uh further because you have multiple of those
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:30.240]   um and so there's there's an increase and yeah but even if you're in a hotel room right you're
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:34.720]   traveling and you have a travel blog and you have an infinity block you could still have those in
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:40.800]   the same room it just just make sure there are those ideally three meters apart but two meters
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:46.080]   will be okay okay all right and then let me one last question before i jump into the new products
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:52.400]   discussion um and this comes up quite a bit you know uh and lately it seems this comes up all the
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:56.880]   time but it's like i'm interested in better understanding intentions and the ethics of
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:02.400]   using the blocks uh to help others obviously so put someone's picture in the block to help them
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:09.040]   is it okay if they are unaware right if they are unaware of the block or should i put
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:14.800]   someone's picture in there only with their permission so that's a good that comes up all the time so
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:20.320]   should people be asking or talking to the person they're trying to help and and having them
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:30.320]   participate in the healing process yes or no so no need to do that you can certainly if you want to
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:39.120]   but the difference between putting a picture in the block with neutral pure quantum energy
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:51.360]   is is very different from a healer trying to fix something with someone that that someone may not
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:54:01.840]   want to get fixed so if you put the picture into the block that person's soul has at all times
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:11.040]   the ability and possibility to reject that energy not leverage it in any way shape or form and
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:20.800]   so but if you start to intrude as a healer and and try to fix that someone or you work on some
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:28.240]   traumatized because you think that should be gone but that that soul doesn't really want it
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:34.560]   you can still do these things and that's real overreach and should never be done like
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:40.960]   i would never ever work on someone or with someone without that person's
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:51.200]   consent yeah now there are there can be nuances right so if you have someone that is in a coma
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:59.920]   you know my dad for example had been in the coma about a year ago and so what do you do then you
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:06.400]   can't ask you can't physically ask but you can still then as a healer connect with that person's
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:14.080]   consciousness or soul and and get an answer that way and then that's how healers would check in
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:19.920]   right in order okay that but putting someone in the block it's no problem okay no it's a really
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:24.400]   good description okay thank you for that all right so we're going to jump over to
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:29.600]   just before we cut off phil passed a leave in ten minutes and i didn't want to miss this
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:35.440]   and thanks everybody for submitting questions and next time we'll do a q&a again we'll ask for
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:39.600]   more and continue the list and try to bank through this i think this is really helpful
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:43.760]   we fill up you're such a busy guy that it's uh you know i know that you don't have a lot of time
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:49.120]   to jump in into the chat and answer all of these individually so you know thanks for taking some
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:54.960]   time today to do this um thank you for all the from all the members so now let's talk about new
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:58.880]   products and frequencies because i think this is another area that people are very interested in
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:03.040]   and so one of the things that uh we did cover in the last video i'll put a link in the description
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:08.960]   below that we did introduce the travel block the new kiwi bottles and the infinity of black screws
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:13.680]   but i wanted to just kind of touch on um what are the other new things that are coming up so we
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:18.560]   in there before we started the video we talked about some of the new frequencies so philip if you
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.600]   want to just kind of kind of go down the list here and kind of just mention
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:25.600]   well what you're working on and about when you think it'll be available
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:32.000]   of the frequencies because i know this is focus your mind when was when we talked about in the last
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:41.280]   video and that was focus i i hope that we'll have it available in the next three weeks okay then
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:48.400]   the same with the resurrection frequency that we haven't mentioned before this one just as a
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:57.360]   quick uh quick overview uh helps also with this backpack stuff that i that i mentioned
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:05.040]   initially so we have a lot of experiences and then we tend to act and live based on our experiences
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:12.720]   but not based on our actual essence of who we truly are so it helps over time it's obviously
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:18.000]   not a frequency card that that works right away like most of the cards you know you can really
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:26.080]   work with them over time and you can bring all of these experiences in order again if that makes
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:30.640]   sense so that not that it would neutralize an experience but it would the experience would
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:36.560]   still be there but it would be at its orderly place and wouldn't make us do things just because
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:42.000]   we've had that experience so that's a very interesting one that actually comes from crew
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.720]   that's one of her core competencies that actually when she works with people it's one of those things
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:52.480]   that she does um and is very experienced in that so then we have an inflammation
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:58:02.080]   uh card that that's yours so i'm going to introduce that real quick um and i think we will call it
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:09.440]   the inflammation relief booster if i'm not mistaken okay so how quickly can we get that done so
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:17.040]   ah unfortunately i'll have a lot of traveling coming up but let's let's commit to the next
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:22.800]   two to three month uh and then if we can get it earlier we'll do it earlier we're currently
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:29.280]   creating the mandala i've sent a note already right when we started talking and if you want to
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:35.360]   say something about that obviously feel free and then the calm for dogs pretty self-explaining um
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:42.400]   similar time frame hopefully we can get it quicker and yeah those were done by K and and
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:50.720]   he's done an amazing job with them uh and we had Roman look at these cards and there wasn't
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:57.520]   anything that needed to be done really so the calm for dogs was perfect and it was immediately
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:04.480]   tried on a couple dogs and it works and the inflammation relief yeah i don't know if you want
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:08.960]   to mention something about that one yeah actually you know i was thinking about doing a tutorial on
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:14.400]   how to make boosters for people that just are not sure um about you know like just sharing my
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:20.400]   approach to it but i'm i strictly just do um molecular frequencies and i and i basically
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:25.760]   go through a process of doing a ton of research finding all the different possible abilities of
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:31.520]   trying to provide a frequency but then the key is the harmonic right is is you know you just you
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:35.600]   know it's just not just like oh let's take the top 50 and it works so that doesn't happen very
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:40.080]   often but as you find that harmonic of all the different frequencies that have the same objective
[00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:45.520]   which is to help relieve inflammation so i actually had to get Roman i was like i think we were on
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:50.240]   like prototype five before Roman it was like yeah this is it right so i went through a lot of
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:54.400]   prototypes so i just you know so i'll be i'll be doing a video on how to make boosters um but yeah
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:59.600]   that's kind of what i did was i just did a lot of research went back and forth um trying to find
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:04.720]   that right harmonic that actually produced the effect that we wanted um and so that was that was
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:10.160]   an interesting uh go around the call for dogs i took a completely different approach because you
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:14.640]   know Trevor one of our newest members who's very active in the group and i love the guy he gave me
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:20.080]   the suggestion of like he's been actually doing dowsing trying to determine what the best uh you
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:24.880]   know frequencies are that when he makes a harmonic uh which i call frequency sets and so i started
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.160]   doing that for the first time i hadn't really thought of that before i don't know why i'm kind
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.000]   of kicking myself for not doing that and and so i actually started dowsing all these different
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.640]   things to help my own little dog because she freaks out whenever there's a thunderstorm
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:42.640]   or fireworks or whatever and so i just did that i dowsed uh to a whole bunch of different things
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.640]   until i found this right set and then i made the booster and and all you know and i didn't even
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:52.320]   have to go back and forth it was just it worked and now my little dog wears it and and so her response
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:57.440]   still she gets nervous gets you know scared uh when the thunderstorms come but nowhere near
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:01.520]   nowhere near the the reaction that she used to have when that would happen i mean it's it's still
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:06.400]   there i mean she still gets scared but she does not get like you know heart pumping you know
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:11.600]   panting and totally freaked out like she used to be so it's definitely helping her and so
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:17.840]   you got a dog with anxiety this might help you okay so um yeah and so yeah i just i make
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:24.800]   boosters that's what i do okay so um now let's talk about now we touched on this trauma support
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.640]   in the last video and i kind of walked away thinking it was going to be a frequency but
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.400]   you kind of clarified that it's more like a product and so this is coming up something
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.360]   uh because we had you know we have people inquire about you know trauma you know how do i use the
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:41.920]   block for trauma which i think we covered very well with using pictures and dates right that
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:47.360]   really helps with trauma but this specific one is is can you describe that and and when you think
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:56.080]   it'll come out yes i i think this will be you know three four months time frame and it's definitely
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:01.520]   not just a frequency it's much more comprehensive than that and but at the same time it'll be also
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:09.360]   extremely impactful um and uh so it's it's almost more like a product uh so it'll be
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:16.480]   probably in combination with an app um or on the website really with even some guided
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:24.880]   uh steps to take that everyone can take it anytime at home and more i can't even say because we're
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:32.960]   still developing the exact feature and product we already know that it works all of that has been
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:41.920]   tested works with each and every trauma but how we get it to the people is not possible just in a
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:49.520]   simple frequency card okay so something to help unpack your backpack or for some of us we have like
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:59.600]   a roller duffle bag and others have these large Louis Vuitton great okay okay so then uh you did
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:04.880]   tease us a couple of days ago with the new travel bag any idea when this travel bag's coming out
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:12.960]   it's a good question yeah definitely in the next two months okay and then it depends because i'll be
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:19.200]   at some point traveling quite a bit and depending on uh if we receive the inventory
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:26.400]   before i travel while i travel or after i travel so we'll see but um it's all in process it's all
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:32.480]   ordered it's unfortunately a huge minimum quantity uh that we had to do but we we want to have this
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:40.320]   product it's it's actually so nice i love it myself and i met Dave they've asked me two days
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:46.960]   ago and he was here in New Mexico and his assistant reached out to meet him and then they asked if
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:54.720]   i could upgrade his infinity block for him and then i gave it back to him with with this back with
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:01.120]   one of the prototypes and it's just so cool because it's so easy to carry it looks very beautiful and
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.520]   yeah it makes life easy so thanks to everyone that had these ideas about the backs because
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:12.720]   honestly i wouldn't have thought of that um and it's nice i can't wait to have them and
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:17.360]   make them available cool it's gonna come for the travel block as well or just a cue
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:23.360]   an infinity block not just for a quantum infinity block because the travel block itself is just
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:31.120]   so little it fits in most purses uh most backpacks fits nicely into the car and in many spots so
