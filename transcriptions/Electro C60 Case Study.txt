[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another video by me Cammer and in this video a
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:13.360]   very unique and unusual one by far of a case study involving myself and a very
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.240]   nasty spider bite and I thought you would find it interesting and in the
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.080]   spirit of my channel I just share what I learn I share what I do so I figured why
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.200]   not just share with you the last nine days of my life so let's jump in some
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.640]   disclaimers I really want to make sure very very very upfront here this video
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.680]   contains some very graphic photos of a wound that I had and have actually so if
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.080]   you're not used to seeing things like that then you know this is probably not
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.400]   the video for you there's there are open wounds and so forth so you know this is
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.300]   clearly a case study on a very serious spider bite so if you don't like that
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.800]   sort of thing you might want to just click away otherwise this material is
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.060]   for research purposes only this is absolutely not medical advice I am not a
[00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.760]   doctor I am not giving you medical advice in fact do not try this yourself I do
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.400]   not recommend anyone doing this yourself I am a experimenter I'd like to do
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.900]   research and this is what I do and so I but I do not recommend in any way
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.440]   shape or form for all of the right disclosure reasons and you know what
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.040]   I'm talking about but I'm telling you do not try this yourself none of the
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.020]   techniques used in this case study are approved by the FDA and if you experience
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:48.400]   a serious insect bite by all means seek medical help I am a very unusual person
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.640]   and I like to research and I like to test an experiment and the only person I
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.060]   can on do that with is myself so here in lies my my case study this case study
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.580]   is myself experienced an insect bite that turned into a very serious abscess and
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.940]   infection within 48 hours is accompanied by significant pain for the first few
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.900]   days followed by major itching the suspected cause is I believe I got bitten
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.220]   by a black widow spider I did not see the spider the reason I believe that is
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.160]   because I live in Hawaii there's only a couple of things that are venomous here
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.280]   in Hawaii and centipedes and pretty much black widow spiders there are other kinds
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.680]   of spiders there are lizards and all the sorts of things we don't have snakes
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.720]   or anything like that I've been in my life I've been stung by wasso and stung
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.920]   by bees I've been bitten we have we have little red ants in the whole bit we have
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.000]   carpenter ants red ants a little black ants and I've been bitten by all every
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.720]   single critter I've been living here for 30 years I've been bitten by everything
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.420]   except I have never ever before this week prep part last week experience what I
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.500]   experienced and I looked it up I researched it and in comparison to what I
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.460]   could see off of Google the the visuals are quite the same in the the symptoms
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.700]   and the reactions are very much similar except for one which I'll get into now
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.860]   the treatments that I used upon getting this bite from the spider was I I doubled
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.300]   up immediately doubled my daily dose of C 60 I usually take a tablespoon a day I
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.020]   doubled it to two tablespoons a day immediately I implemented the Bob Beck
[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.500]   protocol which I've talked about in my electro healing videos which is blood
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.940]   electrification combined with collodal silver and ozonated water I also I'd
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.580]   also did a localized blood electrification using 10 pads and then I also was for
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.420]   the first few days I was using a topical oregano oil topically along with a
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:01.060]   topical C 60 coconut oil and then once I had an open wound excuse me I'm sorry I
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.740]   began doing ozone cupping along with that so I want to kind of give you a
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.340]   visual depiction of what had happened to me and this was a Friday ago I took my
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.020]   dogs out to a park and I was sitting out there and I had gotten an insect bite and
[00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:22.740]   that evening the bite was like this small and it was itchy and irritating and it
[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.620]   hurt a little and I was thinking it was just really weird I had it I had you know
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.980]   I thought it was maybe a mosquito bite but I didn't quite know what to make of
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.900]   it and then the very next morning well actually within I would say 36 hours or
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.980]   24 to 36 hours the bite had gotten this large and then there was a circle around
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.900]   the bite where it was just really dark in the middle and it was light pink and
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.980]   then there was this really weird circle and it looked like that and it was really
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.420]   weird and I immediately just went into overdrive the within 24 hours 36 hours
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.340]   I immediately knew that I definitely not had it was not a mosquito bite and I
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.660]   had to take a serious action to address the situation because it was definitely
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.300]   not something I'd ever experienced before but I knew that it was toxic and it was
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.660]   bad so the issues that I was dealing with in my mind that I had to figure out
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.060]   what to deal with and I just want to caveat that I'm not really a person that
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.660]   runs the ER for every boo boo so I you know I look at something like this and I
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.900]   have all these modalities by which I can implement and I just you know I
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.500]   primarily just go to myself to treat whatever problems happen so I knew that
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.180]   there was some kind of a toxin in me it was it was immediately infected it was
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.780]   infected almost immediately which was very unusual for me and then I initially
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.260]   was a closed and then it became an open wound what one of the concerns that I
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.220]   had with using a bio electrical magnetic devices on this wound was the
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.500]   proximity to to my heart I'd actually attempted to use a senior but it was too
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.780]   close to my heart and I just I decided to just abandon that immediately and then
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.340]   in terms of the pain it was it was very very painful and the itching once the
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.500]   pain subsided a little after a few days the itching has just been unbelievable
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.660]   so the modalities or the treatments that I'd implemented I want to give you
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.260]   just a timeline so you have an idea because I used a lot of different things
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:29.100]   in a very distinct order and the reason it was was there was this breaking point
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.660]   here on day three and I'll show you and I've got pictures so here's how I did
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.860]   that I like I said one of the things that I've done the entire course of the
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.380]   of the nine days today is day nine actually when I'm recording this video
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:48.300]   and on I've been taking double doses of CCC oil every morning and then every
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.700]   evening I've been putting on topical C-60 oil and not just a regular C-60 oil
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:59.220]   happened to have a Red Lions newest product and you know I'm not I don't
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.400]   know if it's you know that product specifically but I needed coconut oil with
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.900]   C-60 in it and that was like readily at hand and I use that of course I had
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.860]   implemented blood electrification which was the Bob Beck protocol I did that for
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.780]   the first week and then when it was a closed wound I was doing local blood
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.860]   electrification as well as applying oregano oil and oregano oil was for the
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.960]   infection and the blood electrification was for the infection as well and then
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.900]   once the wound was open I started doing ozone cupping now I want to just caveat
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.260]   this is all the stuff that I did and dirt for the durations that I did it
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.620]   and one of the things that I just you know and this is by by all means this is
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:45.540]   my personal opinion again I am not a doctor this is just my opinion I've been
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:50.020]   doing this well over a decade in terms of treating myself using these devices
[00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.300]   using these techniques and so forth but one of the things when I compared what I
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.420]   was going through through every other two every other description I could find
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:03.780]   on Google it was it was exactly the same systems down the line except for
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.220]   one thing I didn't experience any of the symptoms from the toxin I didn't
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.540]   experience dizziness nausea or any of that kind of stuff but but here's the
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:16.740]   thing one of the things is is my body is always saturated with C60 okay I take
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:22.500]   a lot of C60 every single day I do take breaks thing thank God this wasn't one
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.100]   of my break weeks but it was you know I've been taking it for days and days and
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:32.260]   days for weeks and I wasn't on a break and I will I want to reiterate some
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:38.260]   things that I've said in other videos about C60 and toxins right it absolutely
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:44.380]   works for me to help me with my MSG you know I have this horrible reaction to
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:49.480]   MSG I have friends who have fallen in poison oak and not had any ratchets or
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:55.980]   any problems so C60 has and in my opinion and based on anecdotal evidence it has
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.900]   a remarkable ability to mitigate the effects of toxins and so I believe and
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.780]   this is my opinion and my personal belief is that the reason that I that the
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:10.020]   toxin of this bite did not affect me was because when that toxin went into me I
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:15.460]   you know the C60 immediately mitigated it and and nullified the effect so that I
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.820]   did not of did not feel the effects of the toxin but I did and but you know the
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:26.620]   cells and the tissue around the toxins immediately I guess putrefried I guess
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.540]   is the word turned into an abscess and it got very very ugly and it was very
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:36.100]   painful of course but I really believe that the C60 and the fact that I had a
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:41.540]   lot of C60 in me when I got bit was a huge factor towards my recovery and then
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.340]   the rest of it was just dealing with the aftermath dealing with the infection
[00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:49.900]   and so forth so here's the pictures of what had happened this is of obviously
[00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.260]   this is the treatment protocol that I followed and I implemented but right
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.500]   here this is day one this is literally the very next morning and it was just I
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.500]   woke up to this and I'm like I was very surprised that what it started out as
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.580]   a mosquito bite looking thing the skin just immediately started peeling away and
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.300]   the area like I said had gotten quite large this actually right here is is
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.620]   literally bigger than a quarter and so I immediately started doing localized
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.580]   blood electrification using these little ten pads plus I was doing Bob Beck
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.700]   protocol you through my wrist on day two and this is like I tried to take a
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.420]   picture the time the dates you know the times of the day differ but you know
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:31.500]   this is roughly within 24 hours the middle section it had completely
[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.740]   abscessed underneath the skin in the middle section it started to turn very
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:41.140]   very dark within literally within 36 hours and by day three which was I got
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:46.060]   bit Friday night so by Sunday night Monday morning this thing was huge it was
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:51.700]   extremely infected it was necrotic and I had a couple of concerns about sepsis
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.420]   and and just the infection and so I continued to localize blood electrophic
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:11:01.700]   did localize blood electrification which will nullify any pathogens and any it's
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.900]   you treat it you know it's treating your infection of course I'm taking I was
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.740]   taking Clodal Silver I was taking Osanote water with the blood electrophic
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:13.380]   I was doing Bob Beck about three hours a day twice a day for the first couple
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:18.300]   days okay so I was really really just just cranking away on this thing doing
[00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:24.020]   everything I can to basically fight the infection and and then help my body
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.260]   fight that infection so that my body was strong enough to fight off the toxins
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:34.380]   with the help of the C60 and I was putting C60 oil on this thing now by by
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:40.780]   Monday morning which was day three day three and a half this abscess ruptured
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:46.100]   and it it expelled quite a bit of fluid I would say about three or four
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:52.700]   milliliters of fluid came out of my my abscess my wound and then this was day
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:58.060]   four this was that within 12 hours after that once that it was amazing once this
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.780]   thing drained that you could see where I'd started to win the battle because I
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.060]   was doing a lot of different things all at the same time but I was winning the
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.100]   battle you could see the difference in coloration where the dark deep redness
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:14.580]   of the infection had gotten lower much much lower and it was just a pink red
[00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:19.500]   color but this is the this is when I had to switch modalities okay because at
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:24.620]   this point I was putting I was messing with it as a closed wound but by day
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:30.580]   yeah here's by day four I had this scab on it which was the top of this guy
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:35.700]   went out of the abscess but then it came off really quickly and the rings
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:40.980]   right here is the is when I had to once you have an open wound you can't put a
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.620]   regular oil on it and localized blood electrification had worked okay so it
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.380]   worked for me the redness is gone now now I'm dealing with an open wound but
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.860]   again very very susceptible to infection based on the weekend you know
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.660]   condition of my my body at this point but I was continuing to do blood
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:04.100]   electrification I was continuing to put C60 oil on it taking C60 I felt
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.500]   comfortable that I basically got a good handle on the localized infection aspect
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.180]   and I just wanted to keep going with the Bob Beck but now I had an open wound and
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.660]   what this actually we hear this little crater right there was a five millimeter
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:23.380]   wide about three or four millimeter deep hole it was just a hole in me at that
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:29.860]   point and so basically I continued to treat that with ozone cupping and doing
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:35.420]   the Bob Beck protocol I'm putting C60 oil on it this was day five and by day
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:40.980]   six it had really started to dry and started to heal quite well in terms of
[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:46.020]   just drying in the hole filling back up and then by day seven the hole is almost
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.780]   nearly closed again I've got that ring from doing cupping and then this is my
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:55.020]   newest problem and I just made this huge mistake by putting a band aid on it
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.660]   instead I'd had I was putting gauze on it with medical tape you know like a
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.820]   nonstick gauze pad after cleaning it and I made the mistake of putting a band aid
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.020]   on it and I put it one of those big old band aids on it and it turns out that I
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:13.460]   was very very sensitive to the adhesive and you can see the square outline of
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:18.860]   the banded the actual adhesive mess with my skin so I introduced an extra
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:23.020]   problem that I wish I would have known and didn't do that so that's a side
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.220]   effect of you know using those band aids the medical tape didn't seem to
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.900]   affect my skin but this band aid definitely did but just when you look at
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:35.060]   just purely the wound itself the hole it almost completely closed and by day 8
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:38.420]   it's just this little tiny scab right here and that and that's yesterday and
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.620]   so now I'm just dealing with the itching from the adhesive the the
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:47.260]   infection's gone and it's just the the pinkness of from the adhesive and that's
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:53.820]   kind of it and I won the war against the toxins and and the infection of a of a
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:59.140]   very nasty black widow spider bite which you know if you google this and you
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:03.700]   take a look at what happens to other people this is somewhat unheard of that
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.140]   somebody could not have to go to the hospital and take care of it yourself
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:14.300]   but what this case study is demonstrating and what I wanted to share
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:19.140]   with you is that if you're out in the woods or you're out in a boat and you
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.980]   can't get to an ER okay you know what are you gonna do I mean you know okay
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.660]   you're not gonna get bit by a spider on a boat but you never know right but if
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.860]   you're out in the woods hunting fishing camping whatever you know you have to
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.900]   be able to treat yourself and you know and there's only so many antibiotics you
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:38.500]   can carry around with you and and if you don't do well with antibiotics this is
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.260]   an alternative okay but again I don't I don't recommend people try this but I
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.900]   just wanted to show you that it happened to me this is what I did and this is
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:52.140]   the result take it with you however you want but it's this is real stuff so I
[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.580]   just wanted to kind of walk you through the the machines or the devices that I
[00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:02.540]   used this right here is a it's one of the older Bob Beck it's a blood
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.380]   electrifier based on Bob Beck schematics is an open-source schematic that he
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:10.180]   released it comes in a box this is from a company called Silver Smoke Research
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:14.500]   that doesn't exist anymore this is really old stuff you know and I had
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.460]   actually bought several of these things I bought them and then I'd actually
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.740]   retrofit it took the guts out of one of these boxes and I got this little canvas
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.100]   bag so that I could actually I just I just recreated it and then I put it in
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.180]   a bag so then I could put a strap on the bag and strap it to my arm and you'll
[00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:35.340]   see that the it's really very convenient so in blood electrification you
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.940]   basically have two probes plugged into the electrifier and they go over the two
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:44.300]   arteries on your wrist with a little cotton cotton sleeves on top of it and
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.820]   then you wet the sleeves and then you plug it into the electrifier this is what
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.220]   it looks like I use a and just you know if you guys ever wanted to use this there's
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.900]   some tips on this but I use I just cut off the end of a sock and and don't trust
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.620]   me it really really helps hold the wires in place okay so that's what the sock
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.620]   is for the other thing in terms of an and let me just stop right here and talk
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:09.980]   about side effects okay of everything that I did there's only one side effect
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:14.220]   and not accidentally right there burnt a hole in my arm I fell asleep with the
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:19.980]   electrifier running and yeah so I didn't feel it so other than that I would have
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.460]   felt that if I was awake and then I would have you know it's a thing it's a
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:27.500]   thing about you know where you put water you wet the sleeves and so yeah
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.100]   accidentally burned a little hole in my wrist but that was the worst thing that
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.340]   could have happened to me compared to all of the things that could happen to
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.500]   you if you walk into an ER and they pump you full of chemicals okay so anyway
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.340]   that's my personal little mini rant okay so anyway although I did I did mess
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.340]   myself up a tiny bit but that was the worst thing that had happened in terms of
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:50.060]   me trying to treat myself because I am completely well I'm feeling perfectly
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.780]   fine I just have this you know pink spot on my chest now but this is how you set
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.380]   up the probes and then this is what it looks like when you put the sleeves on
[00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:03.020]   and you see put the sleeves on you strap them down you wet the sleeves and then
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.460]   you strap and this is what this is exactly what I did and then I strapped on
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:11.740]   the blood electrifier and plugged in the wires and off I went and then you do that
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:15.740]   for three hours or two hours and then you'd take your clodal silver and your
[00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:19.660]   ozone water now here's another one I just want to show you compared to that's
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:24.900]   like a you know the the silver smoke research a blood electrifier is kind of
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.060]   an older older model now there's a company actually if you want to buy
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:33.380]   like a professional commercial grade Bob Beck zapper there's the soda silver
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.420]   pulser this is one of the older models but you know it's designed for this so
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.380]   they make it very comfortable and easy there's just really nice little you know
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:46.620]   I guess near-frame anyway so you're just gonna stop it but you've got the
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.320]   near-prem wrist thing and you've got these really convenient probes they
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:55.660]   Velcro to the thing so you can set it to the spacing you want it comes with the
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.020]   armband and it's built to be mobile that way you know because if you don't have
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.580]   it like this where it's mobile or you can like you know it's a pain in the butt
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:07.660]   you just have to sit still for a while now for the localized blood electrification
[00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.580]   which a lot of people don't realize you know you can do that and yeah you
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.760]   you absolutely can what you do is you just get it it's a this is a these are
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:23.340]   tens pads tens T E N S which stands for trans neural electrical transdermal
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:29.780]   electro no I forgot his tens for but okay you look it up okay but it's a
[00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.780]   tens pad usually use it for your back pain and muscle pain and things like that
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.260]   so they come with little pads these things snap on and off just like an EKG
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:42.020]   pad and you just get that same wire and it goes to one eighth inch plug and you
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.100]   can use it for localized blood electrification and you can do it for
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:51.060]   localized zapping this is an old dog bite wound that I have on my arm so and
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.620]   this is actually when I had that dog bite this is how I treated it and so you
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.380]   just put the pads on either side of the wound and then you go ahead and plug it
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:05.140]   into your blood electrifier now in this case this model right here is from a
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:10.540]   guy named Michael Forrest is straight he's got dragon fly is his website and he
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:15.060]   builds them himself just like the silver smoke research guy and then
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:20.020]   basically this thing allows you to either you could do blood electrification
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:24.260]   via the Beck method which is at four Hertz or if you are familiar with Halda
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:29.620]   Clark who wrote a book called the cure for all diseases and she was all about
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:34.020]   using 10 Hertz was her what her findings were in her research and so you could
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:39.020]   you could pulse at four or ten or even 40 Hertz you can use a dampened wave or
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.980]   a square wave and then you know you're on and off button and so what I did was I
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:48.460]   was doing like two hours of four Hertz two hours of ten and then I did some
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:52.620]   40 but it didn't really do matter but between Beck and Clark I was able to do
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:57.220]   the sufficient frequencies and running that through the wound itself because I
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.620]   have a pad on each side of the wound that I was able to eliminate the
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:05.220]   infection completely within just a few days now from an ozone standpoint I
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.260]   wanted to share with you I just have this I have in my kitchen I just have
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:12.140]   this ozone generator in my kitchen where I just you know I just that's how I
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.460]   clean vegetables and stuff but and then I can make ozone water so the plug goes
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:22.140]   into the bottom of the machine now to make ozone water I bought from this
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:29.820]   company called promo life I bought a a special ozone water bubbler and it
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:34.580]   comes in this glass tube and the glass tube extends into the flask and then
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:39.260]   there's a glass bubbler the thing about ozone is it's really really eats up
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:44.940]   anything so the hose has to be special it's a silicon hose when the gas comes
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:48.500]   into the water and bubbles back out it goes through this little vial and the
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.260]   vial contains magnetize and that nullifies the the harmful effects of the
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.780]   ozone the one thing about ozone is you could put it into air or you could put it
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.740]   on your skin and no problem but you don't want to breathe it you don't want to
[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:04.300]   breathe it it will mess up your lungs and so you need to have a like basically
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.540]   that this is an air filter for the ozone so the ozone goes into the flask it
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.540]   comes back out through this vial and out through this little hole and then you
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.540]   barely can you smell it just a little bit but the whole idea though is you want
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.820]   to filter it out so because you're standing there or it's in your house you
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:22.780]   do not want to run an ozone an ozone generator into the into the air and
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.940]   have any you or your animals near it so that's what this is for it's a special
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:33.060]   ozone bubbler that you get with ozone medical supplies and so I have one of
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.260]   these I this is how I do it and you can see where there's the there's right here
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.180]   there's the glass and then there's the bubbler and there's just anyone a year
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.700]   when one liter flask will work and you just put it in there you put the water
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.780]   in there and you run it I run it for 20 minutes and then I drink it during the
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.700]   blood of the Bob Beck protocol and then this is actually one of the stones that
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.940]   comes with it with the with the machine itself but I don't use that now this
[00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.380]   right here is the cup you can get this at promo life as well and this is just
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.500]   like cupping acupuncture wise but this is for ozone so again you've got the
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:09.340]   silicone tubing you've got the manganese air filter so that the when the ozone
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.180]   comes out it doesn't affect your lungs and then you just take that and you just
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.060]   cup you cup the wound that's what the circle was that you saw in the pictures
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.860]   was I put this cup over the wound and I would run at five minutes at a time
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:26.020]   every day for the whole week as soon as I had an open wound I switched from
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:31.100]   oregano oil to ozone cupping and it will you know well in my opinion it will
[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:36.140]   eliminate any pathogens on the surface and then in the blood and in the tissues
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:40.380]   itself you're you're kind of attacking the in the infection from two directions
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.940]   right you're tacking it topically and then internally Bob Beck internally cupping
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.420]   externally and so you cut it from both ways and that's how I was able to just
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.900]   eliminate the infection so quickly but that's what the cupping device looks
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.500]   like and this is just what I do and it's I just set it up in my kitchen I actually
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:03.780]   have a medical grade ozone generator that has an oxygen condenser that comes
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:08.020]   with it so but I just didn't break it out I just this this actually worked just
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:12.940]   fine it worked just fine for me and I was pretty happy with the results so
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:17.420]   that's it that's the case study I just wanted to share it with you I wanted to
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:24.340]   share that you know it's possible to heal thyself you just have to know what
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:28.820]   to do and use the right things but again you know I do want to state again
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.780]   that you know you should definitely seek medical help this black widow spider
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:37.420]   bite is nothing you should be messing around with I take the you know I have
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.260]   personal responsibility over my health I'm a grown man I could make these
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.860]   decisions for myself so you make decisions for yourself I just wanted to
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.780]   share this with you and not get sued so anyway so thank you very much for
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.260]   watching the video I do want to let you know I'm still active in the C60
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:57.540]   community on on telegram and this is actually a C60 video the C60 actually
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:03.340]   you know kicks in here it really I'm telling you I'm so glad I was I'm on C60
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:08.380]   because you know that's a huge deal when it comes to toxins but also to you
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.860]   know I've started a telegram chat group for folks that are interested in
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:17.780]   biological magnetics such as Bob Beck and these types of things so there's the
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.140]   address right there if you want to come join us and kind of just listen in and
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.820]   chat with us and ask questions about these kinds of devices and so forth so
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:28.260]   you're more than welcome to join if you're into bioelectro magnetics and of
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:33.740]   course we still have our C60 chat group on telegram which is continuing to be
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:39.420]   active and the co-op is going great and so forth so thank you Mary again for
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:44.540]   for watching the video and I hope I hope this helps you in in one way or
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.220]   another aloha
