[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Carbon 60 video by me, Kay Elmer, and in
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.400]   this video I'd like to just cover with you some information I gathered by
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.560]   talking to various individuals in the C60 industry as to how coronavirus is
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.640]   impacting their business and just any of their personal opinions about what's
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.520]   going on right now. So I thought that would be very interesting to share with
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.760]   everybody and I just put this video together. I do want to say this is a
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.120]   re-record. I did release this for about a day earlier this week and there was so
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.040]   much new information in the last few days plus I made a mistake which I
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.040]   apologize for and so now I just want to do a full re-record and put this
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.800]   information out again because I do think it's very valuable and I think it's very
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.580]   eye-opening as to what's going on as far as coronavirus and the C60 industry.
[00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.680]   So let's just jump right in what I did and where I got the idea for doing this
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.300]   video was on the February 22nd and February 28th Sarah Westall had
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.200]   interviewed a couple of individuals in the C60 industry and in those
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.800]   interviews you know they brought up the fact that they were having problems
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.240]   finding bottles and that kind of just like you know just set a flag off in my
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.640]   head that you know there's gonna be an impact as you know there's you know
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.520]   people running around all over the country now swiping up you know toilet
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.760]   paper and bottled water but you know like what would happen to the C60
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.600]   industry for those of us who have come to rely on C60 as one of our daily
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.120]   supplements so I thought that was really interesting so there are links in the
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.360]   video description below for all the companies mentioned in this video again
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.040]   you know as typical I just want to mention it's not an endorsement this is
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.720]   me sharing my research so but you know Max and Phil from Live Longer Labs 22nd
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.400]   of February mentioned that they had a shortage of bottles they were having a
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.840]   hard time finding bottles you know they buy by the thousands right and that they
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.360]   they were starting to recommend the people you know you when you finish your
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.520]   bottle if you buy it commercially you know don't throw it away they were
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.800]   suggesting that there may be a point where if they if producers can't get
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.240]   bottles that it may they may switch to a system where you send them your old
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.160]   ones they sterilize them and then refill them and send them back so so it's
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.200]   definitely a good idea at this point for everyone just you know just you know
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.280]   start being frugal about things like that and think about the reality that you
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.800]   know we won't get resupplied for a while because China's been down for so
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.600]   long on February 28th Ken Schwartz talked with Sarah on the Sarah West
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.160]   all YouTube channel and he had the same con he had the same comment he
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.600]   actually said that he had to go warehouse hunting all over China to find
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   bottles and then he actually stated that you know based on what he learned
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.920]   trying to get supplies for his company which is C60 purple power that he
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.160]   stated in the beginning of March all of the current ships from China will have
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.960]   unloaded and there's nothing after that which is true if you look on the
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.920]   mainstream news right now I just watched a interview of the port authority for
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.360]   LA the port of LA and it literally it's it's it's quite empty so you know the
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.680]   chips the ships have slowly trickled down because of the shutdown in China
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.440]   and you know there's gonna be a point and a gap in our supply line where you
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.200]   know we're gonna run into shortages and things like that so definitely it's
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.320]   something to think about as it relates to C60 now we also talked a lot in this
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.800]   video this is actually very good interview if you want to learn more about C60 and
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.600]   how the coronavirus works because Ken is a chemist and he's talking about it
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.880]   from a chemist standpoint and he did mention that the virus what the doctors
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.440]   have been finding and scientists have discovered that it just depletes the
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.800]   body's glutathione and it basically causes a radical oxygen species or
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.680]   radical you know a free radical storm in the body that the body it overwhelms
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.560]   the body's ability to overcome that and all that free radical does all this
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.040]   damage and he said that you know that he knows that you know that his statement
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.360]   was that C60 can play the role of glutathione which is what's getting
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.640]   devastated and depleted as these viruses ravaged people so it can actually play
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.120]   the role of glutathione when you're when people are devastated by the virus he
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.080]   also said that vitamin C helps and so I'll get into that in a little while but
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.360]   you know so that was comments from Ken Swartz so when I saw these two videos I
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.920]   really thought you know hey you know what else is going on so I reached out to
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.520]   several people that I do know I know these you know six individuals and
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.640]   and through Dave Chase at C60 Labs he got in touch with Dr. Pierre-Louis Brunner
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.440]   of the Salares Camp the Canadian C60 Ross C60 chemical company and got a
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   quote from him for this video so thank you for that Dave so now when I reached
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.560]   out to Bob Gresca with Gresca C60 I reached out to Martin Redlion talk with
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.480]   and this is all via email by the way talk with Ian Mitchell at C360Health he
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.280]   also runs carbon 60 plus and live pet Dave of course at C60 Labs and Rebecca the
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.560]   C60 company in the UK and then Philip Von Holzendorf of Leela Labs in Germany
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.440]   so I kind of just tried different countries you know what's going on that's
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.440]   what this video is all about is what do these people have to say about how the
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.600]   virus is affecting their business and what they're hearing from customers all
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.480]   right so let's jump right in to what folks had to say Bob Gresca with Gresca C60 in
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.000]   the United States got back to me my question essentially to all of these
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.960]   individuals was you know you know what are you hearing are you having in your
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.360]   in issues with your supply chain and what do you think you know because these
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.720]   are all very experienced professionals in the C60 industry and so Bob rolled
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.480]   back to me and said today it appears there has not been one scientific study
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.960]   on carbon 60 and the and the coronavirus which is true even though there is not
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.480]   a lot even though there is a lot of speculation that C60 will help against
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.720]   coronavirus there's no scientific evidence that C60 will be effective
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.360]   against coronavirus there have however been studies on functionalized C60
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.920]   atoms or molecules chemically attached to C60 and viruses these studies on
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.560]   viruses and functionalized C60 have reported promising results it would be
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.320]   a sumptive and premature to conclude similar results based on our non
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.080]   functionalized C60 and a different virus which means you can't take the the
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:07.680]   results from people tweaking C60 for drug type of of objectives and comparing
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.880]   that to the commercial C60 oil product that people use for supplements okay so
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.640]   Bob further goes on to say I could not personally make the conclusion that C60
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.880]   will help with the coronavirus as there's no scientific studies to back up the
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.720]   speculation and I cannot legally give medical advice very smart thing to say
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.040]   but he does say yes we are seeing an increase in sales but no supply chain
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.760]   problems so that's really good to hear from from Bob he's located in Colorado
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.320]   so so far no supply chain problems increases in sales and I really want to
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.680]   make a point of what Bob saying here is again you know you know I try to remind
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.720]   everybody all the time when people forget because it's been around for so
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.000]   long now the C60 still not been approved by the FDA it's still been no human
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.680]   trials have been published it's still very you know experimental and that you
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.280]   as you taking it you are part of the grand human trial on this thing so yeah
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.160]   it's very experimental and it's a very good reminder that that you know of that
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.820]   fact okay so but really good points that that Bob is bringing to the table now
[00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.360]   when I chatted with Martin from Red Lion he's located in Ireland I basically
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.560]   said that COVID-19 seems to be like the flu on steroids so far none of our
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.600]   customers have caught the flu this winter if anything I got a sniffle which
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.840]   went away I have a young daughter you know what schools are like centers for
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.960]   disease I got not a single thing for her this year even when she had the flu I
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.680]   didn't bother taking any precautions but still no flu there then there's the
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.880]   older lady who worked in the building with bad air and she also reported no
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.840]   flu this season and a few other people and that's a lady that he comments in
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.560]   his in his last newsletter I believe so I'm going to ask people in newsletters if
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.740]   anyone has caught the flu using red line 60 olive oil it would be great if we
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.560]   got feedback on this because obviously we can only surmise the results until
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:00.480]   someone with COVID-19 uses red line or red line 66 olive oil or 66 olive oil in
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.920]   general and then he asked me perhaps you could help in this I want to make a
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.680]   plea for for a feed you know for data so right now sales right now are getting
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.400]   stronger by the day I think that because people have realized they've got no
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.200]   flu this season for example we got our first order from Saudi Arabia the other
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.800]   day I expect sales to peak in July prefer not to get sales this way but then
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.640]   again it could be very positive I have to agree with you that it isn't going
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:31.840]   away anytime soon and so what yeah I mean at the end of the day I mean there's
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.080]   there's a there's a case to be made that C60 is really helpful for the immune
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.640]   system as you know from all the other videos I've made other people have made
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.240]   you know what does it do it it helps your body heal itself because of its
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.880]   ability to scavenge all of your radical you know free radicals in your body and
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:52.040]   so he's noticing that people who are taking C60 aren't getting the regular
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.840]   flu and we're all and so that really piques my interest to say well how how
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.640]   are you guys doing for everybody who watches this video if you take red
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.120]   line or if you if you if you don't take if you take another product if you could
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.560]   just comment please you know it's marcher ready right so if you could just
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.640]   comment in the video comments I'll pass this along to Martin but what we want to
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:17.120]   know Martin and I we would like to know for people who are taking 60 C60 oil
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.640]   have you and specifically his product but you know whatever product you know
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.120]   have you caught the flu this year and that would be very indicative if we
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.600]   find that there's a ton of people who have not and then you know and that are
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.240]   you know that are taking C60 oil and that would be a very very interesting
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.080]   data point so if you could help us out please comment in the video about how
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.280]   you're doing this year with in relation to illnesses okay and then you know it's
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.280]   just more data the more data and the whole purpose of this video is to the
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.480]   more we know the more we share information amongst ourselves the better
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.200]   decisions that we can make about what we want to do for ourselves and for our
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.480]   family and that's really why I'm presenting this video and collecting all
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.040]   these different comments and sharing them with you so the more data we can get
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.840]   the more we collaborate you know the better will all be from it so please if
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.520]   you could do that that would be awesome okay so speaking with Ian Mitchell and
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.600]   by far Ian Mitchell if you know who he is he is literally the top scientist in
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.040]   the C60 field and again he is in the United States he operates out of two
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.840]   different labs I know one of them is in Colorado I think and anyway his good
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.760]   product or his company he's got three that's C360 health carbon 60 plus and
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:29.520]   live pet so he does a pet product as well as C60 pet product now Ian got back
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.560]   to me and said I foresee it definitely hitting the supply chain is not I'm
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:39.600]   sorry as a lot of the factories that produce C60 were in Wuhan which I was
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.080]   very surprised I did not know that that's that's an amazing because Wuhan has
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.080]   been shut down for weeks and so try to imagine all of that C60 that's not
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.760]   being produced and not being sent out to everybody who buys it so I think it
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:55.080]   will so I'm sorry Ian goes on to say I think it will likely spike sales as
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:59.360]   people always make emotional sales choices and fear is a pretty hefty
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.880]   emotion very true it is a great overall mitochondrial supporter and has shown
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.000]   some antiviral properties so I imagine a lot of people will be pushing it for
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.760]   this there are some recent studies using intravenous vitamin C showing that it
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.920]   slowed down symptoms in low-level cases but did nothing to affect patient
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.920]   outcomes in more severe cases people will likely make the leap to C60 because
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.080]   it's a stronger antioxidant and they will think that correlation is
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.760]   meaningful I think somebody will crack it soon and I figure there are quite a
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.920]   few ways to do it so I wouldn't be it wouldn't surprise me if there is a way
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.920]   to do it incorporating C60 doing it meaning finding a way to cure to treat
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.380]   you know coronavirus but unfortunately and unfortunately it still isn't
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.280]   mainstream enough to garner the researchers probably required to pull
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:52.760]   that off okay so very very prudent information and that you know in
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.320]   speculation here that you know by C60 could help and it could be very helpful
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.460]   and eventually it'll just take some time for that to actually come out I don't
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.720]   know if you knew this but I and Mitchell's actually developed a cancer
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.480]   serum using C60 as a carrier so so you know he if anybody knows he's got
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.560]   several patents to his name how to do this kind of stuff it's it's I am thank
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.240]   you and by the way and thank everybody who's got responded to me and now Dave
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:23.640]   over at C60 Labs in the United States basically he stated for C60 Labs I got
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.800]   concerned about the potential supply issues late January the cobalt glass
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.720]   bottles caps bottle reducers and oral syringes we all we use are all
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.160]   manufactured in China or Taiwan so we purchased and stored large quantities of
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.000]   each item very very smart Dave at current production levels I'm confident we have
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.980]   over a year's worth of packaging supply so yeah that's that's someone looking
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.520]   future you know very smart while we have not seen a noticeable increase in
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.960]   business over the past few weeks I am answering a lot more questions from
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.360]   concerned customers the general consensus seems to be that doing anything to
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.200]   boost immune levels will go a long way towards helping to fight off this virus
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.360]   as with most viruses and ailments and I completely agree and it goes right back
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.520]   to Martin's point it goes back to IAN's point you know that C60 you know if
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.600]   there is speculation that it can help and so you know so definitely there's
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.960]   something there now Rebecca is from the C60 company located in the United
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:26.280]   Kingdom and I and she rolled me back and said at the moment I do not see any
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:31.360]   impacts as long as the C60 you are buying is from a USA lab I don't buy
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.760]   anything from China for our supply chain so not concerned at this stage
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:40.160]   however I do understand that even the even they USA Labs buy the graphite
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.880]   rods from China so eventually all supply has the potential to dry up and then the
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:49.580]   prices will increase I've seen a massive uptick in sales since Saturday and this
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:55.080]   is last Saturday today is March 8 2020 so since last Saturday clients are
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:59.240]   putting in huge orders to stock up for the next 12 months at the moment I am
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.840]   struggling to keep up with demand and products are selling out before they have
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.360]   finished their manufacturing cycle I've ordered enough C60 to get me through
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.560]   the next two months and will assess the situation again at the end of this
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:14.840]   month interestingly I had an email from China today offering me C64 sale they
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.920]   were based in Wuhan difficult to get the truth out of the Chinese at the best of
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:24.440]   times but I thought Wuhan was on lockdown which they are so you know you
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.120]   never know okay so thank you Rebecca and then when speaking with Philip Von
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:33.880]   Holzendorf owner operator of Lila Labs in Germany he responded regarding our C60
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.040]   cosmetics powders and oils I don't really foresee any change anything change for
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.000]   us since we do not buy anything from China and I don't see any components
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.320]   originating from China we only buy high quality organic oils and other organic
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:52.640]   ingredients that we mainly buy in Germany Austria USA and Canada as an
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.320]   example organic olive oil or organic hemp seed oil are all products that also
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.600]   our suppliers don't get from Asia so at this point I don't see an issue because
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:07.480]   of that that's awesome however if at a point of panic should lead people to
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.480]   buying hoarding products then this may impact all products eventually lastly if
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.520]   the virus at some point were to spread similarly from China and also similarly
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:20.520]   impact Europe and the US then will also be heavily impacted so you know and since
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.760]   he wrote this to me we all know what has happened in Milan so it's definitely in
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.440]   Europe at this point so yeah that's how fast you know things are changing right
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:35.440]   now now Philip also goes on to say oh that for the C60 market in general I see
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.760]   prices increase by the way and shortage play a role probably that is only
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.560]   partially because of supply chain it's rather the combination with increased
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.680]   demand due to the virus we will keep prices stable as long as we can and are
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.120]   not impacted by any shortage or price increase ourselves so that's that's that
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.560]   seems to be going really well in Germany good job and thank you Philip so now
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:02.960]   Dr. Pierre-Louis Brunner of Solaris Kim responded to Dave and this was shared
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.280]   with me in his response to the questions that I posed to everybody was of course
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.000]   China slowed down on the production of many materials and supply for all of
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.560]   for all the industries I believe it is more critical for the complex
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.320]   manufacturing involving multiple parts coming from all over the world such as
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:23.320]   the automotive industry is only one part is missing the whole line is frozen
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.600]   however the situation is temporary and they seem to have the situation fairly
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.560]   under control manufacturing in China was stopped anyway for the festivities as
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:35.760]   usual and resume slowly later on the bright side it is clearing their skies
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:40.240]   which is very true if you've seen the NASA pictures for us we were also very
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.320]   lucky to have the inventory renewed early this year so here's another
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.760]   producer another manufacturer that bought their annual supplies early very
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.480]   very very smart even if most our suppliers are from North America and
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:55.440]   Europe with China cut off these suppliers also experience shortages due to higher
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.880]   demand for more local suppliers this is also what happened to us recently when
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.760]   where we saw an increase in demand do most probably to customers that needed a
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.480]   new source besides their Chinese suppliers we are trying to have a good
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.040]   amount in stock to fulfill these demands our customers that are on a
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.640]   monthly base plans are prioritized in case temporary shortage due to large
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:22.080]   larger sales volumes so this is a very important point everyone is that you
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.560]   know even if the company you're buying from doesn't have a shortage or they
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.800]   don't deal with China it's all the people who do deal with China are getting cut
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.760]   off from their supplies and so where are those customers going to go where are
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.400]   they going to go so you know there's definitely you know the power the
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:42.360]   possibility if not the probability of shortages in the near future both in
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:47.680]   terms of raw materials oils C60 graphite rods bottles I mean all of it's just
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:53.400]   you know we're looking at you know that there's gonna be an impact and so if you
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.560]   step back and think about it and I first I just want to say thank you everyone
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.960]   for responding to my my requests for information thank you for contributing
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.760]   to this video I think again the more information we have the better
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.840]   decisions we can make so if I were to summarize you know kind of like what
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.080]   everyone was saying you know bottom line is what I'm hearing is sales are
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.680]   increasing so you know it's just like everything we're seeing in the news and
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.800]   there are impacts to the supply lines versus right now it's only bottles you
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.200]   know what will it be next you know oils or whatever so now I think the
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.840]   another thing that's really kind of poignant is that you know I had pointed
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.440]   out vitamin C is a potential treatment and so what I did I don't know if you
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.160]   noticed my other video I think a few weeks ago right I actually created a
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:40.400]   video because the zanghua sorry if I mispronounce that hospital in Wuhan
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.240]   started a clinical trial with high-dose intravenous vitamin C as a treatment
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:51.000]   for coronavirus since February 13th that video was done there have been two other
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.920]   clinical trials with high-dose vitamin C being you know trialed in in China
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.720]   right now in Hubei province and so I just wrote a blog post a couple of days
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:06.840]   ago as an update to that video and one of the critical updates that has come
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.080]   out I believe Monday which was last Monday that today's Sunday this prior
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:16.080]   Monday I think was March 3rd it came out that the Shanghai government
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:22.800]   officially endorsed high-dose vitamin C for coronavirus and so if there's a
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:28.160]   link to my blog in the video description it's the most recent article it lists
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.280]   all of the different you know all the different press releases and things like
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.720]   that that have come out about those clinical trials and these are real
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.520]   formal clinical trials they're registered with the clinical trials.gov
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.640]   and they're very and there's all the list of all the doctors that are involved
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:48.240]   and the institutions that are involved this is very formal and so what's what's
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.600]   happening with vitamin C now with high-dose vitamin C is that there's three
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.400]   trials there's been sufficient evidence from the first trial that you know there's
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.600]   been tremendously large quantities of C-60 ordered and delivered and trucked
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.800]   into Hubei province and that now the Shanghai government has come out and said
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.840]   this is the treatment for coronavirus so unfortunately I you know I searched
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.640]   mainstream news Google YouTube and that story has not made it out into the
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.280]   general public yet but it's out there if you click on if you go to my article on
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.520]   my blog click on the links you can see the actual government press releases and
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.840]   all of the people and institutions behind these clinical trials and this
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:31.640]   announcement so it is a huge deal and and so I want to point that out as point
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.200]   number one here that vitamin C is a potential treatment if you haven't heard
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.400]   about that watch my video read my blog article about this the second thing is
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:46.840]   is that C-60 as iron alluded to and some other of these individuals have eluded
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:52.360]   to is it is well technically it's 172 times stronger than vitamin C as an
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.720]   antioxidant and now vitamin C as a strong antioxidant and taking high dose
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.040]   vitamin C knocks out this virus then you know the question remains and this is
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:05.720]   what iron was eluding to which is what happens if you use C-60 you know it's
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.440]   it's way stronger and what would happen and then what we just don't have enough
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.720]   data which is what Martin is asking for is hey folks could you you know just
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.280]   chime in you know let us know how things are going so it's it's very
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.800]   probable that that C-60 is going to definitely strengthen your immune system
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:26.800]   during this escapade we're living through and it also could possibly be possibly
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.640]   be a treatment now I want to make a very important claims name claim here in the
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.880]   fine print just like in the pharmaceutical ads these statements have not been
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.080]   approved by the FDA and are not to be construed as medical or health advice
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:41.600]   all right but I want to get back to my bullets so it's possible it's probable
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.640]   it may be highly likely that it's it's going to help and so I would say to you
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:52.000]   guys if you're taking C-60 keep taking C-60 it's going to help you one way or
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.240]   another now if you actually get the virus a high-dose vitamin C is proven
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:02.360]   through those clinical trials and this might be a good fallback you know as
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.000]   as another possibility so I just wanted to share that with you that's kind of
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.280]   what I got and then also my other research on vitamin C and I really do
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:15.200]   want to point out something over here you know the FUD is is strong boy the FUD
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.240]   is strong on this whole story fear uncertainty and doubt and I just want to
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:25.040]   say that I'm not at all trying to push that I really want to bring you the
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.520]   science I want to bring you what people professionals in the field who own
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.800]   their own companies are saying this is not hearsay this is directly from the
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:38.320]   sources if you if you look at those links that I put in my blog article or my
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:43.760]   other video it's everything is backed up by the science and by the research and
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:49.680]   and by what's been published so I don't want anyone to construe anything that
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.440]   I've said in this video or anything that anyone else has said in this video as
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.240]   any fear uncertainty or doubt these are all facts these are scientific facts
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:01.480]   and anything that is speculation I really want to make sure it's clear that it
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.240]   is speculation so I don't want to push any FUD on you guys there's enough FUD
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.640]   already so and then as you listen to other videos and as you do your research
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.800]   you know there's a lot of fear I mean there is I mean with us be honest with
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   ourselves but you know keep in mind the distinguish between someone trying to
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.640]   share information with you and someone trying to scare you okay so the last
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.200]   thing I want to say and I just want to bring this up because this was in the
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.040]   prior video that I I'm gonna take down I did take down and replace with this
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.680]   video was the announcement that Monty has decided to take a break for running the
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:37.960]   C60 telegram co-op and so you know this incredible gentleman has spent this is
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.960]   Monty over here with his lay you know thank you Monty because for over the last
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:47.160]   year and a half he has single-handedly run the co-op at his own expense literally
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:52.520]   he puts out a considerable amount of money I mean tens of thousands of
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:24:00.000]   dollars buys huge lot you know lots of C60 personally rez packages them into
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.040]   little one gram vials personally does all the labeling personally does all the
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:09.960]   shipping and handling and going to the post office at zero zero profit I mean
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:15.480]   literally at cost it's been completely voluntary and he's done batch after
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.640]   batch after batch and and at this point you know Monty is just needs a break and
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:25.360]   so I just and we're just you know so Monty's taking a step down and the
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.480]   entire community and there's over 500 of us and and like he told me is like you
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.360]   know when it first started it was like maybe a couple hundred of us and it was
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.760]   manageable but now there's 500 it's more than doubled and he just couldn't keep
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.560]   up with it anymore because he has a very you know he's just like the rest of us
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.080]   he's a working guy a full-time job family the whole bit so but you know so he's
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.720]   taking a step down wanted to say thank you from the community thank you from the
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.080]   bottom of my heart for what you've done I mean it's the most generous thing you
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.040]   could ever do which is volunteer your time away from your family to help
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.320]   complete strangers save money so they can improve their health and I just want
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   to say thank you so much Monty thank you very much for what you've done so
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.240]   now he's taking a step down and and honestly for a few days we didn't know
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.480]   what we were going to do I announced this in the first version of this
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.800]   video that you know we're just not going to have one and then I just want to say
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:20.080]   you know by the universe is good graces Philip Von Holtzendorf of Layla Labs
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:27.080]   found out that Monty was stepping down and by you know just absolute
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:33.760]   fortune us you know just alignment of the stars whatever but Philip has
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:39.240]   volunteered Layla Labs resources to take over production of the telegram
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:44.600]   co-op you know and so what what's gonna happen now and and by the way thank you
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:49.560]   so much Philip I mean the community is so thankful there are so many people who
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:54.200]   want to take C60 who just absolutely can't afford it it's just beyond what
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.360]   they can pay and that's what the whole co-op was designed to do but you know
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:03.720]   but so what Philip's doing is basically he's running at bare bones minimum
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:08.880]   you know profit he's going to basically take over all of the orders of this of
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:15.280]   the C60 co-op the telegram co-op but it's got it has to conform to his
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.520]   existing fulfillment or it's gonna cost him more money and he's he doesn't have
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.560]   any margin I mean other he has no room and he's not making any money so he
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.800]   doesn't have any he can't run it at a loss nobody can run a business at a loss
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:32.080]   so what he's asking me to convey is that Layla Labs is gonna rescue our co-op
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:37.320]   you can buy C60 through the co-op Layla Labs will be the fulfillment and the
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.960]   payment wing of that and but it fits into their how they do stuff which is it's
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:47.320]   gonna be a minimum a two or five gram order going forward we used to do I think
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:51.120]   Monty used to actually even sell down to the half a gram but now you know it's
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.200]   just only gonna be two or five and then everybody that comes in from the co-op
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:01.960]   is gonna get the co-op discount and I think Monty was selling C60 for 110 plus
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:07.560]   shipping I think it's only gonna go up to maybe like 115 120 plus shipping so
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.680]   it's only a little bit more for Layla Labs to take it over and when you look
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:18.200]   at the price of retail C60 you know it's like 230 240 I mean so it's still at
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:24.200]   120 it is incredible co-op bargain and thank you and if you guys ever talk to
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.600]   Philip or DM and please give him a thank you for for the community because
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:34.160]   he's doing a huge favor and not making anything off of us to kind of pick up
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:38.080]   and take care of the community and that is just awesome I mean it's how many
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:42.680]   people do you know like that so thank you Monty thank you Philip for helping in
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.480]   the telegram co-op and helping all the people that benefit from the co-op so
