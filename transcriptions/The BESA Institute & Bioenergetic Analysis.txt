[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   So I just want us to stipulate that the company is that handles these studies is
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.760]   referred to as BESSA. And what BESSA stands for is the International
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.240]   Association for Bioenergetic Systems Analysis, the IFV BESSA. And it's
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.520]   really run by two seasoned and veteran clinicians in holistic practices who
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.680]   have just been spending decades of their career under the guise of biosystems
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.600]   analysis, which is also referred to in the industry as Meridian Stress
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.320]   Assessments, okay. Now the two individuals are Wolfgang Hangs, Albright and Eva
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.140]   Kranke, and their clinician or their clinic is located in Austria. Now this
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.440]   what they do is they provide services to all a range of different industries and
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.280]   different technologies from agriculture to technology to products and so forth,
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.560]   where they study the effects of these products and these practices that
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.960]   people want to have evaluated on what's the effect of people and animals as
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.120]   they're interacting with these products. And so that's why, you know, just to give
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.760]   you some background, that's all these people do is they conduct studies, they've
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.400]   been doing it for decades and they're very, very accomplished at doing what
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.920]   they do in terms of evaluating the health risks of all sorts of different
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.320]   things. And these folks have been doing this in Europe and they're one of the
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.520]   most highly qualified clinics in Europe that conduct studies for for anybody
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.920]   who wants to see the effects of what they do and their products and their
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.440]   practices, you know, on humans and animals, okay. Now that what they actually
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.040]   use for their materials and methods of their studies is they refer to as, you
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.440]   know, again, as bios energetic systems analysis, which is a, I'm going to say, a
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.600]   deck of vol type of device and I'll explain what that means, where it scans
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.480]   roughly around 60 points along the surface of the skin. So in other words, you
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.960]   know, an individual or an animal, if they're testing against a product, in this
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.480]   case, the product was an electric vehicle, then what the investor will do is
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.840]   conduct multiple redundant studies, you know, usually, you know, several studies
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.200]   across the road with different participants that they call proponents, I
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.440]   guess, or respondents or something, sorry, I'll get into it. And then so they take
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.440]   these individuals, you know, the test cases, and then they'll measure them with
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.200]   before, you know, before they're ever exposed to something, then they'll measure
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.360]   as they're exposed, then afterwards, and they measure 60 different points along
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.200]   the surface of the skin using their own proprietary, you know, analysis device.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   And what those measurements will do is analyze the effect of the thing, you
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.840]   know, in this case, again, you know, it's electric vehicle, on its effect on the
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.520]   energetic systems of the body as it relates to the, you know, the condition
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.600]   of the lungs, the skin, and test ions, connective tissue, stomach nerves, organ,
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.880]   bladder, liver, abdomen, heart, etc. So there's all of these different things that
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.400]   they'll test for to see, you know, what is the impact of this thing on the person
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.040]   or on the animal in all of these different categories here you see in the
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.680]   bottom of this slide. So the thing that's really important, though, if you've
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.040]   never heard about biogenic systems analysis, or if you've never heard about
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.320]   meridian stress assessments, I want to give you a little background about the
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.600]   science and the technology and the validation of this practice. Now, this
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.640]   was developed, the idea was developed by a doctor Reinhard Wohl back in the
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.960]   1940s. This was 80 years ago, and this doctor, he was a medical doctor at the
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.560]   time, and he became very dissatisfied with the diagnostics, you know, methodologies
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.080]   that at the time in the 40s that the medical establishment had in terms of
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.880]   trying to diagnose any one of his patients as to what their problems were. So then
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.320]   he could then, of course, you know, develop a treatment plan. That's your
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.960]   standard animal for any doctor. You know, they need to do a diagnostics and then
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.240]   they need to figure out what's wrong with you, or usually they guess based on a
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.520]   bunch of test results. And then they come up with a treatment plan and the
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.240]   unfortunate part in today's environment, in my opinion, is that, you know, they
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.560]   have to guess at what would be the best treatment plan for what they think is
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.920]   wrong with you. And then you always get that speech right at the end of your
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.440]   doctor visit, which is, well, if nothing happens or it doesn't work, you know, in
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.280]   a week, come back and see me, we'll reevaluate your dosage or your
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.680]   prescription, you know, that whole thing about, you know, let's try it for a week
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.280]   and find out because they really don't know, at the end of the day, what is really,
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.000]   really, really wrong with you, or, you know, your condition. And then, of course,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.480]   you know, because of that, they're guessing at what's going to solve that
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.360]   problem. So now, what Dr. Reinhardt Vol spent decades doing was trying to
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.560]   figure out, okay, now, how do I improve the process of diagnosis so that I can
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.880]   then really understand what the problem is so that I could then, you know, develop
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.360]   treatment plans that would be appropriate for that problem. So then, what he did
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.800]   was, is he, he went and started looking at traditional Chinese medicine, because
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.040]   what he wanted to understand was, okay, what's a better way to diagnose instead
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.920]   of doing all these blood tests and, you know, all, you know, the stuff that they
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.720]   do, right. And then, so what he discovered was, if you applied the concept of
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.680]   traditional Chinese medicine, because for thousands of years now, right, I mean,
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.960]   this is what's really important. If you understand, the general idea of health
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.720]   care is that, you know, how long has, you know, the traditional medicine practices
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.360]   that we kind of are, you know, subjected to in our current society, which is
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.200]   standard American, you know, the standard American care, American medical
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.480]   association, they develop a standard of care. And that's only been around maybe
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.400]   a hundred years, right? It's only a hundred years. But when you look at Chinese
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.640]   traditional medicine, that goes back thousands of years. So that's why he looked
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.560]   towards that. And then basically, working with those practitioners at that time,
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.400]   and they were able, now they're able, because of their training and their
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.560]   experience, able to diagnose with quite incredible accuracy. So he figured out
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.560]   that, you know, the method that they were using was actually having the body tell
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.600]   you what's wrong with it, because the body can. And they discovered that,
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.720]   whereas a traditional acupuncturist can then, if you've ever been to one,
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.720]   they'll basically look at all these different things about you. And but they're
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.240]   going to be putting their hands on you, and they're going to be with their hands.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.200]   They're trained to basically feel the energy flow through your body through a
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.400]   system of your body is like a very complex, beautiful machine with tons of
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.320]   wiring in it. And there's, and it's energy, and that energy is flowing all
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.600]   through that wiring, and all those wiring of, you know, those, those energy, what
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.880]   they call meridians. They reach out to all the different organs and all the
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.920]   different parts of your body. And you are basically this really complex, you
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.960]   know, machine that's really wired, and everything's wired together. And if they
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.160]   get, and they put their hands on you, and they can sense how well that energy is
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.240]   flowing from point to point. And so what he did was he took the, you know,
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.120]   basically being a westernized doctor, he decided, well, if, you know, is there a
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.280]   technology that could do that for people like himself and other doctors who aren't
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.440]   trained Chinese, you know, practitioners? And so then what he did was he, he
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:25.320]   developed a device that could then send a particular level of voltage and current,
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.520]   like we're talking microvolts, microamps, right, that this device will then basically
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.640]   transmit into the body. And then he would measure it at the two points, the
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.440]   beginning and the end of any one of those particular wiring points, because
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.800]   now the wiring points are all meridians. And to kind of give you an example,
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.800]   there's, you know, here's the map of the body. And so you've got your meridians,
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.640]   let's say here, I'm just going to give you the top one here, the stomach one.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.680]   It starts up here in the, in the, in the forehead, and it comes all the way
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.560]   through the body, and it ends right here. And this is the thousands of years of
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.680]   Chinese traditional medicine has discovered how the body is wired. So he
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.480]   already had a blueprint. So then when he took the technology and he put like one
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.880]   probe up here and one probe down here, and then he would measure the current and
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.160]   the voltage going through the body through that one particular meridian. And
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.720]   based on the information he got back from the measurement of that, he would
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.480]   determine the actual condition of the stomach. And so, you know, and this is
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.480]   where he applied traditional, you know, doc, you know, basically health care
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.880]   practices or diagnoses practices against, you know, using this technique based on
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.000]   the Chinese traditional medicine. All right. So what he discovered, based on
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.080]   just just decades of analysis and experimentation, was that when he would
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.280]   apply the current and voltage at one point of the meridian and then measure it
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.720]   coming out the other end of that meridian, right? If the voltage and the
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.280]   current remain the same, then he discovered that it meant that that
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.400]   particular organ and that particular meridian was an optimal condition. That
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.200]   was a healthy person, and this is from measuring the both, right? He would
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.720]   basically measure using using this, you know, this meridian stress assessment
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.000]   methodology, and then he would apply traditional diagnoses to it, and then he
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.920]   would compare the two. And over time, we're talking decades, he spent his
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.760]   career doing this and developing this. There's actually a device out there,
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.880]   out there in the world you could buy called the decavol device that actually
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.640]   is what he developed. And so it's still out there on the market, and tons and
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.520]   tons of holistic folks use that in today's world. But there's other devices
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.400]   now beyond, you know, just his device, as shown here in this slide, you know,
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.960]   Bessah Institute developed their own decavol device. You'll find other decavol
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.400]   devices, one's called a bioscan. So there's other devices out there that are
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.640]   now being used, and not just the one that he developed, but I digress. So
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.920]   going back to his actual results, where he would evaluate using the, you know,
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.840]   his, you know, basically his marine stress assessment methodology, then he
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.400]   would compare that to your standard diagnoses, where he would actually test,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.960]   let's say, this example of the stomach, all the different ways you would test
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.240]   the stomach, you know, if you were just a regular doctor, and then he would match
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.760]   the two results, and the results over decades of time he developed this device
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.920]   and this methodology. So at the end of the day, if the current coming in is the
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.920]   same as the current coming out, you're healthy. That part of your body is good
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.760]   to go, and you are in a good optimal state. Now what he discovered was if he
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.760]   put that current and that voltage through a meridian to a specific, you
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.040]   know, let's say a specific part of your body, spleen, gallbladder, heart, blood
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.680]   circulation, lung, all these different meridian points that tied to different
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.600]   organs. Now if it came out and the voltage at the end of the meridian, he put
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.000]   it in on one end and he'd take it with measurement on the other end. Now if it
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.680]   came out and the actual voltage decreased, then then when he would go in
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.960]   and actually do an analysis, regular, you know, you know, doctor analysis, then he
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.920]   would discover that that particular part of the body was in a disease
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:13.320]   condition. It was actually damaged, it was diseased, right, and then and that's how
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.120]   he determined that, okay, if I see the voltage come out lower, then it's going
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.560]   to be where what I'm looking at is diseased, that it's definitely damaged
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.680]   and it's got a problem that needs to be treated. Now the other end of the
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.880]   spectrum is if now if the voltage increased, so he put in, you know, a set
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.280]   amount of voltage in current and one point of the meridian and he measured it
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.120]   at the other end of the meridian, if the voltage increased, then he discovered
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.240]   through all that study that then when he went into the look at that specific
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.600]   organ or that specific meridian area, then the condition of that organ was in a
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.880]   degenerative condition and that's just the words he used. Degenitive means that
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.160]   it was stressed, inflammation, it was starting to show the signs of weakness.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.400]   In other words, this was under a lot, you know, that you're having a lot of
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.520]   problems with this thing, you've caught it before it got damaged. That's what's
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.880]   key here. You've caught the problem before it's damaged and then he would
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.960]   develop a treatment plan for that and so that's the actual way to do it. That's
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.360]   the scientific approach that he developed called the meridian stress
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.800]   assessment using a deco-vole device, which then you look at the Best Institute,
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.040]   they developed their own deco-vole device, they do the same types of
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.600]   measurement, they measure the meridian points, they evaluate the organs and then
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.360]   they come out with a treat, you know, basically, well, they don't develop the
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.160]   treatment plans, they just would create the study that says, "Hey, this is what
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.800]   it's doing to the body." Okay, so they're doing the studies, but this is what it's
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.880]   based on. So when you see the results in the study, I'm going to share with you. I
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.960]   wanted to let you know, that's how you interpret the results, that this is a
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:56.560]   science that has been around for 80 years. Now, as to why, you know, the
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.360]   healthcare industry does not adopt this, I can't answer that, but I'll tell you
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.160]   what, that based on all of his work and all of the different doctors that have
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.840]   followed his work in the last 80 years, this methodology is spot-on and it
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.680]   marries directly to, you know, what the Chinese have been doing for thousands of
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.680]   years. So the device now, and when you look at the results of the study, I'll be
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.320]   sharing in a second, they basically color-coded it to make it way simpler to
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:30.240]   interpret. And so the four different color codes from the results that are
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.840]   coming from the analysis is going to be green, that basically shows that you're an
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.760]   optimal energy state, meaning that the current in, the current out is the same.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:43.360]   You're healthy, it's good, you're good to go. Yellow is that it's inflamed, it's
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.560]   starting to go, but you know, it's starting to get stressed out. The blue is
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.680]   degenerative. It actually means that, you know, you've got damage, you're being
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.000]   damaged. It's not just a little bit of inflammation and discomfort that you've
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.320]   got some damage and that there's problems. It's a, you know, it's very
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.120]   serious to understand that there's, you know, you're being damaged. And then
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.360]   the red, it comes out, it just shows as your total deregulation. So if you see
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:13.200]   red, that means bad. That means like, okay, you've got a chronic serious problem
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.400]   with that area, okay? You know, so you can, you know, obviously you can realize,
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.120]   right, damage does not name mean, damage does not mean you're, you know, like
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.480]   severe, right? So it's just, that's the scale, right? It goes from perfectly
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.040]   healthy, to being affected, to blue, being, hey, you're being damaged, you're
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.960]   flat out, you know, being damaged. And then red means you are completely damaged
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.240]   at that point. So that's kind of how they did the scale.
