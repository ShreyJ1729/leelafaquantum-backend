[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.080]   I'm your host, Kay Elmer, and this video is a Lele Q,
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.680]   otherwise known as Lele Quantum Tech
[00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.160]   and Quantum Upgrade product updates.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.400]   I had a chance to talk with Phillip this week,
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.520]   the owner, operator of Lele Quantum Tech,
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.280]   where we talked about a bunch of different topics.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.040]   And one of those topics was what are the new products
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.240]   and services that are recently launched
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.000]   that we haven't talked about in our on this channel,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.480]   as well as what are some of the new things
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.480]   that are coming down the pipe over the next year.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.080]   And so Phillip was gracious enough to give me a few minutes
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.640]   just to kind of give me an update
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.480]   as to what is expected when.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.440]   And I know you guys love this kind of things.
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.640]   I'm looking forward to it as well.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.600]   So I just wanted to share with you that video clip
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.000]   on all of the new stuff that's in the works
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.440]   and when it's gonna be launched
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.960]   or when it's planned to be launched
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.760]   so that you can kind of get an idea,
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.240]   like what's coming up and all the good news for that.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.280]   So here we go, I'm gonna go ahead and play the clip
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.880]   because this is such a popular topic
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.520]   in the chat groups is like, hey, what's coming up next?
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.520]   And what can we expect and when?
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.240]   So if you don't mind, can we just kind of,
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.680]   I know you got a hard stop in five minutes
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.640]   or maybe just like a quick little elevator speech
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.520]   but the list that we're seeing right now on the slide,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.920]   these are the five things that you've posted about
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.680]   and just kind of wanted to get an update on them.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.120]   And if you have time, maybe what else is not on the list.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.040]   But so since we last talked about new products,
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.320]   you've launched a 360 Perception Boost on Traum EZ.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.960]   We haven't covered that in any video.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.960]   So for people that didn't know about that,
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.360]   could you kind of describe what that is for Traum EZ?
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.240]   It's part of the app now and it's called 360 Perception Boost.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.280]   - Yes, this is a quite interesting one
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.720]   because it's literally the case when you wear glasses,
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.360]   sunglasses or contacts of any kind,
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.360]   that it's almost as if it's cutting off yourself
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.720]   from your soul.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.320]   Now that doesn't really fully work,
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.000]   but it's a disconnection that happens.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.080]   And you're then suddenly just very focused
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.120]   on what's in front of you
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.560]   and you're not really connected to the big picture anymore
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.160]   and you lose your 360 Perception.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.040]   - Of course, if someone like a crew or a Roman
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.080]   would put on glasses or sign glasses,
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.920]   it doesn't happen to them, right?
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.320]   Because that's a different level of consciousness
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.400]   and awareness that they have and connection, right?
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.680]   That they have so deeply established
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.840]   that that just doesn't happen.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.960]   But to the random person,
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.960]   which I would say is like over 99.5% of the people probably,
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.880]   it happens to them, right?
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.880]   As if their field has really an impact.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.040]   Now, this Perception Boost counters that
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.240]   and if you wear glasses or contacts,
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.000]   you're fully still in the 360 Perception,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.040]   which is that's what you want, right?
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.800]   That's your innovation, that's everything, right?
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.640]   That's the connection, the conscious connection
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.440]   or at least subconscious connection to your soul and all of that.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.960]   That is what it does.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.520]   - Okay, cool.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.240]   I know you've got a hard stop in three minutes,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.160]   so let me just ask you each one of these
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.520]   and if you could just tell us
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.080]   when do you think they'll be released
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.400]   and we'll get into the descriptions.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.200]   I can provide those in the chat group afterwards,
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.160]   but you mentioned the super grand block in January.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.240]   Is that correct?
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.440]   That'll be released in January?
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.880]   - That's what you're trying.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.720]   - You're trying, okay.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.720]   - That's what we're trying.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.480]   - Okay, and if everything works out,
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.720]   then yes, it will be ready then.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.280]   And then in the Quantum Masterclass,
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.600]   I'm assuming you mean the basically
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.680]   Quantum Wellness Practitioner course.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.560]   - Okay, that's what it's called, okay.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.280]   - I think more or less,
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.680]   I think we haven't fully named everybody.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.800]   We're working on it and I honestly,
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.520]   I think we wanted to launch it this year
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.800]   and maybe we start in this year,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.000]   but I would say at latest, it will be also in January.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.520]   There's not so much more that needs to be done.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.080]   It's just technical stuff now at this point.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.480]   And then it's about the whole description website,
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.320]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.600]   So, you know, it would be January,
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.360]   maybe a little bit before.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.920]   Quantum diagnostics, okay, yeah, that's a TAFA one.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.120]   That's for quantum upgrade.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.440]   And I don't know, maybe a year.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.600]   We haven't made a lot of progress there
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.160]   just because we've been swamped with a lot of other things.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.840]   But that vision is obviously a big vision
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.600]   and a very concrete vision and we're gonna work on it.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.280]   But yeah, I think this will take probably at least a year.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.800]   And quantum eye drops,
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.800]   it will be either Q1 or Q3 of next year.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.200]   - Okay.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.240]   - Just because we have to go through
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.480]   all of these different hoops
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.800]   and make it available through a nonprofit
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.560]   and we're having all these discussions right now
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.360]   and nothing else is really set up.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.200]   - Okay.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.040]   And then we're working on it.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.880]   - Okay.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.440]   - And then I wanna add our sleep product,
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.160]   which it's at this point just still an idea.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.760]   - A sleep product, is that gonna be different
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.120]   than the contest that's running right now,
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.520]   the calm and sleep frequency?
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.720]   - I don't know if we will use that for that.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.160]   We, that's actually a good point.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.080]   We may be able to include that at this point.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.920]   We already have the physical substances for that
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.400]   and we've tinkered around with our own frequencies
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   to add to that.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.120]   So we're at a pretty good point.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.480]   But yeah, since the contest is going on,
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.120]   this may well be an additional layer to it.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.160]   And it would be quite exciting actually
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.400]   to infuse it there as well.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.680]   But we, we don't know, right?
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.280]   So the first frequencies were actually delivered
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.440]   several days ago and I think yeah,
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.040]   I'll take us some time to go through all of that.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.560]   But that's an exciting, exciting process.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.560]   - Yeah, I'm looking forward to that one.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.400]   Okay.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   So then you mentioned the jacket.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.120]   When, when's the new jacket gonna be out now,
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.040]   out for sale?
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.000]   - We try for this year so that for this winter,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.800]   people will be able to have a real quantum down jacket,
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.840]   which looks awesome.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.840]   It's, it's literally, it will look as good as a $900 jacket
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.160]   that does not help with EMF and that does not have any silver
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.360]   and that does not contain a heel 360 frequency
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.080]   with quantum energy, but it will have all of those things
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.560]   and it will look great and be warm.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.840]   - All right, so it'll be available
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.440]   for this coming up holiday season?
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.060]   - That is what we're targeting at this point.
[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.900]   - Awesome.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.120]   - We're working heavily on that.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.960]   - Yeah, awesome.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.800]   That's good to hear.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.320]   And the other one question is the contest results
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.240]   for the calm and sleep frequency.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.000]   When do you think that you'll be able to tell everybody
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.400]   who won that and all that stuff?
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.480]   - In November.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.320]   - In November.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.400]   - And I'm guessing the second half of November.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.240]   - Okay.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.040]   And one last question that's coming up is that
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.720]   are you guys planning a black Friday sale?
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.640]   I've been asked that multiple times.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.480]   (laughs)
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.800]   - Hmm, what should I say?
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.720]   - Yeah, I always say that you usually do,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.560]   but don't count on it, you know, whatever,
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.320]   but what's the words?
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.720]   - I'm not allowed to say it, but you know, you--
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.880]   - No spoilers.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.840]   - We usually we do something, right, don't we?
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.960]   - Yeah, usually we do.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.880]   Okay, no spoilers, guys, just like Yellowstone.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.840]   Okay, so thanks so much for your time.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.120]   I really appreciate it, Phillip.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.520]   I know you gotta run, but thanks so much
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.960]   for clarifying all this stuff.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.400]   I'm gonna put this together and get it out to the group.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.680]   And if everybody has more questions, just let me know
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.880]   'cause I just keep a list.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.720]   And then I catch Phillip every now and then.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.120]   And we'll just go through these
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.640]   and just answer everybody's questions.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.640]   - Thanks so much, Kay, you're amazing.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.120]   And thank you everyone out there.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.480]   And yeah, all the best to everyone.
