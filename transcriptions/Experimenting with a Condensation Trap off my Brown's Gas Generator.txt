[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   Hello Internet! This is Kay Almer from the Tinkers Academy. I'm doing something new
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.220]   well Tink and I just wanted to share it with you so I just recently got one of
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.960]   these and these are called condensation traps and what they're meant to do is
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.440]   capture all of the basically the liquid that's coming through through the gas
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.040]   so that it doesn't get into your cannula so I decided to go ahead and buy one and
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.600]   actually get them on Amazon two at a time so I got a couple but I'm just
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.400]   trying this one so I wanted to kind of show you the rig so I got a connection
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.840]   tube and it's coming off of my number two bubbler and it's just hanging there
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.840]   and then it goes into the trap which is the condensation trap and then I pulled
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.280]   out a brand new cannula to kind of see and compare to my other cannula that I've
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.880]   been using for quite some time and I just wanted to show you that this one I've
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.800]   been using for quite a bit of time you could see that right there I mean
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.280]   there's like liquid you know water or condensate in the cannula I've been
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.440]   using this guy since February 8th it's March 31 so a couple of months so you
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.960]   can see even though I kind of I use the whip it method where I swing around and
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.920]   blow through it and just trying to continually keep the the fluid out of
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.360]   that cannula and so I decided well you know it's kind of a pain in the A and
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.760]   then so I decided well why don't I try this condensation trap so this is the
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.080]   experiment I've got it all hooked up brand new cannula no fluid at all I'm
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.120]   gonna give it a try for a week and then I will report back to say whether or not
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.920]   the experiment was successful there you go
