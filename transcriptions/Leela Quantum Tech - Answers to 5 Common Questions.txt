[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. I'm your host
[00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.960]   Kalmer and in this video I'd like to just cover five common questions that I get
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.020]   and see in the telegram chat groups for Layla Quantum Tech. I figured I'd just
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.160]   make a video so I can just link the video next time I get asked the question. So
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.780]   we're gonna be talking today about five of those common questions. One of them
[00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.860]   is about quantum healing, two overcharging and the copy effect, magnets and how they
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.260]   affect you know the quantum energy, placing photos in blocks and upgrading
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.540]   your blocks. So let's jump right in. Now the first thing about quantum healing
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.280]   that I think everyone needs to kind of get a you know get an understanding
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.860]   about is that it's just one part of our overall physiology. If you wanted to
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.780]   kind of take a look at you know like what is the human body comprised of and
[00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.000]   we're three really separate things that all combine into one being and that
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.680]   being you know we have a biochemical component right molecules, vitamins,
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.760]   supplements, drugs, all that stuff you know we're just this chemical hodgepodge
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.140]   of essentially we're an 11 and a half gallon saltwater aquarium with about
[00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.760]   eight pounds of minerals. So you know we are biochemical and we are physical so
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.660]   we can't ignore the fact that there is that component of our being and our
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.400]   health. There's also a bioelectro aspect of it as well. I mean we are literally
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.160]   electrical beings. We are powered by electricity and we all of ourselves
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.720]   actually carry a very slight voltage and that's how we process all of the
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.440]   different chemical reactions within us is all done through electricity. And then
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.520]   the last thing about us as human beings is that we're energy beings also known
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.760]   as light beings. And so when we talk about quantum healing and a question I
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.240]   see all the time and telegram is you know people come in and you know and
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.840]   nothing wrong with this at all but you know it's like oh I've got or I know
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.160]   someone who's got multiple sclerosis or I've got someone who has liver problems
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.040]   or I've got a bad knee. And you know and so the whole first thing that you know I
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.080]   want to just stipulate is that the Lele quantum tech products and no
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.560]   product. I mean I've been in energy I've been in the energy world forever and
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.240]   ever. I mean I've just really kind of got into it decades ago I've been working
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.800]   with energy devices for all that time especially and also as bioelectrical
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.560]   magnetic devices and things like that I'm really big into health and healing. And
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.240]   so the thing I want to point out is number one number one and even in the
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.480]   disclaimers at Lele quantum tech is that these devices are not medical
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.080]   devices. You know it's not a you know like a panacea or a silver bullet that's
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.440]   going to solve a physical problem that you're having. It's just not. That's not
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.120]   what quantum healing is all about. What quantum healing does is it addresses
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.040]   one aspect of your being of your health and your wellness and that is your
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.120]   energy. And so what quantum healing devices do is well as the quantum
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.040]   healing service you know that quantum upgrade is the energy is you know in
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.560]   other words Lele quantum tech has found a way to amplify that energy in it and
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.920]   they can basically concentrate it using their tools and then they can amplify
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.160]   it and they can transmit that energy. And that's whatever energy you want to call
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.360]   it. There's really no kind of really good language for this yet but the idea
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.480]   though it's like life force energy it's Chi prana or gone you know there's so
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.880]   many different words for this energy that we know is all around us we can
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.720]   feel ourselves transferring energy between each other you know as we interact
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.080]   with each other and even with our pets people can feel it we know that there's
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.520]   this energy all around us and you can tap into that energy. And then if in you
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.920]   know for most people can tap into that energy but if you really want to kick
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.680]   it up a notch you can get these tools that can then actually concentrate and it
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.240]   actually even filters energy so you can filter out negative energy that's going
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.680]   on in your space with these tools as well. But the idea though is that they
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.680]   found a way to concentrate that energy and when they concentrate that energy
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.520]   and you're sent that energy or you're wearing a capsule or you're putting your
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.360]   hand in a block or even in the field of a block that sort of thing then what
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.960]   it's happening is you're being sent extra energy beyond what you yourself
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.440]   you know contain okay now there's other ways to do that and there's an actual
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.920]   really incredible practice it's the original form of martial arts it's so
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.720]   old that there's no date on what when it started but it predates everything and
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.960]   it's called qi kang right or qi kang and so depending on you know what whether
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.680]   it's the Chinese or the Japanese version of it but the idea though is that the
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.360]   qi kang masters figured out ages ago that you could pull that energy out of the
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.960]   out of the ether and then concentrate that qi through this practice called
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.800]   qi kang and then you could actually then you know actually you could actually
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   move it it's called it's all about concentrating and moving energy within
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.560]   yourself you know I studied under you know daoist monks years ago and learned
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.320]   qi kang that way and that's why when Leila came along and Philip came along I
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.800]   really understood what he was doing because it's very similar to that practice in
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.680]   terms of concentrating that life force energy within you now obviously not
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.400]   everyone has that that training and so for those of you don't that's what these
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.040]   capsules and cards and blocks do you know the service does is it gives you more
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:30.440]   qi it gives you more energy and that energy then helps you your body enlightened
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.200]   yourself you enlighten yourself physically into a healing state and it
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.560]   participates in the in the actual activity of healing and that's why the
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.320]   studies that we're seeing out there right now there's this wound healing
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.120]   study going on where they're actually measuring scientifically measuring that
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.680]   wound healing is it happens faster with this extra energy being sent to the
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.920]   person right we've seen people actually have major injuries where they're using
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.840]   these quantum healing devices and they heal faster it's not overnight again but
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.520]   it helps their body it supports your body heal yourself that's key it's
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:14.000]   supporting your supporting your body to heal yourself to heal yourself through
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.840]   your own energy then it just gives you more energy to do that but here's the
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.920]   thing you know nothing's a cure unless you address all of three things and so
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.400]   I think the thing that really comes along I think the biggest point I want to
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.520]   make to everybody is that you know when you're dealing with a problem and you're
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.680]   looking at tools and things that could help you you know address those problems
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.920]   and it could be anything lime disease you know comes up a lot as as a topic but
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.280]   the idea though is if you're not addressing right if you're not
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.920]   addressing the bio electrical aspect of your body you're not addressing the
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.440]   biochemical aspect of your body and you're only doing energy well you know it's
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.520]   gonna help it's gonna help your body but your body's still gonna struggle
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.800]   because it's only one part of the solution that's gonna help you so I just
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.680]   want to point that out that quantum healing is about helping you increase
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.560]   the amount of life force energy within you that then helps your body heal
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.120]   itself it's not a silver bullet though it comes with the other two if you want
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.440]   to see full recovery or full improvement so you know it does help it's never
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.640]   gonna be a negative thing because it's all positive life force energy right but
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.160]   the idea though it's only one of one of one of a you know of a multi spaceted
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.560]   solution so there is no medical device that's called a quantum healing there's
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.200]   no magic med bed kind of thing where you know you're just gonna boom you're
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.080]   cured you know it's gonna be a solution that's comprised of three separate
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.680]   components of which energy is really important not if you just did the
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.840]   biochemical I mean you know right everybody knows we all experience quote
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.900]   modern medical care and what do you do you go in there and they give you some
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.800]   drugs and if you don't work you know come back next week kind of thing and
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.220]   you're always on some new drug and then you take a drug for another what the
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.720]   other drug did and blah blah blah and that's why you don't really see a lot
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.420]   of great progress or you know perform you know there's so many people get
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.640]   frustrated with their doctors because they don't ever get better they just
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.020]   keep taking different drugs or different doses of drugs and so forth
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.620]   because again they're only addressing one aspect of their overall being you
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.440]   know and so it's a combination of the three and that's I think what's really
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.280]   important about quantum healing and when you come in and say oh I have a
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.840]   problem yeah it's gonna definitely help you it's gonna help your body help
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.680]   itself but unless you're looking at the other two things as well and approaching
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.560]   it as a whole 360 view of your being you know you're not gonna really see the
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.600]   incredible results that you're gonna want to see so keep that in mind that
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.760]   quantum healing is super helpful but it's not the only thing that's gonna help
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.460]   you in almost all situations unless you address everything else as well now
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.020]   the other aspect of quantum healing that I want to point out is the idea of the
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.660]   frequencies right so it's more than just so the energy as I just described you
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.220]   know it basically increases your own life force energy now what is the other
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.020]   part of it though is frequency medicine so now you can go ahead and go on YouTube
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.540]   and go you know anywhere you want to go you can you could search on these terms
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:13.620]   but the frequency medicine is the idea of of just the fact that you know energy
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.760]   right is what is it's basically everything is just energy is just if you
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.600]   try to visualize what energy is right it's light and it's moving and
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.800]   anything that's moving is vibrating anything that's vibrating is has a
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.120]   frequency so everything is vibration and everything is frequency and
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.200]   everything's energy at the end of the day and so now the whole concept of now
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.700]   if you want to start introducing frequencies like a lot of people say oh
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.860]   so-and-so like my you know I heard a saw on the other day like oh I think my
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.620]   cat heard its paw you know what would you best you know what would you recommend
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.660]   for the frequency and obviously it's gonna be heal right because a heal
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:54.820]   frequency is is to help specifically a frequency on top of the energy to help
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:10:01.540]   you heal right that it's it's basically I think Philip once described it as it
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.580]   wasn't I think if I'm sorry I think I'm getting confused we have the news
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:09.480]   frequency called primal source but this is the heal frequency has the healing the
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.380]   primal healing frequency the healing of of creation you know of your cells being
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.760]   able to do what their cells need to do and that energy that causes that to
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.000]   happen okay so it's built into that frequency set so the idea here now
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.520]   frequency and I want to kind of point you out to something called German new
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.760]   medicine you can look that up it's a practice where people have kind of
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.400]   finally kind of figured out that hey you know what all of our traumas all of
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.180]   our problems that are physical and or emotional or mental are all tied to these
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.760]   frequencies that are trapped within ourselves and so I kind of have this
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.840]   illustration here of the human bio field and you know some people call this or I
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.640]   call it the bio field you can look that up as well there's a ton of books about
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.480]   the human bio field and but at bottom line though it's this bubble of energy
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.440]   that we that that that is us right we generate this energy field around us and
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.360]   and it could be is you know for really really strong vibrant people it's a big
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.320]   ball for you know people that are weak low-cheats a smaller ball but either
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:14.200]   way you've got this this ball of energy around you and what happens is one of
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.880]   the things that's theorized with German new medicine and frequency medicine and
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.520]   in those you know basically those theories is the idea that all of our
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:28.520]   physical maladies are a reflection of of a frequency that we entrapped into our
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.240]   bio field and it's manifesting as a physical ailment okay so here's the
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.000]   thought right something really bad happens to you and all of a sudden you
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.680]   have migraines and you don't you know and so you're solving trying to solve the
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.960]   migraines with your doctor giving you tons and tons of drugs nothing's working
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:49.480]   but the idea though is that what happens is is that trauma or injuries are a
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:54.080]   reflection of frequency that's been trapped in your bio field in fact
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.580]   there's a really great video and I'll put a link in the in the video description
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:03.160]   below of the of the person who started this concept of bio field tuning her
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.200]   name's Elaine and she's just our Eileen and she's got her whole thing called
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.640]   bio field tuning dot com or something like that no affiliation but she put out
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.280]   a video once I thought was just this fantastic she wanted to just explain
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.040]   her theories and what she had discovered in in the 20 years that she's been
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:24.200]   working with tuning forks you know another way of doing frequency where you
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.520]   know in her world and it's a very I think it's very poignant and I think it's
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.320]   very applicable to the concept of quantum healing because it's frequency medicine
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.880]   combined right but the idea though in in in the physical world if you have two
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.160]   tuning forks and you have one just sitting there and you to and you bring
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.560]   the other one and you and you and you basically you know hit it and it starts
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.560]   to vibrate those vibrations carry through space and all of a sudden and
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.760]   when you get close enough to the second fork the second fork starts to vibrate
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:00.520]   it's a sympathetic you know resonating at a sympathetic vibration so then all
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:05.120]   of a sudden the other fork will start to vibrate that matches the first fork
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.720]   right so you've got 4k and 4k and the two things start to vibrate at the at a
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:13.640]   resonance and it's called entrainment so they the first one entrains the second
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.080]   one to start vibrating at the same rate well that's really how it all works
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.360]   that's how we all operate so we ourselves are operating at a you know at a
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.880]   vibratorial state right and you bring in an extra frequency in there and it
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.360]   starts to entrain with your own what the concept of frequency medicine is is
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.680]   that if you start doing bio field tuning or you start using these frequencies
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.000]   with Leila or any other service that you know provides these types of you
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.440]   know solutions then what happens is you see all these little blotches here those
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.560]   are all trap frequencies that are basically tied to a physical element like
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.360]   bat you know your back hurts all the time where you have digestive issues well
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.480]   some of those issues or if not all of the issues if you read you know if you read
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:02.160]   up and study all of this stuff is tied back to some frequency that's trapped in
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:08.280]   your bio field then you're using another frequency to entrain these little you
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.400]   know problem areas then after a while you can kind of just entrain these
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.080]   frequencies with a different frequency and then all of a sudden this thing
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.920]   vibrates and leaves your bio field and when that frequency leaves your bio
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.760]   field and all of a sudden the problem that it caused in your physical body
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.400]   goes away okay so you know it is it's kind of complicated but the idea though
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.600]   is that with frequencies you can entrain to a positive frequency that negates a
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.600]   negative frequency and you can remove it from your bio field and then the
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.960]   physical problem that's associated with it goes away and that's kind of called
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.880]   quantum healing and you know right now it's kind of the language isn't really
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.920]   solid in terms of like explaining exactly what everything's going on but
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:56.880]   these are the two concepts here you've got frequency medicine in in you know
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.880]   in acting with quantum healing so that you're pumping energy in to help the
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.640]   body and they're using a frequency to entrain and negate negative frequency
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.000]   and the more of these things you can get out of you that you can kind of just
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   kind of just make them disappear because you've entrained them with a
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.960]   positive frequency and you basically null them out then as these things kind
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.520]   of go away from you you start finding that those physical problems go away
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.480]   from you as well so that's the idea behind quantum healing it's it it's one
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.440]   of three things always you know it's not a silver bullet but if you approach your
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:33.280]   whole physical health and wellness from the concept of hey you know what we are
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:36.840]   more than just one thing and if you approach it in a three-dimensional way
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.920]   right a 360 and then you start using frequencies to kind of null out the
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.840]   negative frequencies that are trapped in your bio field you're gonna start this
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.480]   fine healing and that's the key thing about how this works is that it takes a
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.800]   lot of time a lot of energy right and to help your body do what your body you
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.240]   know is meant to do which is to heal you okay so now the second thing that I get
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.720]   asked a lot about or I see come up a lot about is the concept of overcharging
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.000]   and then the copy effects so right off the back you know there's you only you
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.920]   only can overcharge something with a block okay now there's four separate
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.160]   blocks you can purchase or you can own and so there's a quantum block a travel
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.160]   block an infinity block and a grand block okay and these are all quantum
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.600]   devices that can charge other things to the effect that you can actually
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.200]   overcharge well one thing about it that you need to know is that quantum blocks
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:34.240]   are designed where they just never overcharge no matter how long you leave
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.720]   something in there it'll never overcharge us you never have to worry about
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:42.680]   overcharging when it comes to a quantum block but the other three blocks will
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.160]   and so what overcharging means is that there's a set of guidelines on how long
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.840]   you should leave stuff in there if you want to basically concentrate energy
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.480]   into that device object whatever whether it's a you know a crystal or a phone
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.880]   or a watch your keys yourself you can put yourself in the block and you can
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.480]   charge up right and if you stick to the guidelines you'll be fine you know it's
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.160]   it's you'll have you'll have the the optimal charge for that thing right that's
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:14.160]   based on the guidelines given to us by Philip and Roman who invented all of this
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.320]   stuff however if you leave stuff in these other three blocks then they become
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:24.520]   overcharged meaning that they have more energy than what was their design to
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.800]   have that they were kind of you know in the end you know Roman and Philip and
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.280]   the healer network they kind of came up with all these guidelines because they
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.760]   they basically you know kind of work with this stuff for years to figure out
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.680]   what's the best way you can use these things for optimum you know experience
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.240]   and that's what they came up with they're just guidelines so the first thing I
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.520]   want you to know is a you can't overcharge in a quantum you can with the
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:52.920]   other three be if you overcharge something in fact I read a post today on
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.320]   telegram someone left there someone left a stainless steel bottle in one of
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.040]   their blocks for I think a whole day and they're worried like what you know
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.240]   what what's gonna happen now nothing's gonna happen now now you've got a
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.160]   supercharged you've got a supercharged water bottle awesome you know it so
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.800]   nothing negative will ever happen that's the thing there's no there's no
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.200]   downside to any of this right I mean how much you know I mean giving yourself
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.920]   body you know energy to heal to help yourself heal charging something giving
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.080]   yourself more energy giving you giving you an item more energy no there's no
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.680]   bad thing that's gonna happen there's no downside however there's an issue that
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.960]   comes up when you overcharge something and it's called the copy effect and that's
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.720]   the only thing that could happen but it's not necessarily a negative thing so
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.880]   what the copy effect is and this is what's really important to understand about
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.180]   overcharging okay so overcharging not a bad thing don't worry about it if it
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.760]   happens it happens I've overcharged tons and tons of stuff I've overcharged
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.000]   myself you know so but you know hey it nothing negative happens however now
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.640]   there is that one issue and the one issue is the copy effect and so now this
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:01.360]   is for illustrative purposes only right but there's two things are gonna cause
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:06.160]   the copy effect okay and one of them is when you overcharge something by the
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.320]   length of the charge so even if you have let's say you only have one block and
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.460]   you and that's not the quantum remember now we're not talking about the
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.160]   quantum block quantum blocks you know off the chart off the table in this
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.080]   discussion but the other three blocks if you leave something in the any one of
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:27.040]   those other three blocks longer than the guidelines tell you to so let's say
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.880]   brand new this is what it looks like you get a card and it's got a field and
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:34.600]   it's a certain amount of strength and you know and it's working just as designed
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.840]   by the lately healer network okay now if all of a sudden you put it in there and
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:42.200]   you forgot or you put it in there for 30 minutes straight you forgot or
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.560]   something happened or you put it in there 10 minutes three times right either
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:52.840]   way it's a cumulative so now you've added 30 more minutes of energy to it
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:58.480]   from a much stronger block so then now because of the accumulated time of
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:03.720]   charging that that card is now overcharged and now all of a sudden it's got
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.760]   more energy than it was and you know than it was intended to have and so now
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.920]   the field is bigger and stronger okay and that's what overcharged means it's
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.360]   just got more energy and its field is a little bit bigger but if you put that
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:21.920]   bigger field that stronger object next to a weaker object then whatever
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:26.280]   frequencies on that object is gonna copy over to the other one so in other words
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.800]   if this thing's been in 30 minutes and this one's just brand new and you put
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:34.000]   those two cards next to each other right with so that they're overlapping their
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   fields then what's gonna happen is the stronger object is gonna copy its
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.520]   frequency on to the lesser strong you know the lesser energy I guess not a
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.080]   strong object okay so then all of a sudden now you're gonna have two
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:51.520]   frequencies on this one and only one frequency on this new one right and so
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.920]   then you're gonna bet you're basically you're not blending necessarily you're
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.520]   adding on the new frequency that copied onto it is not gonna overwrite the old
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.360]   one all of a sudden now you've got a card with two frequencies and another
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:10.040]   card over here with one frequency and so now is that a big deal not really right
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.800]   however if you're someone like myself who's really into tinkering around and
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.000]   you want to keep everything organized and clean like if I I want all of my
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.120]   cards to only have that one frequency right for me because you know when I
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.960]   want to kind of switch stuff around or try different frequencies or I only want
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.200]   to work on let's say weight loss then I only want to use my weight card or I
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.400]   want to work on sleeping I use my sleep card right and I don't want the
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.000]   sleep card to have like you know all sorts of different other frequencies on
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.480]   it because I just want to work with that one frequency and so I keep
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.520]   everything super organized and super you know just labeled I've got a whole
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:50.600]   video on how I do that with the idea being that I only use the quantum block
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:55.160]   when I'm copying frequencies and things like that and I don't I don't and I
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.060]   am really careful on how I get around and this is the thing how I get around
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:05.120]   putting stuff in these guys is I'll just make a copy of a card a copy the
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.760]   frequency onto a piece of foil and then I use that little piece of foil I
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:14.640]   never ever risk charging my cards overcharging my cards because of that when I
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.200]   first get them I immediately make a foil of them and then I put them away for
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.280]   like you know my my my storage and I keep them safe they're like all in
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.240]   original condition and then I use those foils and when I use the foils I'll use
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.520]   them in my super capsule or I put them in my block and then if they become
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.200]   overcharged no big deal out throw them away and then you know I'll go make a new
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.280]   one when I want to play with it again but the idea though is that you don't
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:44.200]   want to have more time on an object and if you do have more time of charging on
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.640]   an object it becomes overcharged and that you risk the copy effect so main thing
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.680]   though if you've overcharged something that has a frequency just keep it
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:57.600]   separate at least 30 inches away from your other objects so that you don't
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.320]   have that copy effect going on okay now the other thing that can actually cause
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.960]   a copy effect is if you put something in a stronger block because it's the same
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:12.120]   concept if I take something and I put it in the grand block even for three
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.680]   minutes in the grand block it's gonna be way more charged up than the original
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.760]   item that came you know like if I bought it from Layla so this is the same as if
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.160]   I would have put the object in a stronger block then it has all of a
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.360]   sudden it's got way more energy than it came out of the factory let's say with
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.960]   and it's gonna do that copy effect okay so just be aware that overcharge is not
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:38.480]   a bad thing okay if it has a frequency on it still not a bad thing you just
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:42.040]   want to avoid you know mixing up your frequencies if that's important to you
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.280]   and that's the whole thing so you know don't worry too much about leaving
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.400]   stuff in the block too long just remember that you know this is the
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.800]   concept that you're working with and it's really easy not to have to not have
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.880]   it you know mess up your stuff now the next thing I want to talk about is
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.920]   magnets now magnets come up all the time and there's you know I'm you know I
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:06.280]   the thing about magnets is is just be aware okay so be aware that the concepts
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:11.640]   of magnets having issues with quantum energy all comes down to how the blocks
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:16.800]   work okay so it doesn't affect any other device well I guess it would affect I'm
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   sorry it would affect other devices however the point being okay is that it's
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.520]   only you know going to affect it when you have a really really really strong
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.360]   rare earth magnets we're talking about new media magnets that are super powerful
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.240]   magnets okay the little weak magnets like what's in your phone or an earbud
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.680]   you know or speaker you know those are not that big of a deal because they
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:44.640]   don't produce much of a magnetic field in terms of strength okay but when you
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:50.000]   have a neomidium magnet okay and it's anywhere near let's say a block okay
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.920]   then it's going to create problems and let me explain how that basically is
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.240]   theorized okay so this right here is an illustration of the energy field of a
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.160]   block or any one of these devices and you notice how it kind of matches the
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.200]   whole concept of the bio field well that's the thing the universe creates energy
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.060]   fields in the form of what they call a toroid and this is found throughout
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.520]   the universe it's found in everything okay it's just one of those things of
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:18.200]   nature like the Fibonacci sequence in the golden mean okay you'll find this
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:23.280]   energy field in almost everything you ask people to describe you what an aura
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:28.100]   looks like it looks like this okay where the person standing in the middle so the
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.760]   whole idea though is energy is basically kind of flowing constantly flowing energy
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.240]   never stops right and so it's always flowing and it's coming through this
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.800]   you know this this big field and it's coming and it's kind of just you know
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.360]   all basically concentrated in the middle well guess what the field of a block
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.400]   looks like that's what the field of a block looks like the middle right here
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.560]   where the where the energy is most concentrated you can actually see it in
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.280]   this region it gets brightest right here it's where it's most concentrated and
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:58.560]   that's what is the block field the block field is this giant toroid of energy
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.520]   that's flowing in and out of the block and concentrated in the middle and that's
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.680]   why when you put stuff in between the plates you're in the middle of its
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:10.280]   field and that's where it's concentrated and that's why it's charging stuff okay
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.600]   so now with that in mind keep in mind so now this diagram here let me push this
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:20.040]   to the side this diagram here is a magnetic field so this is a quantum
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:25.560]   field okay so this is quantum field magnetic field let me kind of just scoot
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:31.520]   this around so kind of messed up my thing here a little bit so now here you go
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.200]   you've got this quantum field you've got this magnetic field that's what happens
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.720]   okay so now this is the description here this is what I'm trying to convey okay
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.000]   now if this is the energy field the quantum energy field life force energy
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   whatever you want to call it this is what a magnetic field looks like and you
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.760]   could see like I said I read it's it's a toroidal field you look at diagrams of
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.920]   the magnetic field of the earth right the magnetosphere guess what looks just
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:59.000]   like this except it's you know mostly it's stretched out because of the solar
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.560]   winds but either way you've got a north pole and a south pole on a really
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.240]   super strong magnet and it's got that same energy flow okay so the problem
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.680]   with magnets and blocks is if if you were to take the magnet and put it
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:17.080]   exactly inside the block it wouldn't be that problematic because it wouldn't
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:21.160]   disrupt the flow of the energy the direction of the energy okay and so I
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:25.320]   don't recommend anybody do that but why it's not recommended to put really
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.840]   super strong magnets in the block is because if you put it in if you put that
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:37.000]   magnet inside your block and it's at any other angle then perfect up and down
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.560]   north and south guess what you've got fields of energy going this way and then
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.160]   you've got your natural flow of energy right if I were just to put this in the
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:50.600]   back send that to back now all of a sudden look you've got this happening in this
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:55.640]   direction and then you've got this happening in that direction right this
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:01.600]   way versus this way and then that's what happens that is why okay it starts to
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.880]   mess with the energy field of the block that's the whole point I'm trying to
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:12.120]   make super strong magnets have super strong energy fields right that because
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.600]   of their motion if they go inside of a block it's gonna mess up the motion of
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.600]   the energy field of the block now is that a bad thing no but it is a thing and
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:28.000]   the is a thing part means that the Layla guys just haven't studied it they
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.840]   know that if you do that you put that super strong magnet in there it's gonna
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:38.040]   twist up the field of energy for the block and they're not and they haven't
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.600]   done any testing or you know trying to figure out like okay then what happens
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.280]   if you try to charge something right in the block and it's all of a sudden
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:50.840]   the energy field the energy motion is all you know gone wonky because you've
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.720]   got it pulling and stretching out of shape where it's this normal shape but
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.760]   now all of a sudden you've got other energies that are pulling and stretching
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.360]   it in different directions and it becomes basically you know it kind of
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.040]   just mutates the energy field of the block and because it does that there's
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.800]   not enough research or anybody to tell you okay well what happens to you know
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.800]   what you know like what is the effectiveness of the blocker what's
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.960]   going on in the block does the field get bigger smaller the energy is all wonky
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.000]   it's going in different directions is being stretched and pulled in different
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.080]   you know angles and it's normally functioning as a natural object and what's
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.440]   the effect of that nobody knows and that's why it's not recommended we just
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:32.080]   don't know enough we know that it's gonna mess it up right it's gonna mess
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:36.000]   with it but we don't know what the effect is and I mean nothing's gonna be
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.680]   negative you know no one's ever reported anything negative but we do know that
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.720]   when you mess with super strong magnets and you mess that with you you start
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:48.920]   messing around with magnets and you start messing around with energy devices
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:53.360]   and it can be any kind of energy device even your crystals okay keep in mind
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:58.320]   your crystals put out energy you put out energy you would never want to have
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.200]   one of these strong magnets around you because it's gonna mess up your bio
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:07.000]   field okay so this is the natural field of everything so really really really
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.320]   caution on super strong magnets because they will warp your field or whatever
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.640]   you're working with and there's not enough understanding as to like what
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:19.480]   the effect of that is you know and and is every and is everything gonna work
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:24.360]   the way it's supposed to when that happens probably not that's why it's
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:29.720]   recommended do not put super strong magnets in or near your blocks and or
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.800]   yourself or any of your other Layla devices okay because they mess up the
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:39.480]   field there enough of that okay the next one here is placing photos and blocks
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.400]   okay now there's a lot of questions about and this is a quantum healing thing
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.240]   right but placing photos and blocks what's that all about well it's quantum
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:51.480]   entanglement and anytime you do that and it's this is real actual quantum physics
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:55.240]   guys they've actually proven science has proven it there was a Nobel Prize last
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.480]   year for a couple of scientists that actually prove the concept of quantum
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.400]   entanglement between two you know electrons or something and so the whole
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.800]   idea here is that you know you can pass energy from one
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:11.080]   you know from one part of a person to another part of that same person
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:16.120]   and a picture a picture of you is that a sample of your DNA like a piece you
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:21.560]   know a clock of hair or drip of blood you know or or cells right from you it
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.400]   gonna tie to you so there you are in two places at once in other in other words
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.840]   right and so even a picture can do it even writing your name on a piece of
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:34.280]   paper can do it so you can basically identify the other part right you know
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:38.120]   particle A and particle B this would be particle A and particle B in physics
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.720]   right or in quantum entanglement the photo ties
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:46.680]   to you it is you in the quantum universe okay so if you take that photo of you
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:51.080]   pet whatever house tree and you put it inside the block
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:55.320]   then the energy of this block is going to go into that photo find you in the
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.160]   universe through quantum entanglement and then it's actually going to get to you
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:03.480]   alright and that's how it works and so here's just an example of me helping
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:09.560]   somebody that somebody I forgot who was I get asked a lot to help out so I do
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.680]   so I just you know print out a photo and then this person actually had the
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:17.000]   heal frequency with them but this is kind of what you do you just
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.280]   basically put the photo in the block okay and then this is what happens that
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.440]   energy finds goes through the quantum universe and finds that person
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:29.080]   and then sends them that energy right or and or sends with the frequency that
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.960]   you're sending them like the heal frequency you know or someone's going
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.920]   through some really tough time you send them the inner peace frequency
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.520]   whatever you want you know you can just send it frequency send energy
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.760]   to anybody anywhere anytime and and also pets and trees
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:47.880]   I've actually got the banyan tree from lina a Maui in my grand block it's been
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:51.880]   in there for since the fire and you know I'm just sending energy to that tree to
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:56.040]   help it to help it heal and it's been a couple months now
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.240]   and so it's still there you know so I've got a photo of the banyan tree in my
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.680]   grand block right now so but but that's how it works now the
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.880]   thing about placing photos and blocks okay if you want to use
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.480]   this feature of your quantum devices and blocks are the only thing that do it
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:13.960]   now is is you only want to do one person at a time
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.080]   and that's one of them big recommends okay and the reason you don't want to do
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:22.360]   two is because if you put two in here right you co-mingle the two people
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:26.040]   together and now they may not want to be co-mingled
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.920]   together their energy fields right you start mixing up their bio energy
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:32.440]   fields and guess what you start mixing up all of the stuff that's stuck in
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.800]   their bio energy field right do you really want to be doing that to
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.960]   somebody so the whole idea here is only one person at a time
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:43.160]   because you don't want to mix them together and that's what's going to
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.480]   happen is they're going to be mixed together if you put them in there
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.400]   together from a quantum energy state okay
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.480]   so one person at a time the photo has to be recognizable in other words if you
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.120]   look at the photo and go yeah you know that's that person
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:00.520]   yeah if it's so far away or it's only like from behind
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:04.680]   or it's just like a body part you know it may not be recognizable
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.840]   but it needs to be recognizable and keep in mind too that your intentions
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:12.200]   you know i made a video the other day called the science of intention and i
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:16.680]   talked about a actual quantum physics things called the observer
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:20.040]   effect yeah whenever you are doing anything
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.680]   it doesn't matter if you're doing stuff with quantum
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:26.120]   you what you're thinking how you're feeling what's going on in your mind
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:31.240]   right is projecting to through your your actions and so your intentions
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.400]   while you're doing this are super important
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:38.680]   okay so from the concept of recognizable what i mean by that is if you put in
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.320]   a picture of let's say your mom heard her knee
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.120]   and you just put that photo in there but you're not focused you know
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.040]   you have to set the intention that that is your mom's knee
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.680]   or the quantum space is not going to find it they're just not going to know
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:53.800]   who's knee that is so you have to use your intentions while you're doing
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:58.120]   this and make sure that the intention is like oh this is mom's knee
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.480]   please you know send send you know positive energy and healing
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:05.000]   frequency to my mother here you go put the photo in
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.840]   you've now set that observer effect you put that that intention into the
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.320]   universe into the block and boom going to go find your mom's
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.840]   knee okay so you definitely have to be recognizable
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:18.280]   and if not make sure you're using intentions
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.360]   and then there's also people going hey can i put a digital photo in can i just
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:26.120]   have a photo on my cell phone and put my cell phone in the block right and use
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.840]   that photo on my phone yeah that works because it's still
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.720]   recognizable right it's on the phone so but here's
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:35.720]   a thing though everything about your phone is also going to be sent along
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.240]   you know i mean so you've got you know the frequency of the phone
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.760]   and and everything you've put into that phone you know if you understand
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.280]   objects carry you know this thing right here well there's a little
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.320]   little little memories that kind of float and get stuck in you
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.800]   yeah everything anything you touch anything you touch
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.400]   there's parts of you left in it okay and all that stuff's going to be on that
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:02.680]   phone and so that's kind of be you know it's going to get transferred over as
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.480]   well so i don't recommend using cell phone photos
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:09.400]   i always just print them out um so yeah be aware of that
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:13.160]   and then the idea here of duration you know how long should i leave a photo in
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.960]   well it's completely intuitive there's no guideline for that
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.440]   bottom line is you you basically are sending healing energy and frequencies
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:25.320]   to someone to help them for something right and so you know i would send it in
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.080]   until it helps them sometimes like i said i just left a tree and for i don't know
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.880]   two months now i put myself in the block for weeks at
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:35.880]   a time i've done that with when my daughter gets sick i'll put her photo in
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.560]   the block uh and stuff like that so it's just a matter of
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.480]   intuition and i put it in there and then check with them and see how it's going
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.000]   and leave it in there as long as you feel i mean what your intuitive
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.080]   intuitive sense is telling you is long enough or you know or
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.920]   not long enough okay so it's all about intuition so just follow
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:58.440]   what you feel is the right thing to do in terms of how long
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:02.120]   to leave a photo in the block now i did talk about their frequencies again
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:05.880]   frequencies will carry with it so you can definitely use frequencies
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.880]   when you're putting in photos uh and also permission now that that's the last
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:13.320]   piece about putting photos in the block is do i need permission
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.360]   well yeah you do because if the other person isn't participating in their
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.520]   own healing um then right off the bat uh you know
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:28.120]   it's your sending energy to someone who by their own ability right to create
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.040]   and manifest their in reality uh if they don't believe this stuff
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:35.400]   works right off the bat nothing's going to happen because they are putting up
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:39.240]   this shield this wall of you know not believing and because they don't
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:41.960]   believe it's not gonna nothing's going to work it's going to stop it
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.800]   uh but if they're not participating like oh someone's feeling really low
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.440]   they're going through divorce or whatever i'm going to send them some
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:52.440]   quantum energy well you might want to ask them is that something that they want
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.240]   and if they're participating yeah they're accepting it and so when you
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.520]   accept it and guys this is just how it works right
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.720]   if they're accepting and they're participating in the process
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:05.000]   then better results are going to happen now what do you say about oh
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.840]   grandpa's in a coma right or so-and-so is unconscious or they can't
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.440]   speak for themselves pets right well yeah you can still send them
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:18.920]   energy okay just remember though um that you know
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.600]   using your intentions if they can't speak for themselves
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.800]   then use your intentions but always ask through your intentions
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.640]   in other words how i do it is let's say uh how i do it
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.280]   is is i kind of throw in the whole divine plan thing
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.400]   where it's like hey you know i'm sending energy to this person
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:40.280]   or this pet you know um you know please uh you know just my my thinking on my
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.360]   feelings how i send intentions is you know help help this individual
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:49.080]   heal um you know and and recover faster or feel better
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:52.120]   and i will put that out there you know and then i always say
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:55.640]   you know according to their to their own wishes and their their own divine
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.760]   plan and their divine plan is whatever you know the
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:03.480]   vinity or their own karma has set out for them so that that way my intentions
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:08.040]   align with all of that right and and especially you know if they you know
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.840]   and if they you know if they accept it i think that's what i'm trying to say
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.880]   is if they can't speak for themselves and none of your pets can
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.200]   then just send them that positive energy and just set the intention that you know
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.920]   that uh you know that they're willing to accept it
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.160]   and if they accept it let this help help them
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.800]   you know and let it align with their divine plan
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.840]   because sometimes it just might be their time to pass right
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.440]   and you're not going to affect that other times you know they might be
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.160]   trying to fight the live right you know you know the difference right
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.240]   if they're fighting to struggle and they're fighting to live then he'll you
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.360]   know to help this you know how this energy might the intention is
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.560]   have this energy help them support them and help them heal
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.520]   help them survive and that sort of thing so i'm trying to help i'm trying to
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.800]   be clear on that but that's the whole idea about permissions okay
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.720]   now the last piece here i want to cover is upgrading your blocks
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.920]   now you know now that there's more than you know more than one block you know
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.640]   we all started out right i've been here from the beginning we started with one
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.120]   block now there's four blocks and so there's
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:06.200]   some confusion here about hey i want to upgrade my block upgrade meaning i want
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:11.240]   to increase the strength of it and so here is the idea here that i wanted
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.480]   to kind of clarify if you've got more than one block and you want to
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:20.360]   make the weaker one stronger you know no problem there i mean you don't have to
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.480]   right but if you want to then you know by all means
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:27.160]   so here i talked to phillip yesterday and i wanted and i put together this chart
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.040]   with them just to make sure that everybody's really clear on how to
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.640]   upgrade your block okay so let's start off with these are the blocks right
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.400]   here and then these are what you would upgrade it with
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:41.320]   okay so you upgrade with this site so now quantum block no don't touch it
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.840]   don't mess with it that's the general the guideline for
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.960]   messing with a quantum block is you don't mess with it
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   don't try to upgrade it don't try to you know don't do anything to it
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:56.200]   it's literally the most special block you know i realize everyone's you know
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.080]   they're always gravitating towards the biggest best they're gonna blah blah
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.880]   then the actual quantum block because it can't overcharge
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.480]   it's it's it's the most special block so don't mess with it
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.160]   just please don't touch with that just don't don't change it okay
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.840]   because you don't realize until you get into doing frequency things
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:18.680]   how critically important how valuable it is to have something that doesn't
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.800]   overcharge and so that's the quantum is a very
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.440]   special block now if you have a travel block
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.320]   then the idea here is you know first of all you need you don't mess with the
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:31.800]   quantum block you don't ever ever don't ever put these big strong blocks
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.080]   in a quantum block or near one just keep them away from each other 30 inches
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:38.920]   minimum okay so but if you have a travel block
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:43.320]   can you upgrade travel block with another one no you can't do that
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:47.480]   with any of them so the travel blocks cannot upgrade any of the other blocks
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.160]   okay according to philip because they're just not designed to it's not
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.600]   designed to upgrade each other it's stronger than the
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:59.800]   it's okay then it's you can't upgrade an infinity block with a travel block
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:04.760]   it's just not recommended okay because they're kind of close in energy size
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.600]   but energy strength but you can grow an infinity block
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.280]   stronger and stronger and stronger so there's really no idea of like what
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.320]   infinity block are you trying to charge with a travel block
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.400]   so just don't do it but if you wanted to upgrade your travel block and you have
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.040]   a grand block you know someone who does no does
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.680]   then this is the night i do apologize i think i posted a couple weeks ago
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.320]   somebody asked me this and i said i'll just do it for 20 minutes it's kind of a
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:33.160]   gray area i'm not really sure so now i am sure i talk to philip
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.640]   and he said yeah take the rods off put all six
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.080]   play or put all two plates and the travel block and just put them in the ground
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.720]   block for 45 minutes and then what you will have is you'll have a grand block
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.560]   strength travel block okay so yeah you can definitely upgrade a travel block
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:51.640]   using a grand uh don't mess don't don't take a travel and put it in an
[00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:55.160]   infinity uh because the travel block is stronger
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.800]   than the infinity okay you'll mess up your infinity block
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.760]   and no you can't upgrade a travel block with another travel block
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:05.240]   it's not designed for that okay so no no for you and only do it in a grand
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:09.720]   now if you have an infinity block okay those were actually designed to upgrade
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.840]   each other so if you got the infinity block package and i do
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.480]   then you can go back and forth there's a video for that
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.520]   and kind of just do it this little step by step by step and you're kind of just
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:22.840]   seesawing your way up this scale of having different generations of blocks
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.880]   of infinity blocks and that's 45 minutes take the rods off
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.840]   put all six plates in the infinity block of the other one
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.440]   and you can go ahead and upgrade your infinity block to infinity
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.320]   all right so that's that now if you don't have a second infinity
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.520]   and you wouldn't got a grand block no problem take the rods off put the plates
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.960]   in there and you put it in your grand block but you only can do that one time
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:47.320]   so then you will now have a infinity block that's got the strength of a
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.480]   grand block if you do this okay one time so it's only going to be a one time
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.800]   upgrade but if you have the second infinity it's an
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.520]   you can and you can grow it to infinity if you want
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.720]   but just one thing about the grand block you should be aware of right that
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.720]   in ib-10 so even if you had an infinity block and you got it up to 10
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.360]   it's still not as strong as a grand block according to phil
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.880]   okay so you could definitely you could definitely you know jump the gun and
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.640]   just go straight to something over 10 and then but it
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.000]   only be that one time and then once you have it
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.360]   people ask me well what if i got another infinity block could i take that or
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.360]   grand block infinity block and stick it in and regular infinity block no
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.520]   no no no because now it's so much stronger than the infinity block
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.880]   you're going to mess up the other infinity blocks so just
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:36.040]   you know it's funny but this comes up right it's complicated
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.800]   but that's why philip and i talked about it and i said hey i need some guidance
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.720]   so i can share it with everybody so bottom line is if you only if you
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:48.360]   grand block your infinity block it's a one-time thing don't and then at that
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.160]   point now you've basically got an infinity block
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.280]   that's as strong as a grand you're done don't mess with it anymore
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.400]   now if i take a grand block can i upgrade it with any of the other blocks
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.880]   no no no no you just can't it is the strongest block
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.400]   um and it's it's you just can't upgrade it you can't they're not designed to
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.840]   upgrade each other um and you've got the strongest block
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.960]   and that's that's where you're at you just there's no there's no upgrading
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.520]   and grand with anything else okay there's nothing that can
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:19.320]   upgrade it even itself cannot upgrade it okay with that said so
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.360]   uh so that's really kind of important to know about upgrading your blocks
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:26.200]   okay that's it so hopefully this was helpful i'm just trying to you know
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.920]   these are all the questions i answer all the time
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:31.320]   so that's why i made this video i'm hoping that it'll be helpful for you
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.760]   guys and then i will be able to have a reference whenever i get these
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.640]   questions again um and if you guys have other kinds of
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.040]   questions like this uh you know just let me know
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:43.240]   uh and i'll just do another one of these but bottom line though hey thanks a lot
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:46.200]   for watching appreciate your time you can always reach out
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:50.200]   to me on the tinker's academy blog and or lay the quantum tech in the telegram
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.160]   check group links below in the video description
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.200]   hope uh hope this was helpful and you know have a great day guys
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.160]   talk to you later
