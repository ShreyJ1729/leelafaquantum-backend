[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   Aloha, everyone, and welcome to another Tinker's Academy video. I'm your host,
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.800]   Keelmer, and this video is a further installment in the video series. Welcome to Layla Q,
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.520]   otherwise known as Layla Quantum Tech, where I've been putting together videos on
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.400]   all of the various frequently asked questions that are received in the Telegram support group
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.160]   for Layla Quantum Tech and Quantum Upgrade. This video in particular is on the topic of
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.880]   why don't I feel anything? And that relates to the types of people who try the product,
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.240]   you know, get a capsule or a block or subscribe to Quantum Upgrade, and they just don't feel
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.080]   anything. Whereas if you go into those chat groups, you'll see posts after posts. I mean,
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.680]   there's just so many people who are reporting incredible benefits and feeling it and all this
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.560]   other stuff. And I truly empathize and understand there's other people out there that they're like,
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.520]   hey, I don't feel anything. And I'm kind of in both camps personally. Sometimes I feel it,
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.760]   sometimes I don't. So I kind of been chewing on the like, what's the appropriate response to that
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.640]   question? And you know, and what's the background that supports it? So one of the first things I
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.000]   really kind of want to share with you is just sort of a reality check. Okay, so when I looked at the
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.120]   possible reasons why people are not there, some people are not feeling anything, it kind of breaks
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.600]   down into like, you know, hey, you know, are there chakras block because they don't have any energy
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.320]   flow? So they don't, they're not sensitive to energy. You know, and there's the concept of,
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.200]   you know, stuck in thinking brain versus feeling brain. Also too, you know, it's our, this is all
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.600]   about having a very good develop six cents. And our people out there just, they just don't,
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.520]   they're just, you know, they just don't feel anything outside of their five senses. And obviously,
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.080]   too, there's the concept of vibration, you know, we'll have our own vibration. And if you're kind
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.000]   of like stuck in the lower ones, you know, it's hard for you to feel the higher ones, you know,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.160]   so I kind of like, let's, let's talk about that a little bit. Now, the first thing I want to address
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.600]   is the science and the reality check of the science aspect of the, of this question, you know, why
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.040]   don't I feel anything? Well, you know, if you actually listed out the results from the 60 plus
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.000]   studies that have been done by these third party individual scientists and clinicians that Leila
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.560]   Quantum Tech has commissioned, you know, it's all third party. It's not their own employees. It's
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.720]   not their people, but they go and they hire clinics and universities and institutes. And they do all
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.280]   these studies on quantum upgrade and devices. And then they have, and then there's these studies
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.000]   come back and they're all on the websites. It's all third party double blind placebo. I mean,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.600]   it's literally the gold standard of doing scientific studies. And there's well over 60 of them. So
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.480]   when you look at the results of all of these scientific studies saying, hey, this is what happens to
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.040]   cells, this is what happens to blood. This is what happens to, you know, XYZ heart rate variability,
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.120]   you know, you name it, you know, and, you know, all that stuff you see on the list here on the
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.800]   right side of the screen. So you've got this list. So here's the reality check that I'm talking about
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.080]   like increased ATP production, increased white blood cell count, expedites wound healing,
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.040]   improves oxygen to nation blood, you know, decreases blood clotting, decreases parasitic
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.880]   load, et cetera. Well, what does that feel like? And honestly, physically, you're not, you're not
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.160]   going to feel something at the cellular level of your body. You might feel it if you turn it off.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.320]   But if it's happening inside of you, I mean, it's kind of like taking a vitamin, you know,
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.040]   like it's like that funny thing about Amazon. If you know, if you've ever bought a vitamin on
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.320]   Amazon and then Amazon will send you a request to review it. And every time I get that, I just
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.440]   look at this request like, well, what am I going to say? You know, I take vitamin C. So, you know,
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.800]   does it move the dial? Do I feel it? No, I don't feel anything. But I do feel it if I stop taking
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.320]   it for long periods of time. So, you know, so, but the idea of like, how do I review or, you know,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.520]   I don't feel anything when I take the vitamins, you know, but I definitely feel it if I don't.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.840]   And that's one of the little, little secrets I want to share with you that a lot of times,
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.560]   you know, this is happening at such a subtle level, this meaning, you know, your exposure to quantum
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.680]   energy that sometimes, honestly, if you don't feel anything, hey, we'll turn everything off for a
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.520]   while, then look back and go, wow, is there anything different between not having it and having it?
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.760]   And most likely, in a lot of cases for me personally, that's when I'll go, oh, yeah, I actually
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.840]   noticed difference. Things were better. Things were easier. Things flowed smoother. I felt better,
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.400]   et cetera. When I had it on, I just didn't really notice because it's so subtle. And that's kind
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.840]   of the point I'm trying to make here about the science behind quantum energy is that there is
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.880]   so much happening at a cellular level. And, you know, so what is that supposed to feel like? And
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.280]   the answer is nothing. You don't feel it. And that's just sort of the way it is. The one thing that
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.320]   people really, really, really do feel though, and this comes up a lot is, you know, take a look at
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.280]   what the posts are in the telegram chat group about people who are tinkering around with the blocks
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.640]   on testing on their food intolerances. You know, they're not quote feeling anything, but they
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:11.120]   certainly as heck are noticing it when they can now, after putting stuff in a block, they now can
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.920]   tolerate gluten and, you know, whatever, people that's all up and down. There's people, you know,
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.440]   allergic to citrus. And I'm personally, I'm very sensitive to MSG. I've done the experiment on
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.280]   myself. You will definitely notice you don't quote feel anything, but you will notice that it's
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.800]   doing something. And I think that's, you know, honestly, what it all boils down to, you know,
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.000]   is this doing something? I paid for this. I had this expectation. I don't feel anything and I'm
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.920]   disappointed. Well, honestly, at the science cellular level, all that stuff is happening.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:49.280]   It's been proven. You're just not going to feel it. So now let's say, if you want to feel it,
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.720]   I totally empathize with that. I'm the same boat. So one of the things I did do is I reached out to
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.840]   Phillip, my good friend, who is owner, operator of Layla Quantum Tech, if you don't know that already.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.480]   And I asked him, you know, I said, Hey, you know, because we had this one post a little while ago,
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.440]   where, you know, someone was kind of just, you know, theorizing is like, could I not be feeling it
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.440]   because, you know, my chakras were blocked, you know, someone I worked with, you know, an energy
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.240]   worker told me I had blocked chakras. So I reached out to Phillip and I said, Hey, Phillip,
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.120]   you know, I'm kind of would, you know, I wanted to add this question to the video series. Welcome to
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.000]   Layla Q. I wanted to address it. And I asked him, Hey, what do you think about that comment? You know,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.920]   like, you know, could it be that, you know, a person's chakras are blocked? And that's why they're
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.800]   not feeling the energy? Or, you know, could it be something else? So Phillip kind of gave me a sound
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.880]   bite to answer that question. And I just wanted to share it with you so that we can kind of just
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.480]   get an idea, you know, from our, you know, our pretty much our subject matter expert on quantum
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.560]   energy as to what he thought. And what his answer was to that question. So here we go.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.200]   It's a, it's a big question. So there's a lot of reasons why people can't feel anything. And
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.840]   one thing is just because they're so used to just using their brain, they can't even feel
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:08.800]   themselves. And one of many reasons could be that the chakras are completely blocked.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.080]   Another reason is they're just literally all the time in their brain. That's what they're used to.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.920]   They're thinking they're thinking they're observing everything. They're completely rational.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.760]   They can't get really into feeling. And from that, from actually feeling and noticing your five senses
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:33.360]   in a really a worse state, the next level is to actually then perceive things like energy. So,
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:41.920]   so to be honest, I don't think there's anything we can do with these people other than that we can
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:49.680]   tell them that the products and or the the quantum upgrade actually help with them
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:56.800]   getting more in touch and in tune with themselves, which happens over time. And they can accelerate
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:04.480]   that process by doing certain practices or exercising certain practices, right? And that
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:10.960]   there's a bunch available that are that are for free, right? I've mentioned it many times in the
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:19.600]   podcast where you know, just people should take a minute every morning and every evening or night
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:26.160]   in their bed. As the last and the first thing they do after or before the cell phone is off to
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.000]   just ask themselves the question, how do I feel? And they don't have to answer. They need to listen.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.400]   They need to really stay with it, even if it's uncomfortable for people. And they should do that
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:45.840]   for at least two weeks. Already after a week, they will see a significant shift. And so if they use
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:51.760]   the technology during that time, the shift will be even greater. If they start doing yoga, if they
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:59.760]   start doing Tai Chi meditation, those are all things that help to get more in tune with themselves
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.920]   and the technology helps. If they have a technology, then they can start doing things like charging
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:12.560]   one glass of water and the other one they don't. And then they do the taste test where they look at
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:21.840]   it and try to see if the energy feels different. Things like that, just practicing that muscle.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:28.720]   That is what people should be doing. And there's no magic bullet.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:37.920]   You know, I mean, if people participate in a webinar, for example, we can significantly
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.720]   amp up certain receptors and stuff like that for an individual. But honestly,
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:52.720]   we can't do that with just some people that are there and say they don't feel anything.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:04.240]   Right. So I hope that helps. But it's definitely related mainly for because they have not used
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:11.920]   that muscle yet. And they should be training it somehow.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:22.320]   So as a side note, we've been working on this certified quantum wellness practitioner,
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.480]   something like that, I think it's going to be called. And I hope we can release it
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:37.520]   in the last quarter of this year. That would be, that is a course that's great for advanced
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:46.720]   users of the tech. But it's also great for any newbie, basically, because it helps them a little
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:53.440]   further with getting into this with some there's some energy perception exercises in there and
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:11:01.360]   stuff like that. I know it doesn't help now. And and it's been a forever topic. It's just taken
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:09.600]   forever. But but the light is at the end of the tunnel. And it's it's supposed to be released,
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:17.920]   you know, hopefully, yeah, I'm pretty certain it'll be in two four. Well, that's exciting. So
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:24.400]   by Q four, hopefully Layla will have a kind of like a course that can help people with energy
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.800]   perception. I think that's really an exciting announcement. But at the same time, you know,
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:34.080]   just to kind of recap what Phillip was saying was that, you know, is that we have six senses and
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:40.240]   like anything else about ourselves, our, you know, our physical form, which includes our sense,
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.600]   our sixth sense, which is consciousness, you know, it's basically something that we develop.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.120]   And the thing that I want to kind of really convey to, you know, some, some of you seriously
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.480]   left brain people, and I'm one of you. So, you know, I walked into all of this being very science
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:02.480]   oriented. And it's taken a lot to convince me, you know, and to become the supporter that I've
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.280]   become a little quantum tech. But the idea though, and I just want to really stipulate that is our
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:14.480]   six senses to really fine tune any of them requires practice. And it's just like any other muscle,
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.880]   you know, even like your brain, you know, they always talk about how older people should be doing
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:24.320]   puzzles and should be active and engaged in reading and not just sit on the couch and watch TV if
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.800]   they stop using their brains. I mean, it doesn't matter what age you are, but if you just stop
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.920]   using your brain, and you just sit there and be a Luddite and just scroll on your phone all day,
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:40.560]   your brain is going to turn to mush, you have to exercise, you have to engage and participate and
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.280]   practice. And that's really the message that I wanted to convey and Philip gave out some great
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:50.320]   examples. I'll kind of go over a list here in a second, but I do want to mention the importance
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:57.040]   though of really trying to understand that a you do have a sixth sense, all of us have that sixth
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.760]   sense. And you can call it whether there's so many different names for it. There's empathy and
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:07.120]   clairvoyance and consciousness and extra sensory perception, you know, ESP, but there's all these
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.080]   different labels, but for the same thing, and that we have the ability to do that. And that's
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:17.200]   demonstrated in multiple different ways through multiple different sources. So the first thing
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.760]   about anyone who would think that, Oh, you know, that's not really real. You know, we're not supposed
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.840]   to be able to feel energy and all that like, No, actually, you should take a look at the the
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:31.280]   look at the science. And if you go into the science of the sixth sense, there's actually been documented
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.680]   and proven that there exists something in the end, you know, that the psychologist like to call it
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:41.360]   intuition, which is just another name for it. You know, and then there's this huge thing about
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.680]   that they've proven inter intuition and they call it pattern, pattern matching, you know,
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.800]   in the science world pattern matching. And one of the things that's interesting too,
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.760]   is that scientists will call, they call it highway hypnosis. There's this thing where, and we've all
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.120]   done it, where have you ever noticed that if you don't pay attention to your driving,
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.040]   you end up driving home, you just do it. And you don't remember how you drove home. You don't
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.760]   remember driving home, but you drove home. And it's kind of it's called highway hypnosis. It's when
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.880]   your consciousness just kicks in and gives you a break and takes over for you. And that's actually
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:16.480]   documented in the annals of psychology. So there's this concept of, you know, intuition and all of
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:23.040]   that that I just mentioned, that just acts it, you know, actually, and unequivocally defines the
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.000]   reality that we have a sixth sense. And then there's all of this other stuff that says, yeah,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.320]   you could really fine tune that. So if you don't feel anything, then most likely, and you know,
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.520]   least likely are your chakras are blocked, but they could be, you know, work with an energy. But
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.320]   I wouldn't work on that. That would not be the first thing I think about. The first thing I would
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:50.320]   think about, if I couldn't feel anything, and this is what I did, was I would start working on my
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:57.520]   consciousness, my intuition, I would start working on that sixth sense, and try to grow that and
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:03.200]   make that even stronger. So just to kind of reiterate what Philip was saying in his, in his video clip
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.560]   was that, hey, you know, that meditation. And so meditation is one of the number one ways,
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.600]   if you want to enhance your sixth sense, if you're not feeling anything, and I kind of hopefully
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:20.400]   have laid out an argument that you can, if you wanted to, you can, it's just a matter of practice
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:26.160]   and exercise. And one of the best ways to do that is through meditation. Philip is an actual
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:33.280]   Kundalini teacher and one of his numerous different things that he does. And so Kundalini is a form
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:40.000]   of meditation that he that he that he does himself. Chikong is another one or key, key Kong.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.760]   There's different ways Chinese pronounce it key that her chi and the Japanese pronounce it key,
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:52.400]   but either way, there's this mind body exercise that's the predecessor of all martial arts. All
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:58.000]   martial arts start out with Chikong. And if you actually study the history of it, they don't even
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   know how far back Chikong goes, but all martial arts came from this. And this and the very first
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.520]   thing you learn in martial arts is to control your chi, which is your life force energy, which in
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:15.040]   the Leila world is called quantum energy. So if you study this, and actually, the reason I was
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.680]   very open to this, even though I'm science minded in the beginning, was that I had actually had the
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:26.000]   opportunity as a young man to study Chikong at a Taoist monastery for a year, where I lived. And
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:33.040]   for a whole year, I studied under Taoist monks and priests, the art of Chikong, you know, and also
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.680]   that studied other martial arts as well. But that was the one I wanted to try. It's like, you know,
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.880]   and cheat, Tai Chi would be a different form. But once you learn that, and anyone who's done martial
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.280]   arts, there's no question about the idea of being able to feel energy, you can feel your cheat,
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.320]   right? But but that is one incredibly exceptional way to learn it. And you know, just as a just as
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:58.960]   an, you know, a note, I actually went, you know, I recently had moved to where I live now. And as
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:04.000]   I was making this video, I was thinking, wow, is there like a Chikong group here in my town? And
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.280]   it's a small town is a college countdown. And I certainly I found I found a website. And there's
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.160]   this group that meets in the park twice a week by my house. And it's free. Just join them. And
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.800]   they just do Chikong together. So I mean, I'm telling you that you can go and find these resources
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.080]   anywhere. And you can find some of them for free. So, you know, I recommend and highly, you know,
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:28.960]   recommend, you know, take up Chikong. It's it's really healthy for you on top of that. But it's a
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:34.080]   great way to get in touch with your chi with the chi of nature and to be able to, you know, work
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:39.360]   on that and not tell you will feel it. The other way is just mantras. There's this is an age old
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.160]   practice of chanting mantras to get in touch with your consciousness and just start to be able to
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:50.400]   feel energy and basically manipulate energy. That's also through sound healing. I mean, sounds
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:56.560]   enchanting predate anything else on the historical record and ancient mythologies. And it's just
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.520]   the sounds, you know, like all the bells in all the churches and the old days and all that this
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.360]   and just the humming and the chanting and all of that stuff came from the ancients. And they knew
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.160]   how to use sound to elevate their consciousness. And that's just something we haven't inherited.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.720]   And there's a lot of really great sound healing teachers out there who can then, you know, then
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:20.560]   basically teach you how to work with sound and frequency. And that then will also elevate your
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.040]   consciousness to the point where you're feeling energy. Now, there's another one that I do all
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.560]   the time and I do this as much as I can. And that's called shiranyoku. And that's the Japanese
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:37.600]   practice of forest bathing. And I mentioned this because it is my favorite of all things to do.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.440]   You know, it's not necessarily meditation, but you get out there in the forest and you become
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:49.120]   one with the forest. Okay. And I mean that in seriousness, you know, and it sounds really
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.960]   hippy. But I'm telling you, if you go in and immerse yourself in nature, especially forests,
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:01.120]   because of all the trees, there's this incredible life force energy thing going on between the trees.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:06.720]   And when you walk into that bio field of all that life in you and train with it, there's this
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.320]   whole thing to it. So there's actually a book out there called shiranyoku. It's in the American
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.640]   translation or US English translation is called forest bathing. You know, and that is something
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:22.400]   that, you know, immersing yourself in forests is probably one of the best ways to raise your
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:28.080]   consciousness and raise your ability to feel that energy. And I actually do when I walk into a forest,
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.680]   I can feel the forest. I've been doing this for well over 20 years. And so now tapping is another
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:39.280]   one. Now tapping is a practice of tapping on your meridian points of your electric acupuncture
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:45.200]   meridians. And that's also another way to, you know, to increase your ability to, well, first of all,
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:51.040]   it frees up that blocked energy. So if you have blocked energy, then tapping is a great way
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.360]   to free up that energy. And then also when you free it up, you start to be able to feel it and
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:00.320]   it flows and all of that. And the other one too is just straight up old simple ESP training.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:05.120]   You know, you can sign up for ESP training in a bunch of different places, where you can actually
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:10.560]   learn to, you know, enhancer, you know, you know, ESP your psychic abilities. And that's again,
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.280]   another elevated form of consciousness that can then kind of fine tune your ability to feel
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.080]   that around you that you don't see with your eyes, you can't feel with your hands. But ESP
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.160]   training is really out there. And you know, for you guys that don't know, I mean, you know,
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:30.560]   all of this stuff is so serious that, you know, the US military is really deep into this. And you
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.760]   may not know, but there's this guy who wrote a book or he wrote several books about it is Dr.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:44.560]   Richard Allen Miller. And he wrote books about his time in the 60s, where he was hired to train
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:51.440]   and develop the program for the US Navy Seals to fine tune their intuition for the work that they
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:57.200]   do, you know, and basically he did that and he's the he's the founder of that program. And, you know,
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:03.120]   and the program is part of the Navy Seals programming for, you know, basically how to be a super soldier
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.680]   by fine tuning your intuition so that when you're in the heat of battle, and you need to go left or
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:13.120]   right, you just tune into your intuition and choose the appropriate path, you know. And so
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.640]   that's just one of those things that I mean, even the military's really, you know, very conscious and
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:24.880]   and they're very aware of the incredible power of your sixth sense. So those are some of the ways
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.320]   you can, you know, really kind of fine tune it and help you if you know, if you really want to take
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.440]   this to that level for yourself, where you want to be able to feel that energy, then this is how,
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.800]   you know, work on developing your sixth sense. Now, the other thing I do want to kind of put in here
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.800]   that, you know, that it really does need to be mentioned to is like, where do you know, where do
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.120]   you vibrate? You know, what's your vibration? And you know, I realize, you know, like, everybody
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.600]   has a vibe, places have a vibe, and you know, it's kind of like that old, you know, hippie thing,
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.520]   you know, like everybody's, you know, hey, you're vibing, but you know what, it's so true. The hippies
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.480]   were right. You know, but we do have a vibration. And you know, in a lot of times, Laila Quantum
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.880]   Tech uses the Hocken scale of consciousness. I've stripped the numbers out because the numbers
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.040]   don't mean anything to me. But here's the concept that I want to convey to you is that we all have
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:16.880]   a range. We all live within a range that we've basically have trained ourselves to be able to,
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.520]   how do you deal with life, you know, and what's your range? And you can see where the bottom,
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.920]   you know, the alpha to the omega, you know, on the Hocken scale of consciousness goes from the
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.560]   feeling of shame all the way to the feeling of enlightenment as you raise your vibration,
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.680]   and you live in a different mode, you live in a different range of existence in terms of
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.480]   consciousness and emotion. And so, you know, every goes from guilt, shame, apathy, grief, fear,
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.840]   despair, all the way up into love and joy and peace. And we all live within a range. I mean,
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.600]   there's some people that just are stuck down here and they live in the, you know, like, you know,
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.440]   because nobody lives at a certain line. And that's the thing I really want to point out that nobody
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.040]   just lives in the world of acceptance, you know, everybody has a range. We all have good days,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.040]   we all have bad days, you know, and so the whole idea is like, what's your lowest low and your
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.960]   highest high? Like, if you're highest high, the last time you felt your highest high was you felt
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:14.240]   neutrality, you know, there's so much more higher you could go. And you're if what's your lowest low,
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.160]   this lowest low is you get a little angry when driving in traffic. That's pretty awesome. You
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.400]   got a pretty short range. But the idea for elevating your consciousness or elevating your
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:28.880]   vibration is to how can you raise that range so that your lowest low is neutrality and your highest,
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:33.680]   highest peace and joy and love. You know, that's the ultimate conquest. That's the ultimate
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:38.000]   desire for all of us that are seeking higher consciousness is to actually get into that omega,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.160]   get into that ultimate consciousness, you know, but the bottom line is that none of us are ever
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.960]   going to be separated from the, from the reality that we get angry every now and then. I mean,
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.200]   even the greatest gurus of our time, you know, like Buddha and Confucius and all those guys,
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.880]   you know, hey, you know, would they have been the same people that they are if they had to drive in
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:00.080]   traffic, sit in a cube for eight hours a day and then raise toddlers or even worse, a teenage girl,
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.520]   you know, have a teenage daughter, can you imagine Buddha with a teenage daughter like how
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:08.720]   what his range would have been? Here he's up, he's, you know, he's floating around in ultimate
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.560]   consciousness. And it long comes his teenage daughter and damn, he's over here and like,
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.760]   guilt, shame, he's angry. But that's the point I try to make, you know, it's like, we're all
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.920]   different. And you know, here's the thing, we all have a different starting point because of where
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:28.400]   we're living, where we exist consciously, we live in a different place. And so everybody's different.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:33.520]   That's why everybody's experiencing Leila quantum tech way differently. But if you're not feeling
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:39.840]   anything, then you know, take a look at your sixth sense and take a look at where you're vibrating
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.720]   and find a way and you know, finding the way is this, this is the way. I mean, if you do this stuff,
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.760]   you can't help but raise your vibration. And then eventually, one day you realize that, hey,
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.720]   even even when you drive through traffic, nothing's ticking you off. And you're at peace. And I'm
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.280]   personally, I'm almost there, you know, I'm almost there. I've been doing this 20 something years.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:04.560]   I'm still not there. I still get a little irritated. You know, all of us, all of us use
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:09.360]   our vehicles as our little venting chambers. But bottom line, though, is I find myself more and
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.480]   more at peace and not reacting. You know, the psychologists call that, you know, the separation
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:20.400]   between reaction between exposure interaction, right? Like, can you separate the time between
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.480]   when something happens and when you react to it? And the more time that you could put in between
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:29.600]   those two things, the stronger you are, you know, the more conscious you are, the more, you know,
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.840]   resolve that you have, you know, I have is between stimulus and response. That's there. That's
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:41.120]   what they say. They call it stimulus and response. So there you go. So that is the reasons why you
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:47.840]   most likely are not feeling anything. This is how you can then work on that and change it so that
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:54.480]   you can. And I just want to say one last thing is that there is no silver bullet. There's no pill.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:58.480]   That's going to make any of this just happen. Putting your head in the block is not going to
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.200]   auto all of a sudden make you feel it. But you know, one of the things Philip did mention in his
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:09.280]   little clip was that exposure to that block and doing it repeatedly over time does make a difference.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:16.960]   I'm a living example of someone who used to have really severe PTSD. And then over three years
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:24.640]   of using these energy tools, I overcame it. And I was able to kind of push out of it. And it was
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:30.720]   just a incredible, remarkable personal journey that I had. But I'm a living testimony to like,
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:36.720]   yeah, it's possible. If it's possible for me, it's possible for you. So thank you for watching this.
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.120]   I hope this was helpful and I hope some of these tips will help you. I know that, you know, it is
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:46.400]   a struggle. It is kind of frustrating where you're reading all these people reporting incredible
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:51.120]   results and you're not having any. But you know, just, you know, if you could just have some patients,
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.760]   have some understanding that, you know, that there's we all have a different starting point
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.240]   and that it's possible. And that's the key thing is that you have that ability, you have a sixth
