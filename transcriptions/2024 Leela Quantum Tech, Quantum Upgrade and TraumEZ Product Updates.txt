[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Hello everyone. Welcome to another Tinkers Academy video. This is Kay Elmer, your host.
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.400]   I've got Philip von Holzendorf on the line with me to talk about 2024 product updates for
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.280]   a Leila Quantum Tech, Quantum Upgrade, and the traumies. So Philip, welcome.
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:23.200]   And yeah, so you posted about a week ago some really cool stuff about what's coming down the
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.000]   pipe for this year. So I kind of just grabbed your post out of Telegram and if you wanted to kind of
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.920]   maybe kind of like, you know, elaborate on it because all, you know, all we got were these bullets,
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.520]   but so I've got the three different posts here. So if you want, could you just kind of elaborate
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.680]   for us? Like what's coming down the pipe and about when can people expect, you know, some of these new
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.480]   new products and services? So let's start with this. Okay, great. So let's start with the for
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.160]   Leila Quantum products. This is Leila Quantum Tech. Number one, you know, I guess we're like a
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.520]   week or two passes, but you've already launched the infinity block booster capsules. And you've
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.640]   already launched the newest infinity blocks, right? So those are out there. And we are, we are working
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:16.800]   on making deuterium depleted water. We were actually successful in making that, but we still need to
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.120]   do a lot of lab testing. And then the actual goal is to, you know, all goals not really to make
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.600]   deuterium depleted water. The goal is to, and we're not sure if we'll succeed, to be honest, but we
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.440]   figure we'll just put it out there, you know, and maybe people can cheer us on. But the idea is to
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.560]   create a device that like, like the block, that people can use to make deuterium depleted water
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.960]   themselves because we actually found some absolutely significant, you know, qualities of deuterium
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:57.280]   depleted water. And it's quite fascinating. And so that's what we're working on, see if we'll succeed.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.760]   And then another thing is that I think the Olympic performance frequency we so far have not really
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.880]   launched it as a card. I think for at the latest Q2, that's also on the horizon to create that as
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.480]   a card probably and possibly in another way. I've been thinking about wristbands or something like
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.600]   that. But you know, that's just me thinking as a tennis player. But that would be kind of a cool
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.280]   thing. Okay. Oh, man, you know this, when you said the deuterium depleted water, I've been following
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.400]   that story for years and trying to figure out a way to afford it. What like, what do you think,
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.160]   like how low can you go? I mean, what do you think with what your approach? So first of all,
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.640]   yeah, so we tested, and we're still testing some, but we've been testing several deuterium
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.200]   depleted waters. And it seems that there isn't even a huge benefit anymore from going too low.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.160]   So we tested, I think, eight PPM up to 24 PPM. And then it starts to be
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:10.560]   not such a big difference anymore. The difference is marginal. Even the, I think, the largest player
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.160]   in the space from Romania, actually, I've met one of the owners of that company at a conference.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.720]   He's a super nice guy. And they make 24 PPM and 18 PPM. And also he would tell you that
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.000]   there isn't really a big difference anymore. But people obviously gravitate to the lower the
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.600]   better. But at 24 PPM, you already have amazing deuterium depleted water. And we didn't see much
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.440]   of a benefit energetically. We saw a lot of benefits, though, of that water. And then, you know,
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.920]   even upcharging it, then an affinity block, absolutely fascinating. So a few things that,
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.480]   you know, people can read about deuterium depleted water. Obviously, these people need to be very
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.640]   careful of what they write, because they can't stay, it helps you with cancer and all of that,
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.560]   you know, you know, the drill, certainly, because you can't stay in this well. But
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.800]   yeah, so they position this as longevity water. And I think that's smart. But certain things,
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.880]   I'm sure they don't even know. Like we found out, for example, that so this Romanian company,
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:26.480]   they sell these waters in the heart plastic bottles. Okay. And we all know that plastic
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.080]   gets in the water. You know, you get microplastic particles that gets in the water, no matter what
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.000]   water you drink. However, it doesn't happen with deuterium depleted water, which is very,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.440]   very fascinating. It doesn't take on the plastic. And if you add frequencies, then you have an
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:53.760]   amplified absorption and delivery mechanism off the water with the frequency. So there's
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:01.760]   a lot of really cool stuff. And yeah, and it's but it's so expensive, right? That, you know, you just,
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.680]   I mean, a normal person couldn't just afford to drink just this water. So at this point,
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.920]   you know, go with very good filtered water and, and you know, charge it in the block and you'll
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:23.280]   have amazing water. But I think we can take it to next level. If we can indeed make a deuterium
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.560]   depleted and then roll it out in a way where everyone becomes self sufficient, right? And not
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.760]   with technology that costs $250,000. Right. Yeah, you know, I'm, I'm over the over the charts
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.040]   excited about this. And I wish you guys all the luck in your, your research. So I just want to
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.520]   clarify though, you're thinking about, or you're working on a method to produce at least 24 ppm
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.080]   deuterium depleted water. I mean, you're going to go that low. So that's going to be the end product
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:59.600]   of your, of your device. At this point, we don't know if we don't succeed, but that is, that is what
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.520]   we're something along those lines is what we're trying to aim. Yeah, pretty amazing. Well, I'm
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.600]   rooting you on. And I look forward to hearing more about this as you guys proceed with your
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.680]   research. But that's amazing. If you could do it, you're going to help so many people. Okay, so
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.920]   you're also looking at putting the Olympic frequency in a card. Are you looking at any more
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.320]   frequency cards though this year? Or is that just going to be more frequencies added to quantum
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.640]   upgrade? Is it just, you know, for Laila? Well, it's a good question. I don't have any in mind
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.960]   currently. But you know, how it goes usually within a year, there's, there's probably going to be a
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.800]   couple of frequencies that we'll roll out with. And probably the, the community will help with that
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.120]   and put in some requests. Okay, great. Hey, I just want to, before we jump to the next one,
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.240]   I just want to let everybody know, we just recorded the infinity block booster capsules video,
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.560]   where we talk about the first two block, you know, the first two products here. So you can catch
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.320]   more about those in that other video. But the DDW thing is just exciting. So, okay, so that's
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:11.440]   what's coming for Laila quantum tech. Now for quantum upgrade, you'd mentioned that you're going
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:19.760]   to increase the regular levels to 1400 levels on the scale and booster levels up to 22. Wow.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:27.520]   That's pretty high. So is that coming out this quarter, then first quarter, like this spring?
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:34.400]   This month, this month, that's, that's what we're aiming for. You know, I mean, you know,
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.560]   there's always the possibility it doesn't work up. But my goal is that this month, this is,
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.720]   this is done. And I know the team is working on it and they, they have a lot to do. And I said,
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.640]   I would like to really launch this already this month. So,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.560]   Okay. So you did, you did footnote that that both are not available to new customers,
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:00.080]   but it's going to be with 10 year. So how long do the people have to wait to access these higher
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:06.960]   level boosters? That is my to do. So if we don't roll it out by the end of January, and then you
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:15.280]   all know it was my fault. So no, I still have to basically put the logic behind that because
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:22.720]   yeah, you know, it's, you know how it is, right? You need to look at everyone. You have the advanced
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.920]   folks, right? That can take in a lot. And then you have some of the very new ones and you really
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:34.400]   don't want them to be overwhelmed. So I'll have to look into it in a quiet minute and just take an
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.720]   hour and write it all down. Okay. No, I get it. I totally get it. Oh, you know, hey,
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.960]   I just got a question on this new booster level. I mean, the grand block is 1800. So if you got a
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.000]   booster at 22, is that like sticking your head in a grand block for a couple of, for an hour?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.520]   Like I can set my booster for 90 minutes. So if I set my, my booster for 90 minutes at
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.920]   2200, that's more powerful than sticking my head in the grand block for an hour and a half.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:07.920]   Is that, well, is that a relatable person? The grand block is at 2200, though, right? Isn't it?
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.640]   That was a, I'm not mistaken. All right. Well, either way, whatever it is, it's pretty much
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:19.280]   that way. Yes. And it's not just the head. Yeah. So I stick in my whole body. Oh, wow. Wow.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:25.520]   That's, that's, yeah, I can't wait to try that. Oh, that's gonna be wild. I'll play the tennis
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:32.000]   nationals probably with the 2020. Yeah, yeah. That's gonna be, that's wild. Okay. So that's like,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.680]   put yourself in, that's put yourself in something stronger than the grand block.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.600]   Wow. Okay. So yeah, I'm gonna try that one. Okay. Okay. So now there's gonna be some new
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.720]   frequencies, the dog and cat ones. So these are the regular dog and cat, the heel for dog
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.320]   and the heel for cat. And that's gonna be available on quantum upgrade.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.200]   Yes. That's correct. All right. And on a separate note, I think
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:05.440]   Junai can possibly revisit the, the, the com for dog. Oh, yeah. Because, you know, I think you had a
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:12.000]   pretty good start there. And I think there were some things that, that Roman saw that, you know,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.640]   obviously he can do in a, in a, from a completely different angle. And maybe we could combine these
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.800]   efforts and maybe for quantum upgrade, I think it would make sense to have that. You know what I
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:29.920]   mean? Oh, yeah. No, that would be for dogs. Oh, that would be great. I mean, I kind of started on
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.880]   that frequency. And I thought I got like as far as I could go because I'm human. But if we could
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:40.800]   get Roman involved, that would be awesome. Because my little dog gets so anxious, you know, when
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:45.680]   there's a storm out or a loud noise. And that's kind of what I designed it for was just his little
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.960]   tiny little chiwini. So I'm just trying to calm her down, you know, but she's not like a chihuahua
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.800]   where she's nervous all the time. She's just nervous with loud noises. So that's why I created
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:02.560]   that. But if Roman could add his little flair to that, that'd be awesome. That would be great.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.760]   Okay. No, that'd be fantastic. So and my little dog just came actually a little more more. She
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.040]   just came to be here. And that's interesting. And she gets anxious when she needs to go to the
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:18.240]   groomer or she needs to go to the vet. So yeah, they just nervous. I mean, well, I've got I've
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.280]   got my daughter has a Belgian Malinois, which is a military dog. And that dog has more anxiety
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:29.920]   than anybody else in the family. So anxiety is not just not just the, you know, belongs to little
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:35.520]   dogs. Okay, so now there was a question in the telegram group about the dog frequency. Like,
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.160]   what bundle are you going to add it to? Or is it going to be like animals are going to be a separate
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.720]   other by itself, separate bundle? Okay. All right. So there'll be a separate animal
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:51.200]   ones, because I see you're adding horses. But but but what I'm thinking though, is that whoever has
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.800]   the all in one frequency bundle, I'm pretty certain that it will be added there as well. Don't, you
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:05.680]   know, don't quote me. But maybe I'll get overwritten by someone at this point that that will be my goal.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.360]   All right. Cool. So you're going to add horses, right? So people who have horses that can
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.200]   add put like literally have a subscription for their horse, correct?
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.520]   Yes. Okay. All right. So is it going to be like a heal for horses?
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:27.840]   It's a good point. We probably need to develop that. Yes. Oh, cool. Correct. And we we've had a
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:34.240]   lot of requests actually regarding horses. So I think, you know, that's something good to do.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.960]   Oh, yeah, I could see how it really benefit horses. I used to have one old guy needed a lot of help.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:46.080]   That would have been nice to have at the time. Okay. So what about livestock down the road?
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.760]   Because I could see how, you know, farms would benefit from having
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:13:03.360]   pre yeah. So I think for them, I would I would, you know, I mean, it's it's it's hard, you know,
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:09.440]   I don't think it could be like for a horse. But let's say you have 100 chickens. I think you would
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:20.080]   want to have the whole, you know, area basically put in like the home location service for quantum
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.880]   upgrade. I think that one would be the one to make sense. And then in terms of frequency,
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:32.160]   yeah, why not something for chickens? I mean, to be honest, I probably think it is
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.560]   low priority at this point. Okay. All right. So one last one for quantum
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.040]   upgrade is you're going to do a pineal gland activating frequency. So like, is that like a
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:48.800]   third eye awakening kind of thing? Yeah, that's pretty much what it would be like. And that would
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   probably mean we would do that and launch that for Leela quantum tech as well.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:14:00.160]   It's just something we we started working on, but it needs a whole lot more work. So I don't
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:06.400]   think before the end of Q two, this will really come out. But it's it's a great one. I think
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.760]   especially for these times. Cool. Yeah. Cause you know, I also tried started working on one and
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.920]   never quite finished it. So maybe I ought to finish it and throw it at you and you see what you do
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:21.600]   with it. Okay. No, that's awesome. All right. So that's what's coming for quantum upgrade. And
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:29.520]   we're looking at it happening this quarter, 2024. Yes. Okay. Okay. So now you've got the new product
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.720]   updates for traumese. And I noticed that in your post, you said this was going to be free. So free
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.840]   is awesome. I love that price. I think everybody else is going to. So if you have traumese today,
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:46.320]   you're going to get this for free. So once you go ahead, so you posted two things in telegram about
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.520]   something called amazing travel and something called Vax harmonization. So what are these two
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:15:00.000]   things for? Yes, absolutely. And I want to say that the trauma easy is one of the really most
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   underestimated tools we have. And I don't think I speak enough about it, to be honest. But it already
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:16.080]   now with the trauma functions is an incredible tool to lighten ourselves to work on ourselves and,
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:24.560]   you know, lift these traumas and convert them into life force energy. And now for everyone that has
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:31.600]   it, we are adding the amazing travel button. So what happens is that there will be an actual app,
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:39.040]   an actual app that you can be able to download. And there's not very much to do on there. You know,
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:44.560]   you don't really have to do much there. But there what you'll find there is two buttons.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:51.600]   One is the amazing travel button. And that one, once you activate it, and here, by the way,
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:58.240]   I'd give you false information if I told you 24 hours, but it's 12 hours, actually. So we set
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:06.960]   it on 12 hours. So once you click that, then a special energy will start vibrating from the phone,
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:13.600]   which is specifically meant to support anyone who's like on the go right now, whether it's
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:19.840]   on the go to the grocery store, or you're traveling to Australia, or you're traveling to visit
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:29.280]   grandma or whoever. You're in a plane car train. It doesn't really matter about. And it really,
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:38.480]   it really helps you to get into the here and now to be at ease and at balance. And it's sort of
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:44.480]   like you're you're having this special travel energy bubble for an amazing travel. That's pretty
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:53.120]   much what it does. It automatically turns off after 12 hours. But let's say you have a longer travel
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:59.600]   or you you will resume your travel. Then after the 12 hours, you can activate it again. And it will
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.960]   again run for 12 hours. So that's pretty much how that works. And I'm sure we'll get into more
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:10.960]   details at some point once we launch it. And then the Vax harmonization, we will call that a little
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:16.480]   bit differently because we need to be a little bit mindful. But for now, that's kind of like the
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:28.800]   project title, I would say. It it actually is incredible. Absolutely. I've witnessed it several
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:41.600]   times. It is meant to harmonize and convert Vax. I'm not even saying the word now because I
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:48.080]   are, you know, we need to be careful of any kind and of anyone that you have had in the past,
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:57.280]   whether as a one year old to year old or just recently converts, you know, that into life force
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:06.800]   energy. And with that, it transforms any type of energetic contract, blockages,
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:17.680]   pain, attachments, etc., also into life force energy. And it is very, very powerful.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:26.000]   Even light damage that was done, you know, can be countered with this. You know, if
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:35.440]   if there's very advanced damage done, you know, then it still does some help. But, you know,
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:42.880]   there's, you know, we, we, for example, we had a we had a case where someone had developed a
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:48.640]   in a very young age, actually an absolute terrible cancer. And that was at a stage where
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:54.720]   we already knew beforehand, you know, there's, you can't do anything anymore there. You know,
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.680]   it was a quite sad story, actually, but, you know, obviously, you know, if something has developed
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.960]   into something major, you know, then, you know, you can still help. You can still use the process,
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:12.400]   but, you know, that that person will be gone from birth pretty soon. And, but besides that, it
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:19.040]   really helps significantly with these issues. And the way it will work is you also press that
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:26.480]   button, then it activates and you put it in your thymus gland. And then there will be basically
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:33.520]   three waves of energy that will go through you and you don't need to do anything. You just
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:40.560]   let it happen. And we will explain, you know, these three steps. Obviously, once we launch it,
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:48.480]   with the third step, it really is like the integration of body, mind, and soul. So where you really,
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:54.160]   if people can feel this, and a lot of people actually feel this, is that the soul fully enters
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:01.360]   the body again. This is so profound. It's, it's, it's even if you have like two feet that are,
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:08.320]   you know, of different size that then the size of the feet, we've seen them even out,
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:13.360]   right? And things like that. It is very, very profound. It's an absolutely amazing feeling where
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:19.920]   suddenly the body from having been sort of disconnected from the soul because of,
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:27.280]   you know, whatever issues we've, we've gone through, right? That it reenters that it's,
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:33.520]   it's an amazing feeling. And we've seen many people where this has done some wonders.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.280]   So that's pretty much what happens. And then, then after that, after you get done,
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:42.640]   and that takes about, I would say five to 10 minutes, right? Until that process is done,
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:50.560]   maybe give it 10 minutes. And then after that, you basically use the, the, the trauma easy and do
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:58.800]   the trauma work per the steps, you know, that we outline in the PDF for this specific topic. So
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:05.360]   you're using basically in, you know, vaccination, you know, as the topic, any trauma in regards to
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.440]   vaccination that I've gotten in my life, right? Okay. So you use that. And then you go through
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:18.880]   this process for this specific trauma, and also, you know, basically get all this trauma out,
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:25.600]   and you will feel like a new person after that. Wow. Wow. That's really cool. So there is, so
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:31.680]   there's a process to, you have to do some inner work along with your traumies, your phone that's
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.680]   got traumies on it in order to do the harmonization, right? And then the travel is just something you
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:43.360]   turn on, but you have to have your phone on you. Correct. Okay. Yes. Wow. That sounds amazing.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.640]   I can't wait. So that's going to happen in the next couple of months then. That is correct. Yes.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:54.480]   Okay. Well, thank you so much for giving us the updates for 2024. That's amazing. Can't wait to
