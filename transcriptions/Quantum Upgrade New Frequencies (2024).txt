[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   Aloha everyone and welcome to another tinker's academy video
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.200]   I'm your host K Elmer and I've got on the phone Philip von Holtsendorf with Leila quantum tecta
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.840]   Discuss with you guys the new frequencies that have just been added to quantum upgrades. So welcome Phillip
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:22.000]   Hey K, I'm glad I'm on. Yeah, we're gonna do it. Oh, let's go ahead. Sorry
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.360]   No, I'm just looking forward to this. Yeah, yeah, cuz you know cuz today is the launch of the new frequencies
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.520]   Just recently added to quantum upgrade. So we're gonna go ahead and Phillip's gonna just just basically explain
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.400]   What's been added and answer a few questions that I pull I pulled out of the check group
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.520]   So that everybody is aware of the new
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.080]   Frequencies for quantum upgrade and it all is included with what you're already doing
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.280]   So let me go ahead and read the disclosure in place. We say something that we need to disclose
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.360]   So our standard disclaimer is neither quantum upgrade nor takers Academy recommend or endorse any specific test physicians
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.800]   Procedures opinions or other information that may be mentioned in this video
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.280]   Reliance on any information appearing and discussing this video solely at everyone's own risks statements made have not been evaluated by the EFSA or FDA
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.420]   Any quantum upgrade products and products that quantum upgrade may represent are not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.400]   So there you go, and I've always got to say that right, Phillip
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.440]   Yeah, you know how it is. Okay, so so the very first thing is
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.600]   There's three new frequencies added to the existing
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.240]   Bundles so here's here's so there's a new frequency and abundance and a new frequency in the heel bundle
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.320]   So Phillip can you kind of just share with everybody like what are the two new frequencies down here?
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.240]   One's called unity one's called resurrection and how that and how like you know, it does it affect the price and and so forth
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.720]   Mm-hmm, so last question answered first
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.480]   So it does not affect the price here. So the whoever has the abundance bundle or the heel bundle
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.880]   Does not need to pay anything more? We're just adding this for free and
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.840]   That's also the case for all of the frequencies that we're adding and the all-in-one frequency bundle
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.520]   You know that we had started in the beginning. I think I don't know when we may have had like
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.440]   10 14 15 frequencies there at first and we had increased it to 20 and now I
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.480]   don't even know you may have counted it, but we should be well over over 26 frequencies by now and
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.640]   That's all included in the existing price in the all-in-one frequency bundle
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.080]   That's our goal to just continue to add more value
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.840]   for that and
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.700]   Not increase that price. All right, that being said so the unity frequency
[00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.360]   and the resurrection frequency
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.800]   those are two frequencies that we've had for a while already on the Lila quantum tech side as
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.120]   frequency cards and
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.360]   Several people had asked, you know when we would add those and
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.600]   Now we have added the unity
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.720]   one good reason to add that is because
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.760]   Everything in the world right now or not maybe everything, but a lot of that
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:29.360]   tries to move everyone into separation and into different sides and and perspectives that then
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.720]   fight against each other basically and that's
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.960]   That's something that
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:44.920]   You know basically helps that the friction continues to be there and unity is is the way out of that if we can
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.600]   Open our hearts and be more in unity with everything with all that is
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.200]   Then we have a better stand
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.120]   We're more at peace more at balance and then
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.840]   more healing can actually
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.620]   Happen within us and in the world around us and so that's pretty much what the unity frequency
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.680]   promotes in us this sense of unity and this
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.240]   spot of unity within us
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.120]   can be
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.240]   Expanded in an easier way and isn't that blocked anymore and on the heel side and and it's part of
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.800]   Abundance also. It's part of the abundance a package
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.020]   You know that's sometimes a little bit hard to allocate to be honest with these frequencies, but in this case
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.520]   it's really an
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.440]   aspect of ourselves that
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.960]   We have at our disposal at all times, but you know nowadays
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.080]   You know most people don't really have a sense of unity and I think it's a it's a good way to get back into that
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.040]   And then on the heel side. We added resurrection
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.160]   which that
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.960]   can help to
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:05.200]   ease and neutralize past experiences also from past lives that
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.800]   Make us react in a way that it's not natural to us in our essence
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.320]   And it actually also gives ourselves a reset in that regard. So it
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.200]   You know on an energetic level
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.040]   It's a cell reset and it it helps us to leave some past
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.080]   experiences behind that we're still
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:38.480]   Working on so it you know, I don't want to get into the trauma thing here, but you know, it it works a little bit in that area
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.920]   Okay, so let me ask a question about unity is that is the unity frequency?
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.920]   for
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.040]   You know for like inner work where it helps you not allow not be
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.400]   Divided, you know, like you don't like succumb to those
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.360]   energies where you know, there's constant energy right to divide us and to polarize the way we all behave
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.360]   You know, it's just it's permeated right in media everywhere you go people are trying to divide
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.320]   You right so does it help you not succumb to that or is it more like a unity frequency?
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.280]   Like I would put on my home to get everybody that's living in the same place to get along better
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.320]   Which well actually yeah, great. It's a great question. I think it can be used for both
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.840]   Okay, I think first and foremost it works first on on ourselves in the inside
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.240]   totally independent from what's happening in the outside because
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:38.080]   Anyway, if we didn't have separation and different voices in the inside it wouldn't
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.320]   We wouldn't get dragged into that in the outside either, right?
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.680]   So there needs to be a resident
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:51.920]   So first it starts working there and with that it helps us to also not be dragged into that in the outside and certainly if you want to have
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.120]   An energy of unity in your home
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.600]   Then this is one is a great one to test. Yeah in business, right?
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.880]   That's where I was thinking like what's the best way using a unity in a for business would be awesome, right?
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.440]   If the business is struggling with internal drama
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:19.440]   Okay, that sounds great. Okay, so then resurrection first thought in my mind was like, you know because people have been asking, you know
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.480]   How do I combine quantum upgrade and and traumese?
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:29.040]   So it sounds like resurrection would be a really great frequency to be running, right while you're using traumese
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.360]   Because if you want to do that
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.440]   Interesting test
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.280]   Interesting test I haven't tested it, but yeah that would be an interesting test
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.560]   Yeah, because that's what we get on the traumese questions is like, you know
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.360]   I got I got qu and I got traumese and how do they work together and sounds like this
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.440]   Resurrection frequency is going to help kind of all that past stuff
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:58.640]   So great. So two new frequencies one in the abundance bundle one in the heel bundle
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.840]   And then there's this other one in the source bundle
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:08.960]   There's a new frequency is a third new frequency called the pineal gland activation. So can you describe that one?
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:15.680]   Yes, so that is a very very interesting one and we have been asked for that for quite some time
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.440]   And developed it over several months and it it is a
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:27.920]   frequency based on, you know, etheric frequencies and molecular frequencies
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.600]   I can tell you
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.640]   In regards to molecular it includes borax
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:41.200]   Which is maybe interesting. So if you guys don't know anything about borax, you may want to research that and maybe
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   Don't check your mainstream sources, but check some real sources
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:52.400]   and learn about that and it's it's a fascinating substance actually and
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.600]   Often known in terms of supplementation as boron
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.640]   b-o-r-o-n
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:07.360]   And but then yeah borax is part of that and it it activates the pineal gland it helps
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.080]   Accelerate a decalcification process off the pineal gland
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.680]   And I just want to say right up front
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:20.320]   It isn't the case that if you turn on the frequency that suddenly then you can see
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.920]   entities and everything and and you're like
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.480]   You don't have any issues with your pineal gland anymore. That's not how it works because
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.600]   The pineal gland has actually suffered
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:39.440]   pretty much in everyone since a very very very long time because of many different reasons
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.040]   And it's a process to to heal the pineal gland basically
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.240]   and to to really get it decalcified and
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.640]   Opened again and activated
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.280]   And this frequency
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:59.280]   Significantly helps with that. That is that is the goal and and then some people ask me
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.680]   So what what does that that do what function does it have right and
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.200]   Often we hear that the pineal gland is called the third eye and it's
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:16.160]   It's sort of a gateway into our spiritual or energetic existence, right? We can
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.360]   If if it's activated and more free then we can
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.960]   really see energy better we
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.160]   We can
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.200]   Allow pictures to come up in a different way our dream state will be
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.480]   much more
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:43.520]   How do I say that much more intense and we tend to remember more of it and
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.480]   Yeah, so and we also
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.640]   Can perceive ourselves better. So that's in a nutshell
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.560]   I mean
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.680]   My quick elevator speech about the pineal gland and now you have this great picture here. That's cool
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.800]   Yeah, we got we got questions yesterday. So I just want to make sure I address the questions that one of the questions was
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   You know, like where is it?
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.640]   Because you know, there are there are you know, obviously there's people that aren't familiar with the even the idea that we have one
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:16.880]   So I just wanted to kind of point out where is the pineal gland and it's in the center of your brain
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.560]   And there's a lot of stuff about it
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:26.160]   If you research it in terms of it getting calcified because of the chemicals in the water
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.240]   And you know environment and once it gets calcified
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.880]   You know, it doesn't work as well and etc. I won't get into it too much
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.720]   So I just want to point out. So this is where it is and so Philip. Can you
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.600]   So that was the first question. I think where is it and then the other question was okay?
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.960]   So it's called activation
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:50.080]   But you just said that the frequency does both right because the other question we had about it
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.840]   Was does the frequency also detox the pineal gland and I believe you just said does is that correct?
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:01.840]   Well, it stimulates and supports that detox effect, right? So
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:08.240]   Obviously, there are certain other things that you want to do, right? You want to make sure you don't have
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.280]   A fluoride intake or if you
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:17.920]   Can't resist that then try to at least minimize that right? It's commonly found in in regular tap water
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:23.040]   Unfortunately, you find it in most toothpastes. So just pay attention
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:30.160]   Maybe try a great toothpaste that doesn't have fluoride and and then certain other things. So that's what you want to do
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:37.200]   Take care on all levels about this, but it does indeed support this process
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.400]   100% and by the way, there's something that comes to mind because and you may want to
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.800]   Uh search on google for frank illaridi
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:54.480]   A-R-I-D-I and I think on his and and then third eye
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.000]   Children or kids or something like that
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.600]   You will find it somehow when you search
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.520]   Maybe we can link at some point here to that video too, but
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:14.560]   He actually went to I think it was india and there's a guru there that works with kids
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.920]   and active it brings their pineal gland to a point where
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:26.800]   They literally can see everything and everything around them when their regular eyes are
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:35.280]   Completely closed, right? You know, you could have like five towels on top of like dark towels on top of their eyes
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:42.880]   And they would still see everything that is because they have a fully activated third eye or pineal gland
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:49.040]   and especially with kids it's it's way way easier and faster to do that because
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.480]   They haven't gone through the whole long process of
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:14:01.440]   Slowly killing and depleting the pineal gland. It's fascinating videos, you know and interviews there
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.560]   So that that shows you what's actually possible
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.680]   Wow, that's cool. Okay. I'll look that up and if I can find it, I'll put it in the video description
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:15.520]   So that's really cool. Thanks for sharing that. So I just want to point out to anyone who's not familiar with it
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.880]   A pineal gland is inside the center of your brain and then from a spiritual standpoint
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.000]   It's located between the forehead chakra and the brow chakra
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.960]   So it's right there and that's why it's called the third eye
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.600]   The pineal glands also referred to as the the third eye from a spiritual standpoint
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.080]   So this frequency sounds amazing. It sounds like a really great use for it
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.880]   If I'm if I'm correct is for at nighttime for while you're sleeping
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.600]   I'm definitely going to give it a try tonight
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:51.440]   Because I I suggest that and then also during the day though
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.240]   I I tested it for quite some time and I and it really enjoyed the frequency
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.120]   So it was one that I really enjoyed having
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.240]   Okay, now that's great advice. Okay, so that's the pineal gland the new frequency
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:09.440]   And it's part of the source bundle and it's now included as of today. It's right there in your list
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.640]   And go for it. So now let's talk about the next
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.160]   New frequencies, which is a new bundle. Okay, so it's not it's not part of any other bundle
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:24.240]   It's a new bundle and it's called the animal frequency bundle. Correct and it's got five frequencies
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.640]   Three of them or I guess two of them have been around for a while, which is heal for dogs and heal for cats
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.120]   but could but can you talk about
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:39.840]   What all the frequencies are and then and then you know and just kind of just a brief description of them for everyone who
[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.400]   Isn't familiar with this
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.720]   Yep, and and so just so you know if you have an all-in-one frequency bundle
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:52.320]   You have access to this as well already. So it's yeah, exactly. It's it's part of that
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.840]   and
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:59.440]   Obviously animals are very close to my heart and all of our heart and and people asked
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.000]   many times can you do something for
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.240]   For dogs cats, etc. So now we have this and let's go through the different frequencies
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.640]   so the com for animals that is an interesting one because
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.160]   frankly the idea to have like a
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:22.880]   Frequency that you know helps with the anxiety came from you originally right where you said well my dogs there
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:28.720]   They have so much anxiety and all of that and you know and the whole process of looking into that
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.520]   Roman found that
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.680]   If we provide such a frequency for animals
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.960]   There is one that we need to use because it comes from the animals themselves
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.800]   but
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.600]   A lot of the animals especially the ones that live don't live in the original nature anymore
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:54.720]   They tend to get cut off of that and it's the same frequency that for example the elephants use
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.360]   if they walk
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.160]   jointly in in a herd and
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:08.640]   It's it's it's it's not a frequency that puts anyone to sleep or something like that has nothing to do with sleep
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.520]   It's more very very powerful very calming peaceful
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.440]   Frequency that's what it is and it's in in all the animals use it
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:24.880]   All animals originally had access to it and somehow still have access to it
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:31.920]   So and then we you know we tested it also on dogs on cats and and all of that and yeah
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.960]   That's the one available. So at some point if we have
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.760]   more
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.240]   Animals available besides horses cats and dogs
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:48.560]   You could also use this one for for any rabbit or you know, whatever. So yeah, that's that frequency
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.840]   Okay, so like I originally remember when roman looked at the
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.200]   The one I made I made the one I made is not this one
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.040]   This is a new one
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.880]   But I remember you roman mentioning that it was like the column for dogs that I had created was was okay
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.200]   You know not not as good as this one, but it also kind of helped with pain management
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.960]   What was this? So does this one also kind of help with pain management?
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.200]   Or is it more like calming anxiety and nervousness in our animals?
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:24.000]   Yeah, that's a good question actually. No, we did not focus on pain management at all actually
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.160]   In regards to this. So this would be a new one and maybe we'll have to do another contest
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:38.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, because my calm yeah the comfort dog had all these pain meds in there because that was what was prescribed to calm dogs
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.280]   Yeah, and that's why I put it in there
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.800]   But it sounds like this one's just a frequency from nature that the animals themselves harmonize, right?
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:53.920]   And so it settles down restlessness anxiousness and so yeah, that's great. I'm looking forward to trying this on my little dog
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:58.240]   Great. Okay, that's great to hear so heal for dog heal for cats
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.960]   Been around for a while now. There's a heal for horses. So the question for me is like
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.480]   if it would the heal for horses also work with
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.080]   you know like livestock
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.840]   People that reach sheep and cattle and other types of herbivores
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.960]   That's a good question at this point. I don't think so but
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.680]   That that's really that's really something that that I can't answer
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:31.840]   I would have to go to to crew enrollment to ask that question myself if it would help with them as well
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.120]   Usually we find that for these heal frequencies is there's an overarching
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.400]   Aspect of it, but then there's a lot of specifics also for each individual
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.120]   Animal and really dogs and cats are very very
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.600]   Different in that sense and then horses are again completely different
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:58.000]   Yeah, I can just only imagine that I mean from my perspective goats are also very and sheep are also very different
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.600]   So I I think it wouldn't I think we would have to create a new one, but okay mavadu inquire
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   Okay, and then just for folks that aren't familiar with heal could you kind of give a brief description of what heal is?
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.840]   Yeah, so in a nutshell what what the heal a frequency is supposed to do
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.880]   Whether that's a heal frequency for for humans or in this case for dogs cats horses
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.600]   It activates the inner healer or translated in layman terms
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.960]   Your self healing powers are supposed to get activated and
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:38.000]   That's in a nutshell what it's designed to do and as humans we have this inborn
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.400]   Primal healing frequency
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.760]   to be able to really activate that and
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.960]   Dogs have that too and like all all animals have that as well
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.800]   and
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:01.120]   This is pretty much that it's just very specific for each each animal
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.200]   so if your horse has
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.160]   any issue any information any
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.720]   any pain whatever
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.720]   this is a good one to choose so that
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:19.920]   Really the immune system gets gets activated and the whole system moves quickly towards a healing mode
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.120]   Okay. All right. So, you know, I didn't test before the
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:29.360]   Before we talk today about because I I have my like on quantum upgrade. I have my dog subscribed
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.720]   Right as as one of the us right?
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:38.080]   So now so in quantum upgrade, I can now subscribe my cat or my horse
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:44.880]   Horses and they can have their own subscription so that I could send the frequency individually to that animal
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.080]   Yes, okay. So now you can sign up your dogs
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.680]   I mean in addition to dogs you can set up a cat and a horse
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:58.800]   Or I could or would it be possible if I had a barn I could just set up the barn as a home and then play the whole frequency to the home
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.440]   You can certainly do that too. That that is also possible
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:09.120]   Yes, that's also possible then then you want to make sure that you don't have all kinds of different animals there
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.840]   Then again, I don't know if the the heal for
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:17.120]   Then I would just stay with just the regular quantum upgrade in no specific frequency
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:23.600]   I mean at nights you could do the comp for animals. Maybe I guess that's oh, that's a good good good for all of them. But um
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.600]   Yeah, that's that's how I see it
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.480]   And then you know the racehorse support is maybe a little bit interesting here because yeah
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:37.200]   Probably most most people don't have race horses, but we said okay if we offer something for horses, then
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.000]   We have to also offer something for race horses because they're so different
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.800]   And and roman noticed that actually through his work because he actually helped a several race horses already
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.600]   Uh in the past through his work, you know
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.760]   He was called many times to help uh race horses and he found out that
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.240]   They're very different from from just a regular horse
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:08.000]   Also because they tend to get a lot of medication and just different stimuli than uh than regular horses
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.960]   And uh he found through his work. He created a frequency at the time
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.440]   And to help those race horses really on a regular basis
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.240]   So so this race uh horse support frequency is one that can be run
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.640]   Overlong and extended periods of times at no problem
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.320]   It just should not be run and that's maybe one disclaimer
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.760]   We should put in it should not be run during a race
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.240]   Because it it may be too much
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:42.320]   So it can be before the race and after the race and all of that but not during race
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:47.280]   So i'll make myself a note here and I don't expect that we have all these race horses
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.080]   That's really wiles okay
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.960]   No, that was I was really surprised to see that pop up and you know in the literature when I put the deck together
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.920]   So
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.400]   Hey, I got a question there, you know as a former horse owner, you know
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.760]   That's why I was thinking because you know, I'm a i'm a former barn dad if you guys know what that means and uh
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.320]   So i'm always hanging around. I spent decades hanging around barns full of horses
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.880]   So that's why I had the you know the idea for just set up a home frequency for your barn
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.640]   But the other thing too, I don't know if you know this or not uh, but i'm just wondering if for
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.520]   For us, you know horse people fill up because there's the difference between you know
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.080]   You've got an active racehorse and then when they retire
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:28.880]   They have a thing called off-the-track thoroughbreds, you know that that people like normal
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:34.640]   equestrians will go and purchase these horses and then retrain them to be jumpers hunters or
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.200]   Dressage or just you know riding horses, right?
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:45.040]   So these off-the-track thoroughbreds are always really different than the regular horses in the barn because they came from the racing world
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:51.360]   So even after they retire would it be it would like i'm just wondering like what you would think and
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.720]   You know to help that horse kind of adjust to the regular world, you know becoming a civilian
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.520]   Uh, would that racehorse support also was it kind of targeted to?
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.240]   Horses that were raised to be athletes
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:09.600]   And so you would when that would be beneficial for them to continue on using after they retire
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.800]   So if I have an off-the-track thoroughbred, uh, that would be a better
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.800]   Um, you know support frequency than if I had it just like a regular, you know, dressage horse or just you know
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.880]   Like, you know quarter horse or something
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.880]   Are you would you happen to know that level of detail?
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:29.520]   Yes, you can absolutely use it, but you can also use the heel frequency and that's maybe where I
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.480]   Okay was misunderstood by most people
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:38.960]   Listen right now is you can still use the heel for horses or frequency on the race horses
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.640]   That's no problem at all. So if the racehorse really has a big issue
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.120]   Absolutely put that one on that's no problem. It absolutely works for that, but
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.160]   um, we looked into just the regular quantum upgrade for horses
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.640]   and then
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.600]   They're
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.840]   needed to be an additional frequency for those race horses and that's not
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:05.280]   It's not an alternative to the heel. It's rather for a regular support
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:09.280]   And yeah, I agree with with those horses that you just described
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.120]   They they could still very much benefit from the support frequency. Yeah, but if they have a
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.960]   Some issue they can use the heel frequency as well
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:24.000]   Yeah, when they yeah, that's great to hear yeah because when they come off the track and they go into regular barns
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.480]   There's quite an adjustment, you know, uh, so yeah, and they're definitely not like the other horses
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.760]   Uh, but yeah, okay. Cool. That's great to know. Hey horse people
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:38.080]   Uh, yeah try these out and obviously, you know, if you if you find some great stuff happening, please let us know in the community
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:44.160]   Uh, chat group. So yeah, okay. So great. Those are some, uh, great new frequencies a separate bundle
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.520]   So like as this, um, was is noted right now each one of these individual bundles
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:55.280]   I believe is $10 a month or if you get all in one, uh, it's 25. So
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:01.200]   Clearly you get all of these, uh, compliant, you know for 25 now and it's just a separate bundle. So
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.240]   If you want to get it by itself, uh, it's $10 a month and then if it's
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.560]   Uh, if you just get the all in one, it's you if you have it, it's already included, right
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:17.120]   Okay, cool. That is so cool. So yeah, great. And then so now I just plucked out some questions. Um
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.760]   Let's let me just make sure
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.120]   Uh, just to get you to answer but it's like what can people expect, you know?
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:28.480]   So if somebody's like completely new to quantum upgrade and they all of a sudden see these frequencies
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:34.000]   Uh for animals. I mean, what do you what can they expect? And I think we kind of covered that mostly
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   But that was one of the questions that came up
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.400]   Is there like a just a general answer you have to that in terms of like
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.080]   Frequencies for animals as opposed to frequencies for humans
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:50.880]   Is there a difference really in terms of benefits and and help? I don't think there's there's really a difference
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:56.720]   Other than that the frequency is different and it just is tailored towards the animals in that sense
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.120]   um, you know from my perspective what what what I expect, you know when
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:08.000]   When I turn on the heal for dogs now for example, right? I would when would I do that?
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.680]   I would would do that if I have the feeling that my dog is not doing quite well or if it's very obvious
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:18.560]   Right that the dog's not doing doing very well and then I would turn it on and
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:28.320]   Then I would expect that it stimulates the healing process and that it accelerates the healing process and
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.120]   whatever I would do
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.040]   in general
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.280]   Anyway, I don't know to maybe pay a little bit more attention to the dog or
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.320]   I don't know pet the dog, you know, whatever is needed in such a
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:48.400]   Situation or give the dog water. I would still do all of those things. Of course, but
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:56.080]   There will be an acceleration of the process. Okay. All right, so that's great. Um
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.720]   Now in now in terms of number two
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:06.800]   Uh, you know now that people can basically focus frequencies and quantum upgrade on animals cats dogs and horses
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.440]   So what quantum upgrade settings?
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.600]   Do you recommend?
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:17.600]   Because you know clearly you can go from 500 to 1400 right on a day and night basis and then of course
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:24.880]   There's boosters that go from a thousand to twenty two hundred and so is there any kind of like settings or any recommendations?
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.280]   You make for you setting up a dog cat or horse on quantum upgrade?
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:36.880]   Turning on a frequency, but then what you know, like what what what would you set the settings at or what do you recommend for that?
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:41.120]   This is a great question and it it shows that
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.400]   probably we didn't do a perfect job and
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.320]   and covering that in the in the q&a's and
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:55.040]   I would I would start relatively low first, you know, I would start if the
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:02.880]   If your animal has never been exposed to quantum energy, you know, neither through or blogs
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.360]   North through the quantum upgrade then I would start at 600
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:12.240]   And you can leave it probably 600 during the day and 600 at night, you know
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:17.120]   Dogs usually don't have the issue at night that they think too much
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.920]   You know
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:25.440]   I think that that is something you can do you could also put it on 500 and then that would just feel that
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   as much as you can
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.400]   and I would start
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:35.840]   Pretty much on the second day already. I would start with a booster. I think that's great to have
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.600]   And during the day I said a 30-minute booster
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:44.720]   That can be definitely around the 1000 area. No problem
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.360]   and and then
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:53.840]   You see how the dog is doing and then you know over time you can you can increase that and then maybe you end up at
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:31:00.960]   During the day, you know, maybe with 700 or 800 at some point and at nights, maybe at 500 600
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.200]   I don't know if you would go way higher with with your dog in general
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:12.400]   You would have to feel, you know, just it's a good way to actually feel and sense how the dog is doing
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:17.360]   Okay, so yeah, I guess the good recommendation is start start low
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:23.200]   And then observe and see how it goes and and then for boosters for dogs and cast I mean
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.000]   I'm like, you know, like I know I boost like for this interview. I've got my booster at 2200
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.880]   And you know, just to you know, just ramp up my brain but for animals using a booster on an animal
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.560]   I mean we're thinking like what?
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:40.400]   Boosting them for their during their walk boosting them if you take them to the park
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:44.320]   But definitely not doing that at night trying to get him to calm down, right?
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:51.680]   So so it's really for boosting for animals would be more so around activities is that's that's what i'm thinking
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:58.320]   Probably and you know what I've found. Yeah, so when it was when we we fly a lot with with our dog
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:04.640]   And then during the flight sometimes I I give her a boost for the for the beginning of the flight because
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:10.640]   She she gets anxious and now I could even combine it with a with a calm for animals
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:16.400]   Of course, right? So that would be great. And then if we go to the vet, usually I boost the system
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:22.400]   You know, I I boosted for her and and I would now indeed combine it with the calm for animals because
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.520]   She does not like to go to the vet like anytime she goes the vet or to the groomer. It's just
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:35.840]   Uh, no, I can't stand it. She starts shaking and all of that. So that's the only real reasons when that happens and
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.680]   Yeah, it's
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:42.640]   That's where I boosted. That's where I will use this specific frequency also. That's a really good point
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:48.960]   We actually had a okay. So we had a another person ask about a week or so ago in quanta upgrade about
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:56.160]   Um, my dog's going in for surgery, you know, what would be the best way to to use quantum upgrade during the surgery
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:02.960]   I'd said I told him. Yeah, leave it on, you know, so now they now they could definitely boost during the surgery
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.600]   And use heal or calm or you know anything that would help the animal. So
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.880]   Uh, okay. So that's a good recommendation and and yeah as terms of
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.480]   Going to the vet even I don't like to go to the vet. It's like, you know
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.840]   Walking into a casino. You just you just bing bing bing. You just know your money is going to be gone
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.160]   I don't I hate going to the vet
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.320]   Uh, okay, so um
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:32.800]   Okay, so now the other question here is about if my dog and cat already wear a lay like you collar
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:36.960]   Right is adding quantum upgrade and frequencies too much
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:42.080]   You know, is it you know, like would that conflict at all or would it what what's your opinion on that?
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:48.480]   No, for my taste that would not be too much at all and and the
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:53.920]   Obviously the quantum upgrade would be way more powerful than than just the the collar
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.560]   just because it it
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.960]   Think of it as the
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:05.280]   Quantum upgrade for you that you have or if you had just a frequency card, right?
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.440]   the the quantum upgrade for you is so comprehensive because
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:14.960]   It's the difference is you're in a pool or you're
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:21.040]   Walking through a sprinkler somewhere, right and that's that's pretty much the difference
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:26.080]   So the you the quantum upgrade is definitely more powerful
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.720]   But it's also not a problem to
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:33.680]   Have the collar at the same time that that's not gonna. You know
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:38.960]   Okay, great. Okay, that's good to know. Okay, then the other question that we always get about frequencies
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:45.040]   With animals and this has been going on all this time now. It's like, you know, can we still use?
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:51.120]   Human frequencies for your animals because like just as an example, I have an older dog and a younger dog
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.200]   Younger dogs anxious older dogs kind of like, you know, he's getting old
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:01.760]   So I've been using like inflammation support for my older one and I've been using inner peace on the little one
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.880]   Uh, you know, just because these frequencies just came out today
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.720]   Uh, so and it hasn't seemed to affect them negatively
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:14.080]   So I'm just wondering can we you know as like what's your recommendation on using the human frequencies?
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:21.760]   For animals like I've been doing so long. Yeah. Yeah, so we tested that at some point and we figured that
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:26.480]   Uh, it's not such a good idea to use this human frequency is on the dogs, but
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:35.360]   With the inner peace, I think you were fine using that. It's just now. I would not use any more now that you have the calm
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:41.040]   Right. Um, and the inflammation may be different actually that one. I don't think we tested
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:47.840]   I think that's probably and and you know that one probably better than I do. Yeah, that's why I was I wasn't I didn't
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:52.000]   Yeah, I wasn't hesitate to use it on him because I knew what what's in it
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.520]   Yeah
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.880]   Okay. Yeah, exactly. So then this is maybe a good recommendation. So hey, you know if you feel inflammation
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.960]   Um, then maybe also use this one or use the heel
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.800]   But but in general, I would say, you know
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:13.120]   All the animals are so different. That's why we created also these specific frequencies because they are so different
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.400]   And we could not use the heel frequency for humans
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.960]   On them. It's just it just doesn't work
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:26.960]   Okay, good to know. So yeah, okay. So definitely if you're been using them like I have human frequencies on your pets
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.760]   Uh now that there's animal ones you definitely want to switch to the animal ones. That's the recommendation
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:35.840]   Um, okay. Well great. That's those are primarily the questions I got
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.680]   I'm sure we'll probably get some more as as as these are being
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:45.920]   Utilized and everybody hey, you know what you just got a bunch of new stuff and it's part of your subscriptions
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:51.040]   If you already have them go for it give them a try and and thanks fill up. I just want to say thank you
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:55.600]   Uh for your time today, but also thank you for for doing this
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:01.440]   I mean you've added stuff to to traumise and you've added stuff to quantum upgrade and the price has not changed
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:06.960]   And I just want to say thank you from the community other people have noticed as well that they're getting more and more value
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.160]   And I you know, I just love that about Layla and the fact that you guys are
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:16.320]   focused on adding more value and and not not not jack in the price every time
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.720]   So hey, thanks for that and I just want to say thank you from for every you know from everybody for that
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.120]   That's that's an awesome feature
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:27.440]   Thank you so much. K for doing this. Thank you so much for
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.400]   this great information you're putting out and for always being on top of this and
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.600]   Thank you to the community as well
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:42.640]   And yeah, I hope everyone loves this here and yeah, maybe I should also say right now watch out also for
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:49.360]   A press release that's gonna come out traveling this week, which you hopefully will love everyone
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.840]   most of you have heard about it already, but
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.680]   It's now going to be literally in writing the we have received the report by
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:03.360]   the professor at the university of toolsa who ran the five
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.120]   wound healing studies and
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.080]   Obviously any quantum upgrade user
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:15.120]   Should be excited that this is really coming out now and
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.160]   Yeah, it was shown that
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.840]   overall
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:25.360]   with huge statistical significance because literally tens of millions of cells were
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:30.480]   Were in these studies in the control group and in the treated group
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:37.120]   Showed a 50 percent to 100 percent acceleration and wound healing of actual human cells
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:42.960]   And yeah, that is super exciting and we're happy we'll be able to share with the world now
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:48.880]   Awesome. I'm really looking forward to reading that. I'll definitely make a benefits video on that one
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.600]   Uh, that's exciting. That is really exciting news and that's just quantum upgrade. Wow
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:57.200]   You know, we're defying physics here. That's amazing
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.920]   So, hey, so thank you very much everybody
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.200]   If you're if you're new to quantum upgrade or you want to know more about it
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.480]   Uh quantum upgrade.io is the website address
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.280]   To kind of join the quantum upgrade community. It's on telegram link below in the video description
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:17.200]   Where you could ask questions and you can hear what all the other folks that are trying it are saying about it
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.520]   Uh directly from you know from the customers and not from the company
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:28.400]   So it's a great place to get questions answered and learn more about quantum upgrade is the website as well as the telegram chat group
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.200]   Also, too, if you want to know more about me, uh, you know, i'm at the tinker's academy
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.560]   And that's my blog and you can just you know get that from the link below
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.440]   And also want to remind everybody to that, you know, if you're new to quantum upgrade, there's a seven-day free trial
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:47.360]   So, uh, you can always just give it a try if you haven't tried it before and and uh, it's always available and for seven days
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.560]   You can try the quantum upgrade service. It doesn't include the frequencies
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:56.480]   But you can definitely try the service and see how it works for you. So thank you very much. Uh, any last words
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.240]   Phillip
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.480]   Well, just a big thank you. I'm really grateful for you for the community
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.920]   and
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.760]   Yeah, really happy we we get to
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.160]   just
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:15.760]   Experience these times here together with such a strong field. I'm really happy and grateful also for for everyone that's helping
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.640]   Um, certainly on the team and for Roman and everyone else
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:28.080]   Yeah, great job. So okay. So thank you very much and you guys have a great day. Thanks, Phillip. Thank you
