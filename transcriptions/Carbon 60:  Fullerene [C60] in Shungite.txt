[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Carbon-60 video by me calmer and in this video I'd like to
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.480]   share with you the research that I've done in trying to determine the amount of fullerenes
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:21.280]   and or C-60 carbon-60 in a rock called shungite. It seems like all the people that sell this
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:28.720]   thing called shungite are saying that it's got C-60 in it and I would like to just share with you
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.400]   the science of whether or not it really does. So let's jump right in. The very first step in
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.400]   all of this is to understand the terminology. So if you don't mind I'm just going to do a little
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.880]   bit of terminology, a little bit of geology, and then let jump into the subject matter so that
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.400]   we're all on the same page. So the very first thing to understand is when you say what is fullerene,
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   C-60 and shungite. Let's start with the first word fullerenes. Fullerenes are a carbon allotrope
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.320]   and what that means if you remember from your basic science was carbon is one of the many elements
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.720]   on the periodic table and when you take carbon atoms and you cluster them together in different
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.440]   they come out in different forms. Some of them come out in this amorphous form where they make
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.560]   up the poofy kind of powdery or charcoal kind of carbon and then the other carbon atoms form
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.120]   different structures in a crystalline as opposed to amorphous and the ones that are most popular
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.160]   the ones that you know pretty much everybody recognizes is the graphite in your pencil
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.720]   or the diamonds on your wife's wedding ring. And so those are the types of carbon and they're
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.680]   just pure carbon but it's you take those atoms those carbon atoms and you arrange them in different
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.880]   structures you get different allotropes okay. Now one of the allotropes which is the purpose
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.160]   of this video is going to talk about fullerenes which is a crystalline type of carbon allotrope.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.920]   Fullerenes also are in the same branch of of allotropes as carbon nanotubes so they come
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.920]   either as what is called essentially a caged molecule or I'm sorry caged molecule of carbon
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.920]   or a tube of carbon atoms connected together and that's what's called fullerenes or you know
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.240]   or essentially carbon allotropes but it's it's also a fullerene okay it's one of the carbon
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.280]   allotropes sorry okay so then what are fullerenes okay so now up to as of nowadays there's about
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.280]   39 different types of fullerenes that have been identified by science in the study they're as small
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.560]   as c20 which is 20 carbon atoms clustered together in a form of a of a spherical or you can either
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:49.040]   go elliptical I'm sorry lipsoids tubes and other shapes all the way up to c720 which is 720 carbon
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.080]   atoms clustered together to form a little cage. Now our favorite which is the purpose of my my
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.240]   own entire research and everything that I'm I'm interested in is this specific carbon molecule
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.880]   called carbon 60 which is one of the 39 fullerenes and this is the one that's probably the studied
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.920]   the most it's got the most interesting for you know you know attributes and things like that but
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.160]   yeah I just want to point out and this is very important to this discussion is that there are
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.560]   multiple numbers of fullerenes fullerenes are one of many forms of carbon and within
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:30.000]   fullerenes themselves there are many forms of fullerenes and c60 is just but one of 39 okay
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.520]   and so now we ask yourself well you know what is shungite well shungite essentially is a fossilized
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.960]   organic material of the sea bottom pre cambrian sediments that have a high level of carbon
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.360]   and it's a rock okay and it's a rock made up of the bottom of the sea floor you know a couple
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.400]   billion years ago and then what makes it unique is that it's got a high level of carbon but it's
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.000]   also got silica and silicate mica and other trace minerals it comes in different types I'll get
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.040]   into that more later all the way from type one all the way to type five and these are the when
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   you look at it it's pretty much going to look like these two different types and but it does there's
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.200]   five different types of shungite that exist and then so when you know that's when people are trying
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.760]   to sell it to you they you know that's what it looks like and now in terms of like how old it is
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   and this I get I'm going off on geological nerd chip here because I'm really into this kind of
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.680]   stuff but you know this is a basically a timeline of planet earth and it you know scientifically
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.320]   stating and started about 4.6 billion years ago and then shungite right here formed about 2.0
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.200]   to 2.1 billion years ago and the protorozoa eon which is the largest eon on planet earth and so
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.200]   it kind of it's it's kind of cool the oceans formed after the first snowball earth and then over time
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.240]   basically the planet froze over again and second snowball earth and so forth dinosaurs you know
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.880]   sorry dinosaurs showed up etc and then the first hominids about two million years ago so you could
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.320]   say it was a really long time ago that this ocean existed and over the time and the you know the
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.360]   tectonic plates shifting around on the outside of the earth the crust crunching together it buried
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.000]   that ocean floor underneath the ground and it heated it up and pressure and so forth and it
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.120]   created what we now call shungite and where you find shungite is specifically right here in this
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.600]   area of Russia on the border of Finland and that's where that specific type of rock exists but what
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.160]   I want to point out by this slide and I I found this to be absolutely fascinating because I didn't
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.720]   know this it was was you know the idea of fullerenes in general right having a terrestrial and extra
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.400]   terrestrial origin so if that's of any interest here there's a fascinating paper that was put
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.720]   out by the Department of Earth Sciences at Rice University in Houston called terrestrial and
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.840]   extraterrestrial fullerenes and so you know if you've been in the C60 type of community for a little
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.880]   while you heard you know about a year ago some folks started saying that C60 was a technology and
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.600]   you know all that kind of nonsense right but you know here's a paper that just absolutely dispels
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.560]   any concept of the fact you know that C60 was created I mean it exists on our planet there's 17
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.640]   identified locations on planet earth that fullerenes exist in nature and of course fullerenes exist
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.720]   in the universe and space and so but we're talking about just the one the one right here in the area
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:32.400]   which is called Karelia Russia and so when you take a closer look at that area of Russia like I
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.560]   said it's on the border of Finland between the white sea and the Gulf of Finland and at the northern
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:46.400]   border of a lake called the Lake Onaga okay it's about 60 kilometers north east of St. Petersburg so
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.320]   that's right there that little red dot that is the shungite field from a mindless we talk about
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.160]   geological mining terminology this is their field this is a substrate a map of that field and this
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:05.200]   I got all this from geology type of documentation but it's specifically oh by the way if you don't
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.720]   if you're not familiar with my videos I link everything so you can do all your own research so
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.440]   trust me just read yourself all in the video description there's links to all of these papers
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.400]   okay so knock yourself out I highly recommend people do their own research learn for yourself
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.960]   know what the truth is so forth so anyway so here's a substrate a map of Lake Onaga the northern
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.480]   shore of Lake Onaga by the bay of Provenenski and here's the town of Shunga which is what
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.080]   shungite was named after and then I highlighted these other two all of these little words here
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:40.240]   which I can't pronounce are all other mines that are mining this giant field of shungite
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.920]   underneath the ground and you know in the in the in this paper it talks about this field right here
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:54.880]   holds about two or 20 million tons of shungite is is mineable in this area and right now all of
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:01.200]   these different Russian mines are pulling out about 200,000 tons a year of shungite and they use
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.720]   it for all sorts of different industry types of purposes and different materials and paints and
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.160]   and you name it so it is a pretty valuable rock and that they're able to exploit economically
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:18.000]   and it's it makes up a big deal of the economy in this area so it's a it's a pretty you know
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.320]   it's shungite by itself is a pretty interesting thing I don't want to go too deep into that but
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.520]   it's it's it's it's really interesting to read about but so now these other two mines that I
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:35.680]   highlight right here the conda paga pogab sorry and the zag hogno pogino mines are two of ones
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.600]   that are mentioned in the literature about fullerene so I just wanted to highlight so you can have
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.920]   a visual idea of where shunga is at the northern end of lake onaga and where the mines are where
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:52.000]   people took samples of cc I'm sorry samples of shungite to measure the amount and or detection of
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.720]   fullerenes in these mines so this is where it came from this mine here and this mine here or where
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.120]   the samples came from which is interesting because there hasn't been any I couldn't find papers about
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.640]   that had samples from any other mine other than these two mines and and generally you know in
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:14.000]   general the charelia area so as I mentioned earlier shungite in the literature is considered
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.480]   highly heterogeneous and so what that means is it has more than one phase as it's forming so
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:28.560]   unlike so there's a difference between a carbon allotrope and a heterogeneous you know element of a
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:34.720]   specific type of rocket and what this means particularly is that you can find shungite in five
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.080]   different types and the types have been classified based on the amount of carbon that that type
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.600]   contains okay so that's type one all the way to type five so if you have if the rock has less
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.800]   than or the shungite rock has less than 10 percent carbon it's considered a type five or if it has
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.480]   more than 75 percent carbon it's considered type one and so that's your concept here if it's really
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.080]   low in carbon it looks like this but more carbon it has it actually gets quite crystalline looking
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:08.000]   and very shiny and so that's what that means so that so this is actually kind of important because
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.800]   when scientists start looking at different shungite then it's real important like okay well
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:18.640]   what type of shungite were you looking at to see if the fullerenes existed which begs the question
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.080]   you know are there fullerenes and all of the different types or just one or two types or
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.080]   and so forth and so what's interesting was that the literature does come out and say that they
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.880]   found fullerenes in type one two and three so there is you know fullerenes in these that have
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:36.320]   been detected and so now let's get into the actual reference papers and so I want to point out
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.200]   something I think it's very important is you know after literally a couple of weeks of just some
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.000]   concerted effort I have a day job so concerted effort outside of the day job and on weekends where
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.880]   I'm pulling up papers and researching and reading a lot I found 21 separate papers on the concept
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.800]   and I read them all and I just kind of narrowed it down to there's only five out of 21 papers that
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.680]   really talked about the presence of fullerenes and even more more important which is why what
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:08.720]   I am very interested in was the presence of C60 the one out of 39 right of the fullerenes you know
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.880]   how much of that was in there not just that there was fullerenes but so the fullerenes
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.040]   in Shanghai it kind of narrowed down to five papers and the origins of these five papers come
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.440]   from the International Journal of Advanced Scientific and Technical Research and Geological Society
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.640]   of America National Geophysical Research Institute in India and the Indian Institute of Chemical
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:32.560]   Technology and also to the St. Petersburg State University in St. Petersburg so there was five
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:40.400]   out of 21 papers that actually even gave me or anyone a glimpse of the concept of fullerenes in
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.680]   Shungite and so here are the basically the results that I extracted from those papers
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.800]   though there are links to all of those papers you know everyone is welcome full transparency I'm
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.480]   not trying to disrupt the Shungite market or anything but I want to just be really really
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:03.040]   transparent very clear and very honest scientifically accurate about this okay and the reason why it's
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.920]   important is you'll see at the end of the video so the very first paper and you know I did number
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.840]   them so they're numbered right here so I don't go you know it's just there's not enough room on the
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:18.400]   on the slide to put the name of the paper so paper one they went to the zag, oh no I'm sorry I
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:25.520]   just can't pronounce that ah if you're Russian I apologize okay so they looked at type three
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:32.480]   Shungite and the results were and it was right there in the paper that they did detect that
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:40.800]   were fullerenes content in their sample and it was anywhere from 0.01 to 0.0001 percent
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:46.560]   of the sample and they looked at it through a transmission electron microscope and they were
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:53.680]   able to detect that the size of the particulates of fullerenes were anywhere between 10 and 30
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:13:00.480]   nanometers in size and that's sort of important because if you know your science that you'll know
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:08.800]   that C60 molecule is approximately one nanometer in size but you know right that it does cluster
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:15.360]   together in crystals or clusters that could be anywhere from 10 to 300 or bigger I mean way
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:20.240]   bit way way bigger where you can literally see it with the naked eye you cannot see one molecule C60
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.440]   without an electron microscope but you can see clusters of them in the hundreds and hundreds
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:32.960]   of nanometers but but so this is this size is the fullerenes okay and and so they so paper number
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:38.320]   one is they discovered or the end they detected that hey there's fullerenes in here they did not
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:44.480]   look for C60 they just said there are fullerenes so they don't you don't you don't know how many of
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.920]   the 39 or which ones of the 39 you just know that there were fullerenes in that sample their paper
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:56.720]   number two did not specify which exact mind they basically said they took type 2 changai based on
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.920]   the description of the carbon content from the area of chorilla and they studied it and this
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.160]   second paper I mean was from the geological society of America okay and they went and said
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.840]   we find this is right out of the paper we find no evidence of fullerenes in changai sample from
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:18.960]   various locations all right and so they didn't find anything the third one was the mine in condo
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.960]   paga sorry condo poga which I think is how you pronounce it they studied type one and two and
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   another study was type one the first one was out of 12 chorilla and changai samples we found
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:36.880]   fullerenes in only three samples of all of which were bright changai of glassy nature which is
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:41.920]   obviously type one so they looked at type one and two and they only found three out of 12
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:48.880]   and of course all three were found in type one and then the same individuals that did that study
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:54.960]   also mentioned in another study that were they studied for c60 and this is what was interesting
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:02.640]   these the gentlemen that did this this was actually this paper here number three was a response to
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.480]   this paper here so they put out somebody put out this paper these guys wrote a response and then
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.920]   they did their own study when they did their own study now they actually went looking for c60 and
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:19.600]   this is the only paper I could find that even actually tested for c60 and it was just the one and
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:26.160]   basically their response their their results were that then and they state state this in their paper
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:33.680]   the mass spectrum of the carbonaceous material from changai samples shows peaks corresponding to c60
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:39.360]   and then they also took the the material which is the crushed changai right and they dissolved it in
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:45.600]   benzene and they used a magnetic renaissance spectrum and it exhibited a clear peak at 143.2
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:52.400]   parts per million corresponding to the full right c60 structure now because it was the only one
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:57.680]   that even got close to even trying to identify so I I pulled it out of the paper I just wanted
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.360]   you to see what their graphite you know their their graphics showed this is out of paper number
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:10.720]   four and this is just the you know basically condopogifying acrelia and they ran it through the
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:17.600]   mass spec of the electron ionization mass spec okay and they did find fullerenes and they were
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:22.480]   able to identify and this is what's critical and this is this is what's really cool is that they
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.480]   detected actually detected c60 you know one of the 39 fullerenes they actually detected it because
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:35.440]   they went looking for it and that 720 mole and that's the weight of a c60 molecule so when they saw
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:41.600]   that they confirmed that it existed in natural fullerenes okay and so and then again they went
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.920]   they melted it I'm sorry they dissolved it in benzene and they measured the parts per million
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.200]   of the of the sample in benzene and they came out with this number and this number is a corresponding
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:57.440]   to fullerenes c60 structure so I want to stop for a second here and I noted this I just highlighted
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:04.320]   this word here natural fulleren the fullerenes c60 structure that does not mean that it is c60
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:11.440]   it means fullerenes is another word for saying fullerenes or when you have a sample of a you know
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:17.600]   carbon sample and there are multiple different types of fullerenes in the sample that sample is
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:24.320]   called fullerenes okay and so is they were testing fullerenes they were testing a mass of fullerenes
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:30.880]   and they detected c60 in one of those samples so that's fascinating and so that was paper number
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.320]   four so you know so now we've got some confirmations of there is they've detected fullerenes
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.560]   they've detected c60 but then there's other papers here right at the same time saying that
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.440]   they didn't and then I've actually read other papers where they looked at my like meteorites
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.440]   and one group of scientists said yeah there's fullerenes on this meteorite and another group of
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.200]   scientists looked at the same you know of you know area and they pulled out their samples and
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.400]   they said there's no you know that there's no fullerenes on that meteorite so
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:03.520]   it's a huge depends it really depends on what area what type of shungite and so forth or what mine
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:09.040]   you know whether or not you know the scientists found fullerenes so it's a big depends it's not
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.680]   one it's not every single time you're gonna find fullerenes that's that's pretty much it now the
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:20.960]   fifth paper they didn't even study a sample it just was a bunch of really super smart guys using
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:30.800]   quantum chemical calculations and based on how atoms and carbon behave and within the confines of
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:38.480]   the other atoms and different molecules within shungite they calculated whether or not c60 could
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:44.240]   exist in its its a very interesting paper and it's a lot of math but basically they come out in
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.720]   their conclusion and they state a collective character of the self-organization of carbon
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:56.480]   molecules into aromatic structure is indicated by coinciding energies of formation of c60 molecules
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:03.280]   you know and basically they said yeah it's you know it's possible and based on the math and the only
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.440]   reason I include that is because I couldn't find any more than this this was all I could find that
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.320]   would even talk about whether or not it really is in there or not in there in their meanings
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:18.960]   fullerenes and or c60 in a rock called shungite so let's talk about that for a second
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:24.800]   so this is what I learned number one was that you know all studies focused on the presence of
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:31.440]   fullerenes not c60 and that is such a very important point to me they went looking and they
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.160]   said hey we found some of these but they didn't say how many of this how much it weighed what
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.840]   percent of the sample was just this but as we found an existence or the presence of all of the you know
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:49.120]   quote they found fullerenes they did not get into finding c60 except for that one paper and that one
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:55.840]   paper I want to say right here that it was only detected it was not measured they did not quantify
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.360]   you know like what percent of every sungite you see in the world is going to have six no
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.520]   they just detected it and they primarily detect and scientists primarily detected
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:10.240]   see our fullerenes in type one there's that one other one that detected you know fullerenes in type
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.600]   three but primarily all if you read them all they primarily found it in type one not all of them
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:22.400]   so it really really really depends what type of shungite we're talking about when you talk about
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:27.920]   fullerenes and you talk about c60 but again the presence of fullerenes does not mean you know
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.960]   that's 39 different kinds it does not mean that there's a presence of c60 there there's no
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:39.520]   quantifiable statement and c60 was not found it was detected which is a big difference right
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.440]   and then also too you know they just want to point out again that I was unable and I read a
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:50.400]   lot of stuff and I you know obviously there's probably way way more out there yeah I only have
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:56.960]   so much time that's why this is I want to quantify my conclusion by saying that I was just unable
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:03.840]   to find any study that measured the quantity of specifically c60 in a sample of shungite and if
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.720]   you find one I would love to read it so if you find one you know about a study like that please
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.880]   let me know I would love to read that and then do a follow-up to this video okay
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.920]   so you know that's just how that's as far as I could go with this
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:22.640]   and then lastly of the one paper which is the paper right here that basically measured
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:27.840]   the actual percentage of fullerenes which is the paper here from the international journal
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.960]   of advancing scientific and technical research where they actually measured the amount this is
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.560]   what's so important right it means like it's one thing to say oh I detected something but it's
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.200]   another thing to say I actually measured the amount in the sample and their measurement
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:46.240]   stated that there was one gram of shungite powder inside of one gram of shungite powder
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:55.120]   and had an estimated 0.01 percent to 0.001 percent which is like if you looked at it as a gram it's
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:03.440]   like 0.001 or never mind I'm just going off on a test sorry okay of okay this was important though
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:13.040]   of fullerene content not C60 content fullerene so if it's 0.01 let's just be you know let's say
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.760]   from the the guys who are trying to sell all this stuff to everybody okay let's just be really
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:27.040]   generous to you and say okay you're right there is C60 detected but it's but it's 0.01 percent so
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:36.800]   you know that a percent is 0.01 right so if it's 0.01 percent it's 0.001 right grams per whatever
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:43.840]   right of fullerene but here's the thing it's a fullerene content there's 39 different fullerenes
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:50.000]   there's no mention in that paper that well how much of it was this so let's say okay you know we
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.840]   could you know I don't want to actually I don't even want to speculate how many of these were there
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:59.920]   they measured that there was fullerenes but there's no idea of how much was of of that was C60 you
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:07.520]   know that there's 39 fullerenes so it could be 139th of 0.001 grams you know that kind of thing so I just
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:16.000]   want to conclude this video by stating all right let's be scientifically honest and let's take this
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.880]   number and say if it's fullerenes then we know that C60 is a fraction of the fullerene content
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:28.160]   right if you have fullerenes you have a fraction of that so a fraction of this number you take it
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:34.080]   to the you know how far down these zeros do you have and let's round up and let's answer the question
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.240]   but before I do that I just forgot I wanted to mention something you know a couple of weeks
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:45.040]   ago I was on Facebook and I was kind of interacting with an individual who was talking about C60 in
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:51.680]   his shung-out water and I kind of just pointed out I shared a paper with him that said you know C60
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:57.360]   doesn't exist in water and it's not really healthy for you and then Chris Burris jumped in as a
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.240]   fascinating Chris Burris if you don't know who he is he's one of the founders of SES research
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:08.800]   this guy they they started their company in 1991 and they actually worked with the graduate
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:15.520]   students who were were basically working under smalley and kroto were the scientists who discovered
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:24.000]   C60 in 86 and had gotten the Nobel Science Prize in 1996 for their discovery these are Nobel-winning
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.520]   scientists and the graduate students that helped them with that discovery Chris Burris worked with
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:36.720]   those individuals and when they first decided to commercialize the production of C60 for the
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:42.320]   academics that would then start studying it and then further on into developing it for for
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:50.000]   commercialization and industry and so Chris Burris goes way back he's a 660 scientist times you know
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.560]   a thousand right and so he jumps in on this conversation which was amazing to me and he goes
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:00.560]   and he tells this guy right he goes hey shung-out was proven to not contain C60 by Dr. Smalley's group
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:06.480]   now Dr. Smalley was the guy who was one of the three scientists who got a Nobel Prize in science
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:12.720]   for their discovery of C60 and he goes on to say you know this is this is this is yeah you know this
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:18.000]   is from the source right if my memory serves me correctly and we're all hoping that you know Chris
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.600]   takes a lot of C60 so he's probably proud of pretty sharp memory but if his memory serves me
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.520]   correctly they tested samples on three separate occasions samples of shung-ai this is what we
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:32.720]   were talking about because they really hoped there was C60 in shung-ai and and they didn't find any
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:39.040]   that there was proven not to contain so Smalley's own group the people who discovered C60 went
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:44.800]   looking for C60 in shung-ai they didn't do a paper on it it's just this story that came out of the
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:50.960]   lab and they did not find any okay that's that's remarkable I mean I wish I could have you know
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:56.080]   they would wrote this down and I could add it to this but I've got it like a witness here that
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.280]   basically said hey they they couldn't find it and so so now I'm gonna get back to this right here so
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:08.400]   if there's point of there's a estimated 0.01 percent of fullerenes and there's an estimated
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:14.560]   within every batch of fullerenes or you know fullerenes there's you might have one out of 39
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:20.560]   different types so let's just be generous and say okay it's you know point of this number it's a
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:25.760]   fraction of that number and science what do you do in science well you round up right you can't you
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:31.040]   know you want to be scientifically accurate and so the definition of scientifically accurate is as
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:36.640]   well how many decimal points do you want to round up to to just basically state whether or not
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.600]   something isn't is exists in a sample or not and so I'm going to say hey well you know let's just
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:46.480]   I'm going to be out there and just speculate if it's a fraction of this 0.01 you add a few more
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.200]   zeroes because you don't know what were the contents of the fullerenes and there was some C60
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:55.280]   in there but if it was more like this we'll just take this in let's say if it's this number right
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:00.640]   here okay it's that this is the amount of the you know let's just guess that of the fullerenes
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:06.640]   there was some C60 and at the end of the day there's this much C60 0.001 all right so then what do you
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:12.800]   do when you publish your paper well most people will then round up you round up the number to give
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.280]   you the number that you're going to want to claim in your paper that says this is how much of this
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:24.160]   stuff is in this other stuff right so here you go this is my conclusion for discussion okay as of
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.720]   what I know today with all the material that I've read up to now okay so I do reserve the right
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:34.800]   to change my my conclusion with more data but the question that I want to answer here for everybody
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.720]   based on everything that I've just conveyed to you and all the material that I've linked to that you
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:48.800]   can look at yourself is there C60 in shungite and I will say that there is approximately 0.00 percent
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:57.280]   C60 in shungite and that is a scientifically accurate statement based on the material in the
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   science literature for this topic and there you go that's the answer there is none uh at least
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:11.520]   there is 0.00 all right so that's it so that's the conclusion and I would love to be proven wrong
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:17.280]   but there that's all I can find and then that you know that anyone has ever proven all right so
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.320]   so now one other thing I do want to get into before I close up and I just want to talk
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.640]   about shungite water a little bit because over here you know you see right here at the very end of
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:33.360]   of Chris's post he also says additionally C60 is not water soluble because this gentleman
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:40.560]   was convinced that when he put shungite in water that he was drinking C60 water right and so Chris
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:47.920]   is you know being Chris and he's trying to help the guy additionally C60 is not water soluble so
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:55.040]   you can put Piers C60 crystals in water and you will not transform that body of water instantly
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:00.960]   into C60 fullerenes in other words you put it in water even if you have Piers C60 you put it in
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:07.440]   water it's not going to do you any good all right because it's not water soluble so now I went
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.040]   looking for some literature on the subject I want to add it to the end of the video and I just want
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:18.240]   to share so here are two studies on C60 I'm sorry shungite water okay one from St.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:23.360]   Petersburg State University in Russia St. Petersburg Russia and another Russian paper from the
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:29.200]   Institute of Geology and the Corellian Research Center so these are two Russian scientific papers
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:35.360]   from Russia about one is about the chemical composition of extracts from shungite and
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:41.680]   shungite water and the extraction of fullerenes from shungite carbon by water containing solvents
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:48.160]   all right so when you have when you put shungite in water are you drinking C60 water well okay that
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.520]   answers that but okay let's just get into it a little bit more okay all right so let's take a
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.840]   look at these two papers and you'll know why I'm telling you this the first one St.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.240]   Petersburg State University this is right out of the paper go look it up there's a link below
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.920]   the interaction of ground shungite with water gives a solution with rather high concentrations
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:13.040]   of a number of micro elements including heavy metals the concentrations of micro components and
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:20.240]   aqueous extracts from shungite three are rather high and frequency and frequently exceed the maximum
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:26.960]   permissible concentrations for potable and household water this is Russian these are the
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:32.160]   Russians telling the other Russians don't drink this stuff okay it's not even it's
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:37.520]   it's beyond the acceptable limits for health and you know this is what's important about this and
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:42.320]   let me jump into this one before I get into that from the Institute of Geology Corellian Research
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:48.240]   Center comparative analysis of extracts obtained in shungite carbon that's what that's what this
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:55.760]   symbol means and C60 FWS which means a donor acceptor complex is a fullerenan water so that's
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:02.400]   fullerenan water fullerenes now C60 fullerenes which I don't you know I don't even know what that
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:09.600]   really means but fullerenes and N60 maybe lead to a supposition that fullerenes and shungite carbon
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:18.160]   are presented mainly in the form of chemical derivatives and strong molecular complexes
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:26.720]   all right so translation it's a chemical derivative of a C60 fulleren and what that means is it's not
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:34.800]   just C60 it's C60 with other atoms attached to it like oxygen hydrogen silica and it changes it
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:40.800]   once you add any add you add an extra atom to C60 of something else it's not C60 anymore it's
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.680]   something else okay so these guys are saying that when you put it in water and we tested it you
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.880]   there is you don't get pure C60 it will like he's basically saying this right here in very simple
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:57.280]   ways it's not going to become C60 water it doesn't it becomes something else like you know polyhydroxylated
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:01.280]   or you know that kind of stuff it gets off into all these different other molecules but they're
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:10.080]   not molecules of C60 which is my point now this is my last point on this thing as I mentioned earlier
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:16.560]   that the karelian region pumps out you know 200,000 tons of this stuff a year it is the basis of
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:22.160]   their economy in that region it is a big deal that they have a lot of economy a lot of money a
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:29.920]   lot of people's working lives at stake about whether or not C60 sorry shungite is you know is a valuable
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:37.200]   rock and used in industry and it is okay so there's a huge economic incentive right to promote this
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:41.200]   thing so that the world wants to buy more right you know I mean that's just clear right it's it's
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:46.480]   we're let's all be adults this is you know sometimes science does not necessarily I represent the
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:52.400]   best interest of science when money is involved right especially at the at that level so what's
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:58.320]   comes is really shocking to me is that there's two Russian papers that basically say not good
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.800]   doesn't have it you know doesn't have C60 and don't drink it okay and that's what was really
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.200]   surprising what these these are Russian papers these are Russian and St. Petersburg University
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:12.080]   is highly renowned you know so so there you go if the Russians themselves are saying
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:20.560]   that shungite water is not not good and especially not good but not not healthy for you I just want
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:26.960]   to really point that out for all of you guys who believe that C60 is or the shungite has C60 in it
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:31.440]   and for all of you that believe that drinking shungite water is healthy for you the Russians
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:36.720]   themselves are telling you that it's not so I also just I really just please exercise caution
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:42.880]   because you know we're all in this together and uh the science says you know this is probably
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:49.040]   not a good idea all right shungite water or believing anybody that says this load of BS right here
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:55.520]   which is and this is please exercise caution if if anything in my research that's more alarming
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:02.240]   to me than anything else was I went on eBay I typed in the words C60 shungite and this kind of BS
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:09.760]   showed up this guy here selling C60 for that literally C60 for olive oil or olive coconut oil
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.960]   genuine high quality natural fluorine okay that couldn't be a bigger load of BS based on what I
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:20.960]   just told you and all of the science material on the subject this one here shungite powder
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:28.160]   Corellian stone full-range C60 pure powder C60 pure powder oh really oh really did we not read
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:36.160]   the paper so you know this is a absolute false advertising scam people are buying this crap
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:43.840]   probably adding it to oil and poisoning themselves with what heavy metals so um
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:50.800]   please don't do that I just it just I just feel bad when I think that people are actually doing
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:57.680]   that so it's it's it's alarming to me so anyway I just you know that's that so please exercise caution
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:02.800]   um and I just one last thing I went looking at this one this guy has a website and he claims that
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:09.200]   he has a patent you know and he claims that he's got a safety data sheet on on this product
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.840]   so you know I looked at the patent and the patent has nothing to do with C60 it's a patent for
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:18.640]   grinding shungite stone into powder and looked at a safety data sheet on his website
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:27.040]   it was a safety data sheet for the use of shungite as a um as an additive to mattress linings for
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:34.720]   beds it had nothing to do with safety for you know for ingestion it was just complete BS so yeah you
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:39.920]   know um yeah enough on that I'm sorry I went on a tangent but it's personal to me you know I don't
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:45.920]   want you guys see anyone I anyone of you guys get sick so that's it here's the answer there's
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:52.240]   approximately 0.00 percent C60 shungite an absolutely accurate scientific statement thank
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:59.440]   you thank you for staying with me on this video and learning with me as I go along in my journey
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:05.040]   to know more about C60 um I hope that this put this to rest I hope you guys can link it to your
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:10.240]   friends who who may who think that who think the opposite don't fall for the marketing
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:19.200]   hyperbowl it's just that it's the truth is is the truth okay it's it's the zero zero zero zero
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:26.000]   so thank you for your time it is valuable and I do appreciate it very much thank you for your
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:33.840]   kind comments I hope you have a great week and just you know aloha have a great day bye
