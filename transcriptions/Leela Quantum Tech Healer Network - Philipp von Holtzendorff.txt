[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Hello everyone and welcome to another Layla quantum tech video.
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.540]   And in today's video, I've got the pleasure of speaking with
[00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.040]   Philip one Holtsendorf. How are you doing, Philip?
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.480]   Hi, K. I'm doing great. How are you?
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.960]   I'm doing awesome. Hey, you know, this video is the one where I've
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.680]   talked Philip into getting interviewed himself as one of the
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.920]   healers of the Layla healer network. And so for those of you
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.760]   who aren't familiar, if you go to the Layla quantum tech
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.360]   website, and you click on this little little word here called
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.720]   healers, the thing that I like to point out to people all the
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.440]   time is that Layla quantum tech is a is a collaboration of
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.360]   different gifted and talented healers all around the planet.
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.960]   And Philip's one of them. And so what Philip had done on his
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.640]   YouTube channel was he started interviewing each one of them
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.080]   kind of just introduced them to the to the Layla community. But
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.560]   you know, but who's going to interview him? Right? So I
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.560]   decided to take it upon myself to interview Philip as one of the
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.320]   healers of the healer network and just talk about him as a
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.200]   healer. So Philip, thanks for for encouraging my my idea here.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.760]   Because I thought it'd be a really kind of a nice thing for
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.120]   people to, you know, meet you as well as as one of the healers
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.160]   in the network. So hey,
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.960]   well, thanks for that idea to to to bring that up. I never
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.480]   thought about that. And that on that level, I try to stay in the
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.360]   background. But you know, when you when you asked me, it felt
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.600]   right to do it. So
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.520]   Yeah, well, you know, as I was looking at the websites of the
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.200]   other healers, it was really interesting. I found that some
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.320]   of them were just born that way. Others had acquired it as a
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.400]   skill. You know, and then and you know, basically, everybody's
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400]   different. But at one point in their life, they just kind of
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.360]   just like a light bulb goes off. And they switch from whatever
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.600]   they're doing. And they start really focusing on honing their
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.720]   skills as a healer. And then they just get better and better
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.000]   and better at it. And to which on all of these individuals here
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.120]   pictured on the website are all really well recognized healers
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.360]   in their own right with with their own followings and their own
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.440]   websites and everything. So and then of course, there's you
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.320]   right. So I yeah, I just really wanted to start off with the
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.680]   first question is you as a healer is and this is the same
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.880]   question you posed to your other healers when you were
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.800]   interviewing them, which is, you know, what what was that spark
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.360]   of light for you? I mean, I know that used to be like me right
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.240]   now, you know, white collar, you know, C suite, you know, person
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.840]   in a big industry, you know, telecom industry for you. But
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.280]   you know, but then now like years later, you know, completely
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.960]   180 opposite from being a white collared suit in a high rise.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.880]   So, you know, what was that spark of light for you that said,
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.080]   Hey, you know, this is not this is not what I want. And I
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.080]   want to be a healer.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.760]   Yeah. So I was not one of the ones that was born with this. And
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.880]   then probably I wouldn't have ended up in corporate anyway.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.360]   But yeah, so that that was just my path though. And I think in
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.760]   early 2000s, really 2001 ish, I started to figure out that
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.920]   there's more and I started to become interested in this whole
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:32.080]   topic of energy work yoga and I started reading some books
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.400]   about it and I started to try meditation and try some yoga.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.040]   That's where it all started, if you will, and I was at a place at
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.800]   that time where I felt, okay, it's there's something missing,
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.760]   like, you know, I work all the time and I really don't feel
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.800]   that good. I wasn't a happy person, I must say, I was in a
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.160]   relationship and the relationship was pretty good and
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.240]   everything. But at core, I wasn't happy. So something was
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.680]   missing. And I think that was the driver to to figure out, okay,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.520]   you know, how can I be more happy? And I didn't even
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.960]   consciously do that, I think it just happened. And then certain
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.440]   things happened that I found a flyer somewhere about an open
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.640]   door of, you know, one of those centers where they offered a
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.640]   chukra course. And I was like, Hey, yeah, you know, I didn't
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.160]   even really think about it. And I went there and then they
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.040]   offered a course to talk about what the chukras are and the
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.960]   different qualities of it. I was like, wow, I had no idea that
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.760]   this exists. And I even had doubts that you know, that's even
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.320]   true what they're talking about. But that was kind of where it
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.640]   really all started. But then I got more interested and I felt
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.360]   like, wow, you know, this is this stuff that is real and it's
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.000]   and it's working as I did a few works actually to work on some
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.400]   of the own blockages and difficulties that I had in my
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.320]   life. And I felt, okay, now I wanted to actually really do
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.160]   more of that work. And at the same time, really learn how I can
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.600]   do these things on my own. And never I did not at all have the
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.480]   desire to to learn that to really truly help other people
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.640]   with that. For me, it was like, I had my career, but I want to do
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.160]   heal myself. And I wanted to learn that so that I can apply
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.200]   it for myself. And while I'm learning it, I was figuring,
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.240]   well, then I'm releasing a lot of those blockages and
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.320]   transforming my own being in a way. And that's kind of what I
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.280]   did fast forward. I, you know, aside from my business career, I
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.480]   went through multiple of such trainings, like shamanic
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.440]   trainings, past life regression work, and all kinds of stuff
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:05.280]   like that. So yeah, and it really did that. It helped me to open
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.600]   up. However, it was a little bit of a struggle for a while,
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.760]   because it took some time to get through things. And it really
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.240]   isn't the easiest path either, because if you're suddenly
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.160]   starting to face your shadows, that's a great thing. Because I
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.880]   mean, that's the most wonderful thing we can do, I think I can
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.080]   recommend it to everyone. Because in the end of the day, you
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.160]   become more free, and you become more connected and you find out
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.520]   more who you are and why you're here for. But it isn't an easy
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.000]   path. Because that's one of the difficulties. And that's one
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   of the reasons why people don't turn inwards is actually
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.600]   because they're scared of what's inside. Well, we don't need to
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   be scared. And that's what I figured out also at some point.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.600]   But yeah, so that was in a nutshell, you know, my path and
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.160]   at some point, things really turned where a lot of the things
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.240]   I did culminated in, okay, now when I actually worked with
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.000]   someone, I could see everything that I needed to see in order to
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   help them. Now I'm talking not really about physical diseases
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.080]   or something like that. I'm talking rather about really deep
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.680]   energetic lockages, whether, you know, someone has just these
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.760]   repeating patterns that keep them totally unhappy or there's
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.760]   they're always freaking out about something, you know, there's
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.840]   lots, thousands of examples, but really releasing that finding
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.800]   the core of why that is going to that route and then transforming
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.680]   that energetic root course cause, if you will, that is something
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.280]   I became super, super easy to do actually.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.960]   Okay, so she kind of went on a journey of self discovery, and
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.240]   then all of a sudden you'd started to help others do the same,
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:08.760]   right? You know, sort of, yes, and, and, and, you know, I started
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.320]   to also work with clients, but it still never was what I really
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.840]   wanted to do. And even today, every now and then I do have a
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.960]   client and it's, it's actually fun. And I always feel great when
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:29.720]   I do that work, I really love to do it. But yeah, I think my, my
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.640]   path was really to, to use that knowledge that I've gained and
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:41.800]   myself discovery to now help create these products to help
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.760]   people and to, to bring in other healers as well.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.280]   Yeah, no, that's, that makes a lot of sense. I mean, we all have
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.040]   our own various outlets for how to help other people. I didn't
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.240]   think of it that way. That's a really good way to think of it.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.920]   You know, as part of your healing journey and we're all still
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.560]   learning, right? You once described yourself as a shaman. So
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.600]   is that something that's self taught? Or did you kind of
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.880]   like mentor under an actual shaman? And, and can you talk a
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.800]   little bit more about that? Because I think that's one of the
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.160]   very fascinating things about Philip.
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.760]   Yeah, so it's not self taught, even though after I learned a lot
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.760]   of the mechanisms and how to use the drums and various other
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.640]   tools, etc, to change vibrational energy and then, you know,
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.080]   actually go very deep on journeys with people and, and help
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.280]   them. I'm not talking about plant medicine or anything right
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.600]   now, though, because I really work just energetically, and not
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.360]   with with any plant medicine. Unless maybe some smudging, you
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.680]   know, that there will be something. But I really learned
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.320]   that in courses, in various shamanic courses. So I've worked
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.200]   a lot with some shamans and people that trained other
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.040]   shamans. And yeah, what I learned there at some point, then I
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.800]   refined with my own energy, because in the end of the day,
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.880]   you can learn a lot of tools, a lot of how to do it and how to
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.760]   access the knowing, if you will, the spirit. But then it comes
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.000]   down to what is needed in a given moment, and that can look
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.840]   completely different. Like you, you may have the jump, but you
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.360]   may beat it in a completely different way. So that that is
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.320]   very important, that you have that flexibility and just do
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.120]   what is needed in the moment. And that then came through more
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.000]   practice. Okay, so you know, I know that you live in the
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.520]   Southwest USA. So is, is the shamanism more like centralized
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.400]   like, like American First Nations people? Or is there like more
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.720]   like South American? I mean, is there a difference? Do you feel
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.080]   and you know, because you're talking about, well, there's
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.840]   you know, the folks that use plants, but then the ones that
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.640]   are focused on frequency and energy, is that something as
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.360]   unique to, to like the the South, you know, the Southwest Indian
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.800]   tribes, when you talk about shamanism, or are you talking
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.880]   about oriental shamanism? So there are multiple different
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:18.240]   right, tribes and versions. And, and I think I've, I've tapped
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:25.200]   into multiple of those and learned the essence of it. But I
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.440]   wanted to make sure people understand that I'm not, you
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.680]   know, shaman working with you with plant medicine. So don't call
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.440]   me or text me and say, Hey, I want to do plan is like, I don't
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.760]   do these things. You have to go to someone else. Ideally, maybe
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.360]   to the South American jungle somewhere. And I'm not saying
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.880]   this cannot be great that, you know, there's some definitely
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:50.280]   some plant medicine out there that can be if used correctly.
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:56.440]   And, you know, rarely, very rarely, it can be very, very
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.880]   powerful. But that's really not what I've worked on. And I
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.000]   don't, I don't think it's, it's specific to the area here. I
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.640]   think there are several tribes that work with a lot of, you
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.120]   know, energy and frequency. And, you know, I think all of them
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:16.240]   work with drum drums, all of them work with feathers, ones that
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.720]   I've encountered.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.880]   Yeah, it's definitely sound, or the sound slash frequency,
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.280]   right? mixed in with the energy work. That's, that's, that's
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.000]   what I've seen. So, I'm, you know, I'm curious to, to kind of
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.200]   hear when you were mentioning that you were actually doing
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.000]   hands-on healing work, was that at like a phase between, you
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.480]   know, in your learning journey and then starting Layla.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.280]   Yeah, because I know that you also do this path of love, and
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.120]   you do webinars with people go to in use, and you don't know
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.000]   if you still do the retreats path of love retreats. But is
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.480]   that, you know, because I'm just, I guess, you know, you do
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.920]   so many different things. And so my question is, is like, you
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.040]   know, what was that journey like that ended up being where the
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:05.560]   focus of your time is frequency and energy, whereas, you know,
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.600]   there's so many different practices, right? You were
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.760]   talking about the yoga, the meditation, the, you know, you've
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.720]   got the the reiki folks that are doing right, right, the Reiki
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.920]   Reiki, you know, you're doing those kinds of works, you've got
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.560]   people that are doing sound healing with Tibetan bowls. I
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.160]   mean, there's so many amazing things that can tie into the
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.480]   concept of healing and all the different healers of the
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.440]   network do different things. I mean, here's a picture of, you
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.680]   have Insha, which is, you know, the drums, right? So, you
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.400]   know, how did you end up with focusing in on like quantum
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.360]   energy? And, you know, and and the frequency work, and as as a
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.360]   very specific, you know, thing to do. I mean, what was that
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.760]   like? And what what led to that?
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.360]   Yeah, so first of all, the work that I described that I do with
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.840]   others, that was always on the side that was never at any point
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.560]   in my life, my main focus. Okay. That was really on the side
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.040]   and even the seminars and retreats that crew Roman and I
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.400]   together gave, including webinars, that's that's always
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.160]   something that's kind of like on the side. We had right when
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.240]   COVID, the COVID stuff started, we had a big seminar here in
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.720]   our land, actually the three of us together. And then, you know,
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.000]   it was very, very difficult to travel, you know, for for
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.680]   people here, but then especially also for Roman to come over
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:35.120]   here from Europe. So that's why we haven't done since that time,
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.000]   a physical retreat. But we'll definitely do that again. But
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.600]   it hasn't been the time yet. So like that we don't we work
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.720]   when there's an impulse to do it, then we we talk about it and
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.680]   then we'll create it. But it hasn't been an impulse yet. In
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:56.320]   terms of webinars, we continue to do that. And yeah, when, you
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.400]   know, with a with a quantum healing and frequency, you know,
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:08.080]   in 2016, I got out of corporate completely and started doing
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:13.520]   really what I felt called to do. And what I felt is kind of like
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.520]   the next thing and working from these impulses, if you will, and
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.240]   not from, you know, someone telling me what I need to do
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:25.480]   today and next few days. And even if you're like a high level
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.920]   executive, you always have someone that has specific
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:34.840]   expectations and things that didn't really fit me anymore. And
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:44.520]   yeah, so we realized that there is a lot of healers out there
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.480]   that do amazing work. And yes, there's also Reiki and the
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.320]   Reiki is frankly, it's like really on the bottom of the scale
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.840]   for me, because it's really the easiest. It's the less least
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.920]   impactful, frankly, I don't want to offend anyone. But it
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:03.520]   really is like even like long 10 year Reiki masters that, you
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.880]   know, are actually awesome and what they do. I mean, they go
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:11.160]   to Agni and then they started zero and they're like, okay, well,
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.280]   now I really learn what's going on. So there's there's huge
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:19.360]   scale of, you know, yeah, healing modalities, but then up to
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.960]   level where you're like a really impactful healer that can move
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:33.120]   worlds literally. But the what fascinated me was when I bumped
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.880]   into obviously some different energy devices, energy tools,
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.080]   and there's a lot of this stuff out there, right? Even
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.120]   crystals, I had been really interested in crystals. And
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:52.040]   then the attempts to have quantum technology and working
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.360]   with frequencies and all of that. But all not well executed
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.200]   because if there's a disharmony created at the same time,
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:06.360]   while you're trying to solve something, that's by itself not
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:11.440]   a good execution of something. And it and it sounds great. And
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.880]   yes, they're it's already quite cool and nice if there's
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.400]   quantum energy in it. But if it's very little and it causes
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:25.880]   energetic distress, it's not great. So obviously, for for me
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:31.360]   at the time, it was then the moment to speak with Roman and
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:37.040]   also with crew and and we were looking into, okay, so shall we
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.480]   do something here that is really powerful and is fully
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.800]   harmonious with the human cells, etc. And the clear answer
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.760]   was always yes, because we didn't just do it. It was, you
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.800]   know, okay, so what are we going to do is this is the right
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.040]   thing to do. How are we going to do it? And then we started
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:03.320]   the creation of it. And yeah, all that that came out of it is
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.000]   now what we have available, what you can see on the website and
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.440]   you know, the products you can touch and check out and that
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.640]   have been tested. And yeah, it was very clear that it shouldn't
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.880]   be just us, we should involve some of the other healers because
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.680]   they have different qualities. And what I've learned also is
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:28.000]   that there isn't the one healer that can do it all. And
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.880]   there's also not the one healer that's the right one for
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:36.960]   everyone. And there's also not the healer that really sees it
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.160]   all on that level, because I, you know, from my perspective,
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.520]   there are there's so many different levels, right? We have
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.440]   this physical material, then we have the energetic and we have
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.320]   the big picture and all of that. But still, even on that big
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:54.400]   picture, one healer may look at this with a more focus on this
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.320]   and another one on that. And so even today, sometimes I'm being
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.080]   asked by other healers, you know, here I saw that you can help
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.280]   with the word for my client. And and and and that's an amazing
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.720]   healer because they see, well, okay, there's something that
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:18.000]   someone else is the right one to solve or to work with. You
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.720]   don't have to do it all yourself. And you shouldn't because
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.200]   sometimes you're just not the right one. And that's why we've
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:30.400]   included some other healers to to help with these other
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.800]   additional aspects.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.520]   Oh, that's yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah, there's so many
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.360]   different options, you know, and I guess it really depends on
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.160]   first diagnosing what the issues are. And then finding the right
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.880]   fit for you right in terms of modality and the individual to
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.280]   help you as a healer. So I think, you know, I mean, do you see
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.280]   right now as it stands, like, it really seems to me because I've
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:58.480]   been studying this for a couple of decades, that, you know, as
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.560]   the progression of the healing arts, you know, you know, grow and
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.280]   evolve, that we've kind of reached this whole new level
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.120]   now, you know, this this quantum space because prior to Leila,
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.680]   there really wasn't any, I mean, you know, there's little gizmos
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.240]   and things like that. And you got people tinkering around with
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.560]   scalar energy and all that. But nothing has for me personally,
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.920]   move the dial as much as quantum energy. You know, your devices
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.920]   are pretty amazing. So I mean, what do you see as the next gen,
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.360]   you know, like, like the next step, I mean, in terms of healing,
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.160]   you know, because right now there's so many people that are
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.560]   coming into our chat group, right? And they're asking all these
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.320]   different questions about their particular issue. But I mean,
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.520]   what do you see in the future? Just as our as my last question
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.920]   of where this is all going to go? I think that, you know, as a
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.440]   healer, what do you what do you think about that?
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:56.120]   So we have something coming, I think, which will also help define
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.880]   a little bit of that journey. I don't want to say too much right
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.920]   now, but we'll talk about it in May. But what I see coming is
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:11.400]   really that the consciousness of a lot of people, a lot more
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:16.640]   people than in the past will actually expand or they will
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.440]   sit differently and better, maybe a lot more people will unlock a
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.400]   lot more of their consciousness. And therefore, they with all of
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.560]   that together, they will raise or we will altogether raise the
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.320]   vibration here on earth. That sounds pretty big, but it's it's
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:38.720]   really actually happening. And I and I can't even foresee what all
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.600]   will be possible when in when we're in three years here and a lot
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.680]   a lot more of that will be unlocked. So we will see a lot more in
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.200]   regards to frequency medicine, quantum and distant healing,
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.960]   it'll become a lot more normal. People will naturally
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.120]   understand it a lot more just because they're open up more, give
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.800]   you one example, which is quite fascinating. So we've spoken
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.840]   about David Hawkins before, and his book power versus force, and
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:16.040]   where he set up the the Hawkins scale, which is basically
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.560]   consciousness levels that he set from zero 1000 like everything
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:26.400]   above, I think like 350 or 250 is getting into like unconditional
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.960]   love and things like that. And then at some point, you know,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.960]   they're different states that you can have, or that even places
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.880]   can have, and then between seven and 1000 would be like the
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:44.960]   Buddha consciousness. So at the time where he set it up, he
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.960]   couldn't look any further than 1000 and it actually wasn't even
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:54.320]   possible here on earth for something physical to vibrate at a
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:01.400]   higher consciousness level. Yes, unseen in the non physical,
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:06.080]   obviously, but not in the physical, it's different now, and
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:11.560]   we actually just had our seventh generation infinity block
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:17.960]   tested. And I kid you not, it's at 1152 on the Hawkins scale.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:22.520]   I'm showing it on the screen right now, that's, that's over
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.680]   the top, that's past 12 dimension full consciousness.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:32.120]   Yeah, or you could, yeah, it's higher than what was possible
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.440]   at the time at that time, it wouldn't even have been possible
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.240]   for us to create a seventh generation just because the
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.080]   circumstances were not there and the vibration here on earth
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.280]   was not there and not ready, but it shows it's really moving
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.480]   into that direction that now it is possible. And it's it's
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.320]   fascinating. And we had that, you know, tested multiple times
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:02.440]   to be really certain. And yeah, it is what it is, but it should
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.400]   should be a great message for people though, because it's
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.880]   moving. Yeah, no, it's it's fascinating. It is absolutely
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.880]   fascinating. So to wrap it up, you as a healer, so you mentioned
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.880]   you don't take clients as you know, as as a healer, is that
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.880]   kind of like where you're at right now, you don't actually
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:27.560]   take on clients. I do. I do. You do? Yeah, I do. But I don't I
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:32.840]   don't talk about it really. I don't offer it anywhere. It's you
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:38.720]   know, when people feel that I can help them, or they reach out
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.560]   to me and they're looking for a healer, usually I refer them
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.080]   always to someone else, because it's really not my focus. But
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.000]   you know, I still do that every now and then. Okay, and do you
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.360]   do that through the path of love? Is that kind of if people
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.640]   were to reach out to you as a healer? Because you know, right
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.760]   now, all the different healers have their own websites. So
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.000]   like, but I guess since you don't actually focus in on, you
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.320]   know, your heat your avenue of healing is Layla Quantum and
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.960]   providing the tools for people to expand their consciousness
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.320]   right. But so is that something that if people were to want to
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.560]   reach out to you as a healer, would that be kind of quote your
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.240]   website? The best would actually be through telegram, the
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.120]   quantum power will click on my icon, send me a private message.
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.280]   That will be great. You could also even send an email to
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.440]   support@lead.q.com. And then they connect you to me. That's
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.040]   definitely possible.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:35.760]   Okay, well, thank you very much. I really appreciate the time.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.200]   And you are a definite fantastic member of the Layla Quantum
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.440]   healer network. And I definitely look forward to talking to you
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.000]   more about about this in the future. But thank you for your
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.400]   time this this morning.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.520]   Thank you, K. All right, have a good day. You too.
